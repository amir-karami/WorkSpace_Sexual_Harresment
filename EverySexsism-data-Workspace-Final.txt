"When I was 17, I worked in a clothing store that sold both mens and womens clothing, as well as some unisex items. I was working overtime in the evening, around 8.30pm during the winter so it was already dark. I was by myself on the shop floor as my manager was cashing up in the stock room, when a man in his late 50s/early 60s came in and started asking about the winter boots we had on special offer. We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said “Whilst you’re down there, why don’t you take one for the team?”. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn’t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just ‘ignore it and don’t get upset by it’! Even when I think about it now, it makes me extremely uncomfortable. "
"I left my job to return for a PhD with an intention of developing expertise in my field and preventing encounters with men who label me “ignorant” or hint to my own incompetence. Part of my PhD requires public engagement via social media. In one such recent Twitter encounter, I stated my opinion and backed it up with facts. A man that disagreed then proceeded to lash out, calling my remarks “effete” and “ignorant.” I called out the blatant sexism, for which he continued to retaliate, calling my tone condescending. This is such a nasty cycle and I find it so extremely frustrating…if we sit back, it happens more. And if we speak up, sexism intensifies. We have our work cut out for us. "
"A leaflet about “supporting teenagers” in my country published by so called “experienced” psychotherapists contains a lot of pernicious gender stereotypes. The reason why I despair about living in my country is that girls get stereotyped as behaving one way and boys get stereotyped as behaving the opposite way, even when in reality there is a lot of overlap of behaviours between the sexes! In the leaflet, girls are automatically assumed to be “vulnerable” and in need of “empowering”. This is kind of offensive and degrading to many young women who are capable and self sufficient. Some women do not view themselves as “helpless victims”, but instead as highly capable survivors! Calling girls “vulnerable” or fragile doesn’t help them deal with stuff in an adaptive or a resilient way. While it is true that some young women struggle with issues around eating (please don’t use the pathologising words “eating disorder” because it is society’s expectations around food that are disordered, not the young women themselves). Once again, the fact that many young men also engage in anorexic or bulimic behaviours is conveniently ignored by the leaflet. This is sexist because young men are under pressure by the media too. Young men are pressurised to be lean and muscular by society and this cannot be ignored! In the leaflet, girls are called “over conscientious and perfectionistic daughters”. Seriously? What is wrong with doing things thoroughly and properly? Do people want girls to slap-dash and half finish tasks? Would you want an airline pilot who didn’t do safety checks before take-off, a doctor who prescribed you the wrong drug or a nuclear power plant worker who was not conscientious? I mean come on, some jobs require stringent “perfectionism” or you get fired or sued because a slap-dash attitude would cost lives! In Chemistry Class, I had to titrate chemicals according to strict concentration values in solution. If I measured the mass of chemicals wrong or used the wrong volume of distilled water, the experiment would not work and the results would have been useless. I had to also be thorough when writing up lab reports because marks would be deducted from my final grade if I was not. It is fantastic to aim for perfection because it meant that I obtained maximum marks possible for the planning part of the Chemistry Coursework. Nothing beats getting 100% marks on a task, it is truly an awesome feeling! So no, I don’t think that girls should be denied the opportunity to excel by people who call them “too perfectionistic”. Heck, what this world so desperately needs is more high achieving young women! Even TV competitions such as “dress making” or “bake off” require precise measurements and the right amount of ingredients for the clothes to actually fit or cakes not to explode in the oven respectively. Lots of women take part in these shows and do well. Please, instead of pathologising girls and young women for their hard work and diligence, praise them for it! Give credit where credit is due for crying out loud! I do sense that in my country there is a culture of anti intellectualism and dare I say it, people are jealous of young women’s achievements, so some teachers, parents and “professionals” tell girls that they are “too perfectionistic” or “over contentious” because I don’t know they are envious of the female youth today? My grandmother liked to do things thoroughly and properly as part of her job. She would be rolling in her grave now if she heard that young women are actively being discouraged from being conscientious and doing a thorough job by “well meaning adults”. In some Asian countries, such effort and thoroughness by women would be praised and actively encouraged. I am amazed at how young women and men are encouraged to strive to do the best the can and aim for high standards in some Asian countries. The toys, the games, the TV shows, everything encourage people to try hard and improve themselves. Young women in some Asian countries are told that perfection is a virtue that they should strive for. While this has the unfortunate effect of some Asian women wanting plastic surgery, it does mean that Asian women are lauded for the “perfection” of the hard work that they do in intellectual pursuits. In the leaflet about “supporting teenagers”, boys are unfairly stereotyped as all being “laid back ‘do it all at the last minute’ lads”. I have seen some boys spend hours researching in the library weeks in advance of a deadline. Lots of these young men were boys of Asian origin, but there were definitely some white Caucasian boys and all other ethnicities of boys studying hard too! This is why it is sexist and unfair to label the entire male gender as “laid back” and lazy in this way. Sometimes being “laid back” isn’t lazy at all! Sometimes one needs time to mull over and consider all options carefully before reaching a decision. Some people like to look at the “big picture” of the situation before they focus on the details. I have also met sone “laid back last minute” girls who were high achievers! Fun fact: a close female friend of mine had a habit of leaving her homework until the night before it was due. Despite her procrastination, she always ended up getting A grades. Explain that then “psychology experts”! Oh wait…you can’t… I have also met some very lazy, unconscientious girls who often didn’t submit their homework at all! Some girls really are bored and disengaged with school as the “Lauren Cooper” “Am I bovvered?” sketches sadly parody. This leaflet is part of the problem, not part of the solution. If you stereotype males as lazy and disengaged with studying, it may become a self fulfilling prophesy because some adults had low expectations of them! Wouldn’t it be better instead to encourage everyone to be thorough, aim for high standards and do their best regardless of whether they are female, male or other? Just sayin’… "
"As a 16 year old girl, I know very well that sexism exists. On pretty much a daily basis, I am shouted out from car windows whilst walking down the street, or approached by strangers whilst out in public, usually by older men. This is something that as a female, you get used to, enough though you shouldn’t have to. One thing I will not get over though, is being told that sexism is not an issue. I take a sociology class at my college, and one of the subjects we cover if feminism. This is something that me and my friends are passionate about, we believe it needs to be talked about in order for things to change. There are however, a number of boys in that class who disagree with feminists and try to tell us everything we say is wrong. I can accept this; everyone is entitled to an opinion and I am willing to listen to anyone’s opinion. Today it reached a point where I can no longer just accept their opinion. As a group, we watched the Everyday Sexism Project talk “CoventGardenWomen”. All throughout this, they laughed and just completely ignored the facts being presented to them. After around 10 minutes, one of them asked for the speech to be turned off because “we get her point, she can stop complaining now”. When questioned about what they found so funny, they told us that there’s no reason for women to feel unsafe whilst walking alone, that sexual assault isn’t a problem, that if it really happened more women would come forward. And that was my breaking point. To be told minutes before that 1/3 women will be raped at some point in their life, it’s heartbreaking to still see how insensitive people can be towards these topics. As a victim myself, I can personally say that people victim blaming is the reason I don’t want to tell everyone what happened; I am scared of being laughed at, or told it’s not a big deal. People like them are the reason women choose to suffer alone. But please, tell me again that sexism doesn’t exist. "
"I read pages and pages of this website and it made me sick in my stomach… When I was working as a library assistant in an almost all-female environment I never felt threatened: it was so different from what happens in all-male workplaces where a female employee is the odd one out… I do remember being approached by an adult male when I was about thirteen or fourteen and was playing an arcade computer game after school in the city centre: he got closer and closer behind me, and there was nobody around so I tried to ignore him and shifted forward. I just wanted to enjoy the game and had never experienced this He then got so close that his body was starting to press against mine.. I never looked back or said anything..I realised that something was horribly wrong and walked away from him, and out of the arcade hall… It was bright outside, the city bustling with people and I quickened my pace, looking behind me… I climbed onto a bus and thought that everyone around me knew, that they could see what had happened… I felt dirty, and disgusted… I understood then what girls were experiencing, the reality of what a lot of women deal with, the emotions that go through you when a stranger targets you for unwanted sexual contact… I am disgusted to see that twenty-five years on I still see the same attitudes from men, condoning this kind of behaviour…I can walk down the street at night or any time of day without fearing sexual comments or assault, whereas all the accounts in this blog show that it is never the same for women… As an ethnically different man living in the UK (the incident in my teens happened in my home country) I get people in cars and vans shouting unintelligible things at me – always men – and that always makes me feel victimised, because although I cannot hear the words I can sense that they are meant to diminish me. I want to say this: sexual harassment and violence is not a ‘women’s issue’, because men are responsible for it, therefore it is a men’s issue, our issue. I want to try harder to change things, and I want to be brave (or I hope to be) and challenge sexism when I see it… I am horrified by what I read in this blog and I want to say this: we, men, can do better, so much better than this. I want to ask any man reading my post a question: have you ever had the urge to touch a female colleague, waitress, stranger (etc.) inappropriately, or to make suggestive remarks to her? If any man thinks that it is harmless, he should read this blog and realise the impact it has on women at the receiving end, how horrified, belittled, disgusted, and powerless it makes them feel… I hope more men will join me in stamping out harassment of this kind and taking a stand to make it a thing of the past.

"I worked in a doggie daycare for two years as the front desk manager. I saw many of the same clients regularly, day after day. At least two middle-aged men often would touch my shoulder for no reason while we exchanged pleasantries as they dropped off their dogs. They may have thought they were being nice, or friendly, but it was creepy and uncomfortable and as I was in my workplace and my job was to be polite and courteous to all customers I never felt ok to point out how it made me feel or ask them to stop.

"A few months ago my husband’s workplace (in a liberal, northeast state) had an event at a bowling alley, a fundraiser in a series of playful competitions with a rival company. To form bowling teams in anticipation of this event, my husband’s general manager sent out an email to the entire company stating that each bowling team would need “one very skilled player , at least 2 above average players, and a female.” You know, because “females” can’t be “skilled” or “above average” at bowling, obvs. "
"Working in the IT area, I am most of the time the only woman in the office, in my thirties, between men of fifty mostly. With the tempratures coming up and approaching summer, I arrived in the office in a summer appropriate dress, receiving comments all morning. This was nothing comparing to the feedback of a colleague, twenty years older then me, who constantly stalks me around and makes the others believe we are lovers, ocasionally touching me and commenting on my body. This time I told him not to touch me in a polite way. His reaction was quite surprizing – he went to the other colleagues complaining about me to tell him not to touch me, when actually I look so nice – means I should be only flattered. For me, I dont see this to be an excuse to be touched, espacially in an adult management oriented environement. I am afraid of staying with him alone in the office or in the room, and sometimes I preffer to stay home and work from there to actually woork in peace. I constantly think about if I gave him in any way an excuse to behave like that, because I am afraid to break the atmosphere of the office with raising a complaint about it. Every time I tell myself – ok, next time you tell him this is above and HR can be involved…. This experience just digged out some memories that i though are already forgotten…that since I was seven years old attanding school, boys from my class were touching and kising me without asking, having fun this way, and the touches continued also when I was at high school, by totally different people. From what I remember from these years, it was just my body being not mine… That time I was an introvert not able to tell anyone what I am going through or to say out loud that I dont like that. I believe now in my thirties its a big lesson for me to learn to start saying what I dont like and out loud. Thanks for this site to be able to share my story. "
"I think that sexism is an issue in the UK. This is because women’s pay is significantly lower then men’s which is biased and unfair. We are also described with much more feminine verbs, and also those which describe where we participate and do a lot of teamwork, yet not as much independent. This is also more unfair for us as men are described with more independent, strong and powerful words. In workplaces, a large percentage (52%) of women are sexually harassed, and made to feel extremely vulnerable. In many cases when these situations are reported to their head of work, they are dropped or under-prioritised. "
"My boss has a history of sexually harassing women at my workplace. He is a prominent artist, and most people idolize him without realizing that he is a predator. Every woman in the office has a story. Mine is the many long hugs he gives under the guise of “I am an affectionate guy” and with responses afterwards such as “You really understand what my work is about here”. I have been told on two occasions, “If you want to keep your job, you will take your clothes off for me” to model. My manager was pulled onto his lap and her breasts groped. When she pulled away he said, “What, it is not like I have not felt breasts before”. Recently he sexually assaulted a coworker and it ended in a non-consensual sexual act. He paid her $50,000 and gave her a $13,000 painting to make it go away. I am so angry at her for accepting, for not standing up to him and protecting the rest of us. But this is also not the first time a pay off has happened. It also occurred 6 months ago before this whole new batch of employees was hired? But we are in North Carolina and working in a company of less than 15 employees. Federal sexual harassment laws do not protect us in the same way, and there is very little we can do. What happens when it is the owner of the company that is harassing you? What can you do when the policy is to “Tell your manager” but she has no authority over the owner. When he intentionally keeps the company under 15 employees for this very purpose? When the company has a 95% turnover over the last 6 years since it began? What can we do, as women to make it stop? How can we send the message that this is not acceptable? When the artist says that his success is the continuing evidence that all is forgiven? That “All of the most famous artists had bad reputations”? But I seem to have only the option to quit and fade into the background. I do not want to do this. I want to make something happen, but how?

"Over the last year I have noticed sexism from other women which, before it happened, had never crossed my mind. This particular realisation related to other women’s perception of assertive behaviour in the workplace. It seems that it is acceptable for men to be assertive – their thoughts delivered in whichever way they choose – but when women are ‘assertive’ in the same way ( using the same words, the same tone of voice, similar body language) they are labelled aggressive; not by other men, but by other women. "
"I am male. I used to work at a law firm in Central London and want to highlight two rather disturbing experiences. First was an extremely disturbing exchange with a female colleague. We were discussing a case involving charges of historical sex abuse in a marriage (our firm was not handling said case, but we had heard about it). My colleague’s response to this: “I just don’t understand – how can she say she was raped? I mean, they were married! It’s not rape if it’s your husband!” I was utterly shocked by this attitude and how her tone suggested how ubiquitous it was. I was never raised with sexist attitudes (my mum saw to that, for which I thank God every single day) and had honestly never encountered it so brazenly in my entire life. I argued the point with her, telling her that regardless of the case itself, marital rape is completely unacceptable and can never be justified or excused. If you force someone to have sex with you against their will, it is RAPE, regardless of whether they are married or not. I felt like this was bordering on “mansplaining” but I was just so horrified. She looked at me like I was completely insane. Second incident involved the same colleague. She was being repeatedly harassed by another colleague, who made suggestive sexual comments to her and gave her unwanted and sometimes threatening and over-bearing attention. She wanted to report her to senior management. I’d witnessed some of this, so I told her I’d back her up if she needed it. She told the senior manager about her problems, who reassured her that he’d speak to the guy and tell him his behaviour was unwanted and completely unacceptable. Instead, he handled he matter very inappropriately. His method of admonishment for workplace harassment was to say in public, in front of the entire staff (including the woman who was being harassed): “Be nice to —– yeah, she’s a good girl.” To which harasser replied: “F*** off man, don’t try to be a hero.” I should explain – this is a tiny firm. There’s no HR, no levels between management and employee and the office was small and claustrophobic. My female colleague was completely humiliated. For my part, I was really f****** angry. Maybe this is somewhat sexist in itself, but I felt like I needed to make an effort to stick up for my colleague, because she probably wasn’t going to complain again after this incident was handled so poorly. I waited until I could speak to the manager alone and asked for a quick word. I very politely suggested that it would have been better to admonish the harasser on his own, rather than in front of the entire staff, and make it clear his behaviour was unacceptable, because he had clearly not taken his previous “admonishing” seriously. Manager’s response? “Don’t tell me how to do my f****** job.” I have since left the firm. "
"I’m a social worker. I’m also 26, female and have visible disabilities. In my role, we have our work overseen by a independent reviewing officer. He was older, white and male. In the course of three months, he proceeded to reduce me to tears twice because of vicious, personal attacks, threaten to refer me to the registration body three times, pin me in a corner, tell me I should have mental health counselling and tell my manager that i had failed to do a critical part of my job for six months (he was lying). When I finally went to his manager, he decided to tell my entire department about how my stress and poor mental health is leading me to make wild accusations. The best my team manager could get was that his contract wasn’t renewed – and so he moves on to another workplace to traumatise another woman. "

"In a meeting today…17 men and 4 women. 10 of us were visiting so didn’t know where everything was.

"Today, they brought in a pretty face to distract the clients while negotiating the terms of a multi-million dollar contract. The contract manager told my manager who told me. My manager had question why this woman was apart of it as she has zero qualifications and she is no longer employed with us. This pretty face hasn’t worked for our company since her temporary position ended a year ago. She was only there to cover a maternity leave for our administrative assistant. Our company has had this contract for over 30 years. The expansion project our client is planning is going to result in major growth for our own company. We have an excellent relationship with them and the bid for the contract has been tailor made for us to win it. To lose this contract would be a major blow to the company and maybe it has the Executives desperate, I don’t know. I do know this woman wears short skirts, giggles lots, flirts endlessly and enjoys the attention all the men at work give her. She started dating one of the managers, 30 years her senior, before she terminated her employment with us. My coworker is going back on maternity leave and this woman will be returning. I am going to speak up. The contract is huge and I wonder if the client knows a non employee was present to hear the negotiations and used to distract them? In good conscience I can’t keep quiet about it and I’m going to the HR department with a letter. I don’t know if this woman knows she is being objectified and I am not seeking to get any kind of justice against her. I want justice in the workplace for other woman like me who are working hard and will not use their sexuality to appease perverted minds for personal gain. I want the men to know that this behavior is no longer going to be tolerated. I am taking a stand and I am scared out of my wits. What is helping and I didn’t fully expect this but my husband is acting more outraged than I. He’s standing with me and encouraging me to see this through. He gives me hope and shows me what is possible. "

"I was sexually assaulted by a man at my workplace, a large hospital. He was a contractor, there to supervise the installation of new HVAC equipment. From the very first day of his time at my workplace, he did inappropriate things to me. When I was sent to his office to set up his computer, he put his hands on my shoulders and began massaging in a suggestive manner. I told him to stop and left his office. About a week later, I was in Medical Imaging, installing another computer. He was walking toward me with one of the men from Building Maintenance. As soon as he saw me, he began talking loudly to the other man about how ‘cute’ I was, how he was going to ask me out, how much he wanted to get me into his bedroom. The other guy looked mortified but said nothing. I pretended that I had not heard him and carried on with my work. Not long after that, I was up pulling new data cables in a vacant area that was being transitioned from an outdated patient care area to office space. He was cutting through that area and spotted me alone. He grabbed my wrist and yanked me toward him, causing my body to collide with his. He then used his other hand to grope my breasts and buttocks. He still had my right wrist in his grip and would not let go despite me fighting to get free. He then leaned in even closer and said “Women are supposed to like it when a man wants them!”. At that point, I shrieked right into his ear, which startled him into letting go of me. I ran into an empty former patient room and locked the door so he could not get in. I remained there for about half an hour before racing back to my department. The next morning, I complained to HR. He was not punished at all. He didn’t get anything more than an instruction from HR to leave me alone. He faced no consequences at all. This, in addition to a few other problems, were why I ended up burning out and leaving that entire career. "

"While I’ve experienced lots of sexism over the years (I was once catcalled when walking home in a black dress. I was on my way home from a FUNERAL), I feel I’ve been relatively lucky not to experience that much sexism in the workplace. Don’t get me wrong, there have been a few instances where I’ve felt uncomfortable, but nothing overt. I’ve always worked in organisations with a social conscience and an ethos of equality, so things have been broadly fair – I’m well respected and my gender hasn’t really been an issue. That said, my entire exec team are men, so there’s probably a problem there somewhere. However, in my spare time, I’m on a board of a small charity. We’ve recently appointed a treasurer as we were missing that skill set. The man we’ve gone for is excellent at his job. He’s in his 60s and has recently retired from a big global company, where he was a senior accountant. During his first meeting, he spoke exclusively to the men in the room and didn’t even look at the women. I gave him the benefit of the doubt – after all, he was just new and perhaps wanted to direct himself towards the chair and the chief executive (both men). At subsequent meetings though, it’s become clear that he has a real ingrained but subtle sexism. He talks over the women in the room. If he’s challenged on,any of his ideas, he doesn’t speak directly to the woman who has challenged him, but instead to the men. And for the first time ever in my professional life, I’ve seen that hideous thing whereby a woman makes a point, he repeats exactly the same thing and gets the plaudits. Honestly, it was like some sort of cheesey corporate video showing sexism in action – except this was very very real. I’ve not challenged him directly as I’m not sure he even knows he’s doing it. And I’m reluctant to speak to the chair or chief executive for fear that they’ll say I’m too sensitive. He’s also v good at being treasurer and definitely brings something to the table, and I’m guessing my issues will be overlooked because of that fact. I’m trying to deal with it by being an extra good board member. By speaking up more and showing what I can do. However it just shows again that a woman has to do more than a man to be taken seriously. "
"I went to a job interview yesterday. I was applying for a waitressing job. The male interviewer greeted me and introduced himself etc… One of his first questions to me was ‘Are you single?’ – I mean really… Is that relevant in a job interview? The conversation then proceeded as follows: Me: ‘Umm.. why?’ Him: ‘Because girls like you can cause problems – I don’t want my staff screwing about or screwing each other’ (Girls like you – the man doesn’t know me) Me: ‘Well I have a boyfriend so -‘ (I was too stunned to even think really) Him: ‘Good, that’s good. Because the guys here would be all over you if you didn’t – actually it might not matter that you have a boyfriend anyway’ Then he swiftly moved on to the next topic. I couldn’t tell if he was joking – but even if he was it is not acceptable to ask anything like that in an interview or make a girl feel that the workplace is full of predatory men and her their prey. I left the interview almost in tears. No man would be asked that question or told that. "

"I had one work colleague, a woman who described herself as a feminist and clearly enjoyed expressing her femininity (she’s the only person I’ve met who uses ‘girlie’ as a noun to refer to herself), who was very disparaging towards women who did not conform to that ideal. We had a few androgynous and openly gay women in our workplace, and this woman spent a great deal of time making fun of their appearance and dropping homophobic comments about them (by contrast, she adored gay men). It was depressing to see a self-described ‘feminist’ perpetuate this sort of gender-policing nonsense; I don’t know whether it was full-blown hypocrisy or just a total lack of self-awareness. "

"A female relative read â€œPiggy Bookâ€? by Anthony Browne to me when I was small. The plot bothers me today, but I just blindly accepted it as a â€œnice bedtime storyâ€? when I was little. WARNING BOOK PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD In the story, Mrs Pigott was clearly frustrated at being taken for granted by her sons and husband. The males seemed to think that it was a femaleâ€™s job to do the ironing and the cleaning. One could argue that the men were being lazy and misogynistic towards the woman. However, looking back on the story as an adult, I have another plausible explanation. Before Mrs Pigott ran away from home and left the misandric note â€œYou are PIGS!â€? for the males, there is no mention that she encouraged or even tried to teach the men how to do domestic chores. I wonder and I speculate now whether or not the menâ€™s laziness was in fact cluelessness: maybe the men expected the woman to do these tasks because she had just done those tasks without being asked and they honestly didnâ€™t know how to iron or clean! Because the men had never been asked politely to do the chores, they didnâ€™t do them! In the story, I think that Mrs Pigott should have kindly helped teach the men how look after the house. If she had helped set up a washing up or washing machine rota for everyone instead of storming out of the house, perhaps this would have made for better relations in her family. If she had tried to do this first, I would have had more respect for her. It really bothers me that the female relative who read this book to me has called some men â€œstupidâ€? and â€œlazyâ€? for not doing the chores. This has set a bad example for me and has sadly meant that I have dealt with men not doing the chores in an unsympathetic way. I later discovered that these men had no idea how to use a washing machine because their Mums had always done their washing for them. My relationships with men have been damaged by â€œmen are lazyâ€? attitudes because the traditional men expected me to do the ironing and washing up, but I replied in an angry and upset way, which just made the men angrier. I am sad because as a little girl, I used to cheer when Mrs Pigott â€œmended the carâ€? at the end of the story. What of Mr Pigottâ€™s â€œvery important jobâ€?? He is the main breadwinner and he would be tired after coming back from work. What about his needs and important contribution to the family? Calling his job â€œvery importantâ€? in a mocking way belittles his hard work to care for his family and thatâ€™s not fair. Mrs Pigott works double shifts at her workplace and doing domestic tasks at home. I understand this, but this still doesnâ€™t negate the fact that her husband is working hard long hours to earn money and he should be acknowledged for his efforts. Also, I donâ€™t see what would be wrong with Mr Pigott mending the car and Mrs Pigott ironing if thatâ€™s what they were good at and the jobs got done. Some people in some families divide up the tasks in traditional ways and it works well for them. There would also be nothing wrong with Mr Pigott and the boys ironing and Mrs Pigott mending the car, as long as the tasks got done to a good standard. The main thing is that the work is divided up fairly and it all gets done. In conclusion, the â€œPiggy Bookâ€? contains misogynistic and misandric elements. Calling men â€œPIGSâ€? for being clueless about domestic chores Iâ€™ve learned hurts men more than it helps. It makes men resentful and makes them believe that feminists â€œhate menâ€?. Men need sympathetic understanding so that they can learn to do domestic tasks and women have to take responsibility for teaching them how to these tasks. Some men may resent doing these tasks and may get justifiably angry at being called â€œlazy PIGSâ€?. Some men think that going to work long hours and earning lots of money is enough contribution. They may be angry that the women in their lives donâ€™t appreciate them for their efforts outside the home. Men and women need to respect each other. Men and women need to help each other learn how to do certain tasks. There is nothing wrong with men and women doing traditional and non traditional tasks as long as these tasks are divided up fairly. Sadly I was not taught this as a small girl and â€œPiggy Bookâ€? plus a female relativeâ€™s dismissive attitudes towards men didnâ€™t help me deal with and negotiate with traditionalist men either. The blame game just resulted in a world of emotional hurt and broken relationships for all concerned. Thatâ€™s really sad. "
"The Formerly Quiet Feminist I haven’t really posted on Facebook/Twitter for a good few years now, mostly because I haven’t had anything that I really needed to say that couldn’t be communicated by other means to the people who needed to hear it, i.e. close friends and family. But this morning something happened to me that caused such a tangle of emotions and a subsequent a crystallisation of my views on a particular subject that I felt for once, it was time to “share”. What happened was as follows: I was walking to work as usual with my boyfriend, chatting casually about various news items and plans for the weekend. A white van drove passed us and the driver of it leant out of the window and shouted directly at me (there was no one else near us on the street): “YOU SHOULD DO SOME SIT-UPS LOVE!”. He drove past quickly so there was no chance for me to process what he said or to respond. For a moment I was shell-shocked, trying to work out if I had heard correctly. I asked my boyfriend if that was, in fact, what he had said. Somewhat sheepishly, he confirmed what I had heard, but said “you shouldn’t listen to scum like that, what a complete loser. You know you look beautiful, don’t let him upset you.” Before I go into more detail about the three stages of my reaction, I will say that I have always considered myself a feminist. A quiet feminist. Quiet, because quite honestly, I often find myself confused by the barrage of sometimes contradictory messages to today’s feminist. You have BeyoncÃ© and Rihanna, strong, empowered women, with their own particularly sexual brand of feminism. Then you have Sheryl Sandberg and Arianna Huffington with their guide to conquering the boardroom by acting (some would argue), like successful men do in order to be taken seriously. Overall I find myself confused by Page 3, “jihadi brides”, “Leaning In” and every other current issue which affects women. Should I dress sombrely in the workplace in order to be taken seriously in a male dominated industry, or should I wear clothes that make me look and feel sexy and beautiful and to hell with those who can’t handle that? What I found out, at the end of the rollercoaster of emotions set off by the incident detailed above, is that beneath the noise, being a feminist today is incredibly simple. My first reaction to the incident above was, somewhat pathetically, Embarrassment. I immediately looked down to check my stomach and see what had caused the comment. I felt a devastating urge to run home and change my clothes. I checked myself, leading to my second reactionâ€¦ Defiance. My rational thoughts moved to, “WELL SCREW YOU MATEY, I do actually do sit ups â€“ several times a week in fact”. I recited in my head all the exercise I’d done this week: yoga, Pilates, free weights, even a run before work that very morning. I thought to myself, “well you looked pretty great in the mirror when you left the house this morning and you haven’t gained three stone since then so, who cares what he thinks, you look great”. I also thought to myself how he’s probably a very sad individual if he needs to go out of his way to wreck innocent women’s days in such childish fashion, and that I’m probably infinitely more successful than he’ll ever be. In the words of Jack Nicholson, “I don’t care what you think about me, I don’t think about you at all”. I was about to put the incident out of my head entirely and carry on to work as usual but was suddenly overcome by hot tears indicating my third reaction, a furious sense ofâ€¦ Injustice. My boyfriend said “don’t cry, he’s not worth it”. I replied, “No, he’s not, but I am”. And by “I”, I mean every single woman in the world who has to put up with this kind of sexist twaddle. I am right to be annoyed by this. No man should feel that he has the right to offer up comment, be it positive or negative, about a woman’s appearance when that woman is simply going about her own business in the street. I am not a fashion model; I am not a trophy wife, I am lawyer at a prestigious firm in the City of London who has a first-class degree from a world-renowned university. My body is nobody’s business but my own and how it looks is irrelevant to my achievements and the job I do. What struck me was that no man would ever offer up this type of criticism in this fashion to another man in the street, and indeed it is hard to imagine a woman would ever do so to a man. Yet I can’t help but think I’m not alone in this experience and it is clear that what we are dealing with is everyday sexism at its zenith. I imagine some might read this and think “oh get over it, there are far bigger issues out there”, and they would be right as regards this particular isolated incident. What makes them ultimately wrong however, is that this incident is an illustrative microcosm of how a significant portion of the male population views and treats women (as objects that should be nice to look at and nothing more), and how society in general values beauty above any other quality in women. When men and society view women in this way, as beautiful/ugly objects, it’s only a matter of time before some of the more sinister consequences of sexism start to poke through the cracks. Rape, domestic violence, inequality of pay, and a whole epidemic of girls with low self-esteem are just some of the natural consequences of the objectification of women. Once a woman is viewed as an object and not a person of equal worth, she becomes that much easier to abuse or to step on. Well ladies, I for one have had it with this bullshit. It’s time to get angry. It’s time to protest and call out every little bit of sexism that you experience. For your own personal sanity it’s also worth reminding yourself of step two (Defiance) when such incidents occur, but I also implore you not simply to forget and move on, but to share your experience and shame the perpetrators of this stone-age nonsense. I’m no longer confused by my opinions on BeyoncÃ©. I will no longer ruminate on whether my clothes are “serious” enough for my job. Feminism should not be confusing â€“ it is equality of the sexes, pure and simple. No woman is an object. Let’s fight this â€“ together. Alex Thomson, 9 July 2015. "

"This morning in work within an hour I had two experiences that jolted the term “everyday sexism” into my consciousness. 1. An male colleague who I’ve had only ever passing engagement with addressed me as “princess” 2.

However, I also felt like if I said anything I’d be the one who would have a “problem”. "

"To use the words of one of Shakespeare’s favourite fools, as women, if we smile not, we are gagged. Last week, I and two other female teachers (all under 40 years old) had requested a conflict-resolution meeting with our school principal, a white male in his 50s, to address a difficult ongoing conflict that we were facing with an uncooperative male colleague, who is also a teacher and department head. The meeting was wrapping up and the resolution was not tidy — we were asked to understand that our male colleague (who is in a position of responsibility and leadership in our school) needs more time to be mentored. Then, just as we were about to leave, one among us was told: “C’mon [name], smile…” Smile. Smile? Why is it as women, we must smile and smile, or be a villain? "

"An 18 year old boy in my school with two sisters said that women get paid Â£5000 less then men every year at the same job because they MIGHT get pregnant. This made me so angry. Just because I am female it means that I get paid less money because I might get pregnant. A man’s pay wouldn’t be reduced because he MIGHT be off sick with stress for 4-6 months. (it might happen) He said that it was the capitalist society fault because women are apparently less reliable to do their work because of family life and that I should stop moaning. Why should that matter!!! A woman should have the same right as any man, and just because that’s the way it is, its okay. No! The reason women get paid less is due to sexism in the workplace. We are seen as inferior because we have uterus’s. I’m not blaming all men. But how did this become the norm? how is it that me, a girl of 17, will earn less money than men because I might get pregnant. This is not a good enough reason. What if I never have children, that’s Â£250000 more a man will earn then me at the same job through our 50 years of working. How is this right? Why is this still a problem in 2015? "
"I had an interview for an internship with a major German employer and was telling my current co-worker about how well I thought it went. When I said that I didn’t want to get my hopes up just yet as they were also interviewing plenty of other candidates, my (male) colleague laughed and exclaimed that I shouldn’t worry about it because I’m a girl, and apparently this company always gives preference to girls. I quote: “A friend of mine did an internship there and all five interns in her department were girls. It’s happening all over Germany, women are just at an advantage of finding a job nowadays.” Now, there are two reasons why I was annoyed (and offended) by this statement: Firstly, my colleague was implying that the reason I should not worry about the interview was the fact that I am a girl – not because I was a highly qualified individual who has gained significant experience in the field (which I have) and might actually, genuinely deserve the placement. By putting it down to how easy it (apparently) is for girls to get into this company, he was discrediting me and my professional expertise. It was the typical reaction of a man who holds a “fear of losing out” to the women who are increaingly enter the workplace as equals. So, to make it very clear: If I do happen to get this placement, it is because I am QUALIFIED for it – and NOT just because I’m a girl!! Secondly, the company’s Board of Directors consists of two men and two women, which (although quite progressive for our times) by no means indicates a preference for females. If nothing else, this is what true equality – WITHOUT preferential treatement of either gender – should look like. Just over half of all employees are indeed women – but again, this indicates a fair and equal distribution of positions between the genders rather than an “advantage for women”. Quite on the contrary: A recent study showed that this company was among the Top Five popular potential employers for recent female graduates in Germany, while it did not even make it into the Top Ten for their male counterparts. This indicates that a lot more women are applying for jobs with this employer so (if we apply the same rationale that is often used to justify male dominance in “traditionally male fields”) you should technically expect the proportion of female employees to be even higher. Plus, on a wider scale, only 37 per cent of leadership positions within the company are currently held by women, showing that there is still a long way to go before true equality is achieved. But apparently having five femalae interns in a department would naturally mean that girls just have it easier in this horrible, emancipated world… If nothing else, we should be asking why girls are only getting so many internships rather than high-level positions!

"Hello everyone! i am 30 y old now. When i was 19, during uni studies, i worked at a restaurant. At the 28th off October 2005, a bartender from the restaurant came in my home drunk and raped me. I didnt say anything cause i tried to convince myself that it was a bad one night stand. For 4 years, i suffered from agoraphobia, and when i got a boyfriend and told him the story, he broke up with me cause he could not cope with that. I ve been harassed in buses and subway or in the street and i am really scared walking alone. Now that I am 30, i have my degrees and i am a film editor for 9 years. I have a boyfriend the last 5 years and i work in a totally fallocratic environment. Every fucking day my colleagues say something sexistic for me or even my boyfriend who drives a motorbike but not a car, so hes not man enough. every day i work twice than some male colleagues to prove i am good enough. I am fast and good and creative at work and i know it well. But i cant say it. As i cant wear a dress or wear red lipstick. The one thing I know is that my man is man enough, cause hes there to support me with those thoughts, to cook for me when im late, or give me orgasms instead of not driving a car! And also that my boobs are big enough to provide milk for my future child, and my brain is good enough to cope with those assholes. Good luck ladies out there, stand on your feet! We are all brave!

The thing marketed to women and girls is just for women and girls. "
"Last week I had a man approach me at the retail store I work at. This is the third time he has approached me and every time the interaction becomes more and more heated and violent. He is angry that I do not remember him from one class we had together in high school 20+ years ago. This last time he began yelling that “an entire effing year of his life had been wasted” We had one class together more than 20 years ago, I never saw him before and I never saw him again afterwards (until that first time he approached me) and he somehow thinks that I owe him something. It has gotten to the point where I make sure to have someone walk me out to my car at night after closing the store because this guy is so fixated on me. I don’t remember his name or face. The last time I was verbally assaulted by him, he said he went to the Homecoming dance with one of my friends. I sent her a message and she can’t remember what his name is either- maybe Richard or Rick. I obviously made an impression on this guy, but if I don’t remember you- just cut your losses- don’t continue to come in and scream at me that “an entire year of your life was effing wasted” an entire year, 20 years ago at that.

"Triggered and depressed by today’s rant by an IT guy on the IT security comments section who complained about “an agenda” because the person in the photo was female when the malware flaw was discovered by a male. The photo was stock illustration of a female nurse because the IT bug has affected the NHS most. Even the other male commenters were like, bro you’ve missed the point. No point me jumping in as he would have loved a fight with a female. To his eyes that’s them implying that women can be competent at IT and unfairly rewarding women when he clearly doesnt want any women in IT. Where do you start with men like this who can’t see their own massive agenda and are just desperately scrabbling to be the little male victim of meeeee toooo sexism. Because yah IT really hates males….

Awful industry for straight women. "
"My first experience was when I was 6 years old. i was extremely tall for my age and because of this my kindergarten uniform was a little short. My teacher told my parents that i should wear shorts under my skirt so that my underwear would not be revealed. She also added that it was to protect my modesty from the male staff and students. (the oldest students were 7) I became the object, the lure for a man’s sexual appetite. Keep in mind the fact that I was underage. I understand the part of ensuring that the students did not see as they would probably have made fun of me, but the fact that the male staff were a concern deeply upsets me now. My second was at 8 years old when I stopped hanging out with the guys in my group of friends. I was always the only girl on the team when we played any sport, yet I loved my dolls and princesses like any other girl my age. It all stopped when the boys stopped wanting me on their team, when they told me to “go play with my dolls” and I never really got that superhero themed party I always secretly dreamed about, but then again it’s not like there were many female superheroes to choose from. Suddenly pink was my colour, dolls and princesses became my best friends, and the usual roughhousing we did while everyone was gathered didn’t include me or any of the other girls. My third was at 10 years old when I told my grandparents that I wanted to take up football (soccer) i had recently quit swimming due to time constraints with the day and time of the classes. My whole family is crazy about football, the English Premier League in particular, and like any young, impressionable 10 year old, I wanted in on the fun. When I told them I wanted to play football, they immediately said, “NO! You cannot play! You are a girl! If you play you will become a tomboy! {i have a feeling they were referencing homosexuality} It’s too rough for you! Why don’t you play a more feminine game, like tennis?” Again, being a young, impressionable 10 year old I gave up on my dream of maybe one day becoming the female version of Lionel Messi or Steven Gerrard. When I recounted the incident to my parents they agreed with my grandparents and said, “they are right, football is a very rough game! It’s not for girls like you.” As time went on, I learned that somethings are for girls and somethings are for boys. I also learned the restrictions and precautions of being a female. My fourth experience was at age 12 when our female teachers told us that we had to sit and stand in a certain way so that we seemed “lady-like” and “feminine”. While this was being said i thought to myself, “Aren’t the reproductive organs on my chest, which due to health complications are more developed than the average 12 year old girl in my all-female school indication of my gender enough?”. Apparently, the answer was “no”. I had to act demure and gentle, while my true manner of behaviour was a bit more rough and bold. I refused these double standards. Why aren’t boys told that they cannot laugh loudly? Why aren’t boys told that sitting a certain way equates to flirting? Why aren’t boys told that you must walk with soft steps? Why aren’t boys told to never go out alone at night? Why aren’t boys told that what the girl wears is not an indication of consent? Why are boys told that a man who is sexually active is “successful”, “lucky” or someone to look up to but girls who are sexually active are “sluts”, “whores” and “easy”? Why is a female who is sexually active frowned upon, while a man is not? Why does my country not have a single female Prime Minister throughout its 50 years of independence? Why do so many mothers leave the workplace because their careers don’t go anywhere after childbirth? Why are women around the world ostracised, discriminated and denied basic human rights because of their gender? These are just some of the many questions I had 2 years ago. I am now 14 and have the answer. People are afraid of the change women can bring to the world when you give them the power, the equal rights, the same standards you give men. If a woman can bring a life into this world by carrying it inside her for 9 months and letting that life drain her energy and at the end of it, still love that life with all her heart, if she can go through 1 week of torture every month where her body goes through an excessive loss of blood and can still function normally, what’s stopping her from changing the world? Nothing. Yet, my friends complain about being given different expectations from male relatives and friends their age, I have had my grandmother jokingly talk about marriage to me on several occasions while my brother has had only one, I go out on the streets in a fitting t-shirt and jeans and have people staring at my breasts like I’m a piece of meat and all over the world women still get discriminated against. I say we should put a stop to this and tell the world why women need to be treated the same as men; because when sexism stops, gender norms are destroyed and it’s a win-win situation for everyone.

"I want just want to highlight some of the major sexism I’ve dealt with. At age 13 I went on a motorcycle charity ride with my father. A man, I’d say probably on his 60’s, was making comments to me about how “sexy I was” and how there was “no way I was only 13”. I was disgusted that a man the age of my grandfather and that also had a woman WITH him was saying these things to me. Not only that but his “date” laughed at the things he was saying. Right after I turned 16 I went to a party and had my first alcoholic beverage. Never having had a drink before I had no idea how much it took to be drunk. I kept getting handed shot after shot and before I knew it I had a man on top of me (19 years old) and raping me. I remember not being able to move and telling him to get off of me he continued to say “call me daddy” “I want you baby”. His friend walked in the room and walked right back out. The next day I was talking to his friend and I asked him if he heard me. He said “I heard you screaming, I’m sorry he’s such a pig” yet when he heard it happening he had done nothing. I never told anyone in fear of being called names and being blamed for his actions. When my rapist told my ex-boyfriend what happened he emotionally and mentally abused me publicly and privately for a year till I left that high school. He said I was “a stupid whore”. He would even throw footballs and other things at me when I went to the HS football games. When I turned 18 I got my first job in a bakery at a supermarket. The deli was right next to me and I always finished my job early so I tended to go over and help with dishes and cleaning up in the deli area. I worked double what the men in the deli worked, was constantly praised by my manager on what a good and thorough job I was doing and still got paid $7 less than the men in the deli that were constantly late and always did a lazy job. Less than a month into my first job I found out how much sexual harassment went on in a workplace. I had one co-worker on particular that would constantly say “can I grab your ass” “what would you do if I grabbed your ass?” “I would hit that”. The men in the deli even had a game they would play when a woman walked by they would rate her. Even the older men would rate these women that were the same age as some of their daughters. Another incident when I was 18 I went over to a friends cousins house, we were supposed to be going Black Friday shopping, the cousin was our ride over there. He started groping me when my friend fell asleep and when I refused him and asked him to take me home he replied with “find your own way home and lock the door on your way out”. I want to point out that I never even thought of these things as being wrong, except for the incident when I was 16, until I watched Laura’s TED talks. I didn’t even mean for this to be so long, as I was writing things that have happened to me over the years just started to come back. It’s sad that this is the way things are and I grew up thinking this was normal. If I was your mother, sister, cousin, friend, girlfriend, etc. would this be acceptable to you?

"I work as a librarian in a secondary school. We are quite often contacted by people wanting to donate some of their books to us, which is always nice. So, one day, I get a phonecall from this guy who has books to give. I say we’ll gladly take them all and we arrange a rendez-vous. He gets into the school with his car, in which are quite a lot of boxes full of books. Sadly, the library is in a not-so-accessible building, and on the third floor, too. I tell him (by phone) where he can park to be as close as possible to the library building, take a hand truck and go to meet him. We proceed to pile some boxes on the hand truck, and I naturally start to maneuver it, because : 1) It’s what I usually do in this kind of situations, regardless of who is with me (and I do have to do it quite a lot) 2) I consider that, since I’m the one wanting the books, and he’s already been kind enough to drive to the school to bring them, it is only natural that I take over 3) I’m used to both the hand truck and the school : I know where to go and what path to take to have as little difficulty as possible 4) He’s elderly (like in his 60? or 70?) and I’m barely 24 at the time 5) I actually enjoy maneuvering the hand truck! …and the guy literally pushes me out of the way, telling me that HE should do that because, I quote : “I think I’m still stronger than you” (read : “stronger than a girl”). And I let him do it, at first, because what do I know ? Maybe he actually IS stronger than me! I mean, I had met him only 5 minutes ago, for all I knew he could have been a weight-lifter-champion and go to the gym every day… Except that, after something like 30 second of pushing the hand truck, he starts complaining that it IS quite heavy, and that maybe we shouldn’t have piled up so much boxes, and why all these students lingering in the hallway (it was recess) can’t help ? So, he was basically saying that ANY BOY (either an 60-something old man who obviously isn’t all that strong anymore, or a 12-year-old student who has absolutely nothing to do with this whole business) would be better than me to use the hand truck and lift those boxes…even though I actually do it on a regular basis, because it is part of my JOB! BTW, we had to make a second journey, since we hadn’t moved all the boxes yet, and that time, I insisted on pushing the hand truck, and that YES, he could put ALL the remaining boxes on it, I can manage!

"The sexism in my previous job was so endemic, no-one took it seriously. It was just “banter”. To the point where it was considered OK for a male senior manager to give a presentation describing his team that included the phrase “our ladies of Credit Control, using their feminine wiles to make clients pay their bills”. I wasn’t the only one offended, and someone must have reported it, because next day he sent an email apologising for his “inappropriate” behaviour. My immediate superior assumed it was ME who made the complaint, because she had heard me say I was unhappy about being described that way. She had the nerve to ask me to apologise for ruining the team event – which I refused to do. She and her direct manager then sent public emails to the Director saying how they had “appreciated” his comments. Talk about letting the sisterhood down! A few months later that same manager was discussing a new female hire with some of the guys in the team. She made comments about the length of her legs, bra size, and speculated about who would be first to ask her out. I was so enraged by this that I posted a hasty FB message which included calling them all fools. Of course I took it down later but one of my well-meaning friends decided to tell the manager about it “what have you done to upset my friend?” was their question. I got an email next morning from the manager telling me how disappointed she was that I had taken a conversation “out of context” and “potentially caused trouble” for the staff involved. Um, wasn’t it THEM who were grossly out of order for talking about the new hire’s bra size?! I chatted to the guys (they had all seemed uncomfortable with the conversation) and I chatted to HR. NO-ONE took it seriously enough to consider a formal complaint. It was brushed off as “banter” and I was advised that “if you don’t want to listen to it, walk away”. So my question here is: we all know sexism exists and many people are doing great work in the media and in everyday situations to try and combat it. But what happens when unhelpful/offensive/outdated gender stereotypes are perpetuated by women who consider objectification normal??? When females try to force other females to conform to their ideal? Easy to ignore a lot of the time, but in a workplace where your boss considers looks more important than brains, causes a lot of trouble!!! "
"I told my (male) boss that I was watching the ted talks about this sexism. He responded by rolling his eyes and saying the problem with discussing sexual equality was that often you don’t hear the full story and the reason for the sexism. He suggested that maybe there is more backstory to the issue. I consider my boss to be a good friend and quite open minded but the sexism in England and this work place is so deeply entrenched I don’t believe he thought twice before spouting out that nonsense. I regularly don’t get invited to hang out with my closest friends in the workplace as it is a ‘boys’ gathering. I don’t really understand as I do all the things they do- I check out women (I am bisexual), I am extremely vulgar, I have a dirty sense of humour. In no way would they have to modify their behaviour in the slightest because of my presence. It is purely my being a female that disqualifies me from hanging out at these gatherings. I tried to protest when my boss responded so negatively about sexism. I tried to open his mind but I had to actively push myself to speak out. My heart was beating quickly and I felt afraid to say something even though what he said upset and angered me so deeply. I am so sick of this work place. I am so sick of comments like ‘that’s just what girls are like’ and ‘yeah women’ said with a sneer. I try to point out that it is ridiculous stating roughly half of the population is a certain way and liken it to saying that all Indians or Australians are a certain way. If I say anything along these lines my two male bosses look at each other in a ‘here we go again with this nonsense’ kind of way. I don’t want to speak out as no one incidence has been particularly horrible but there is an underlying sexism that bothers me every single day. All of your voices give me strength. The more people I hear talk about sexism the more I want to be one of the few that does speak out. Every time somebody tries to belittle me for stating that there is gender inequality in the world I feel more angered into discussing sexism more frequently. The amount of people who don’t even know that sexism occurs is utterly alarming.I am ashamed that I used to feel ashamed to call myself a feminist. The backlash of feminism has had such a sad and lasting affect but it is time to speak out. "
"When I was 9 years old, I was sexually assaulted by a boy who was 15 at the time, that was my first kiss, which was the worst experience in my life. Later on by the same boy and his friends I was sexually harassed and assaulted for many years after until I was probably 15. The same boy would constantly tell me to beg my parents to stay out longer so he can have his way with me by groping, touching me in inappropriate places, and press himself agains me imitating sex, like in porn, he would hump with his clothes on and pull my hair so I’d cry. I was also sexually abused by my own older brother, he would watch me having a bath, he’d walk in to the bathroom asking me to open my legs so he could see what I look like down there. I never had any boyfriends or any intimate experience with a man for a long time after, I was traumatised, I honestly hated men, sexual harassments never stopped, groping, touching, calling me inappropriate names because I wouldn’t pay attention to group of males calling out for me, it doesn’t stop! I have been fairly pretty girl with large breasts, comments and abuse I get is constant. I don’t find it flattering, I am normally distressed and anxious and just want to be left alone. Once I was walking down the street and some men rolled their window of a white van down and shouted ”get your rat out” at me. My boyfriend was with me at the time and just told me to ignore them. IT is weir how he has accepted women being harassed as a normal thing, he tells me to avoid places, to wear less revealing clothes, and I mean like skirts over my knees and anything that doesn’t’ show my cleavage. Now I am nearly 24 years old, and my terrible past experience has damaged the way I feel about men. My own dad when I was younger used to hit me, many times. If I left bike in the mud, or didn’t hoover the way he wanted for me to, I’d be punished by not being allowed to leave our house for months, if I did anything wrong he’d throw things at me, milk bottles, garden hoes, electric wires, I’d go to school liking about my bruises.My mom never stood up for me , because she was afraid of the hassle. My brothers were never ever treated like that! They were able to go and do whatever they want, because dad didn’t worry about them apparently. On daily basis, even my own boyfriend who I have been with for nearly 6 years is not supportive, he absolutely hates anything to do with feminism. I feel like things should be getting better, about the way men disrespect women, with all the information you hear and read nowadays, but I feel like nothing has changed. I am afraid to be myself because of consequences it might lead me to. I don’t have any children, but if I do boy or a girl I’ll teach them respect regardless gender, I really hope one day this will stop, and girl won’t have to go through what I went through, and still do every day. That’s why I don’t really have a social life anymore. Speaking about social life, I had a major concussion because I was pushed through a metal gate on a main road at the night club, because I pushed a man who tried to kiss me away, and before that happened, I lied to him that I was engaged to try to get rid of him, because he kept touching me and coming close to me, saying how he wanted to screw me, after I told him I was engaged he shouted at me saying ” What the fuck I am doing here then?” I didn’t know what to say, I was out with my best friend, not bothering anyone just catching up. When I told my boyfriend about it he said, that maybe I shouldn’t go clubbing anymore. All my life I have had to make decisions to try to avoid situations like this. My brother were never told off for not cleaning the house or washing the dishes or not cooking the dinner, I was always, because I am a girl. Even today I will be most likely the one to do all housework, because that’s my job! Men in the house do hard work they are always tired, but I work 9 hrs a day which is on average 2-3hrs more that they do, but I am surpassingly not tired! Frustrates me.But because all of this is ”normal” me a lone I can’t fight it! So I just go with it hoping that a lot more people will speak up about this! Experiences sexual harassment at work too, a man in my team, constantly would say inappropriate things to me, and not just me, all women in the office, he never got in trouble for any o itf, every time when you went close to him he’d touch your lower back or comment on your breasts, but he got away with it because it was just a ”banter” everywhere you go sexual harassment from men, if they sense you’re getting upset they straight away say it’s just a banter, or you don’t understand jokes, can’t have a laugh with you etc. THIS HAS TO STOP, I don’t have enough years to write every single experience I’ve had, and I swear there’s plenty more! Laura Bates, I have watched all your videos, I believe in you, and I am happy I’ve found you! Now what I know there’s women out there who also fight for women and men being treated with respect, I feel like I can actually say something too, instead of ignoring people, I will actually stand up for myself, because I don’t want to accept being sexually harassed, being disrespected or not given enough credit just because I am a woman, weaker ,more vulnerable sex as people claim.

"Constant discourage and lack of empowerment – positive reinforcements that never comes from older, male colleagues (and I am the only woman, also the youngest in the team), constant overlooking of my abilities and achievements and looking for a new person to delegate work.

"I have experienced hundreds of accounts of everyday sexism through the majority of my lifetime, from strangers and people known to me, in pretty much every area of life and some have stuck with me more than others. I’ve had continuous street harassment, mainly including comments about my body. One man shouted at me “Nice lipstick, would look better all over my dick though” whilst I was on my way home from work and walking past a bar. I’ve had friends and colleagues telling me they would be able to convert me “back to being straight” (I identify as a cis gay woman). I’ve been groped in nightclubs. I’ve been groped on buses. I’ve been groped walking down the streets. I’ve been continuously hit on in gay clubs that are supposed to be my safe place. I’ve experienced two separate incidents of rape, both in my own home, and both by men that I was close to and trusted, at the ages of 15 and 18 (both men were the same age that I was at the time). I’ve had rumors concerning my sexual activity spread throughout my school and as a result of this been groped and harassed in my classes as a 15/16 year old. I’ve been followed home.A drunk stranger came into my home when I was 12 looking for my mum who was not there and refused to leave again, intimidating me while I protected my younger sister. I’ve had assumptions made about me that I would never be able to complete my degree and that I would drop out before the end of semester in my first year (I have now successfully made it to my 3rd year and am close to getting a 2:1 degree). I am tired of this but I will continue to fight back because this is our world too, and we all deserve to feel safe in it. "

i got an internship and during the first week of my internship people sent me to get and serve tea all the time for about a week but i didn’t mind because i assumed that’s just what interns do till i noticed after about two weeks that they never sent the male intern to get tea even if he was idle and i was busy they would much rather stay hungry till i finished what i was doing than send a man to get tea. till one day i basically told them to f**k off as serving tea is not in my job description. 
"Irritating colleague of mine consistently invades my personal space, airs his regressive views on women loudly and frequently and interrupts me at every opportunity.

When I came back he was still bending the ear of another straight male colleague and blocking the gangway, and when I tried to manoeuvre past to get to my desk the other colleague hit me on the boob. Cheers for that guys, as a survivor of repeated sexual assault including at my previous workplace I found it pretty triggering to be honest. "

One of the sales guys at work just explained to me how payment terms work…I’m the accountant… 
"Where do I start…? At the age of 16 I started my first part time job. I was sexually harassed by every man in the restaurant kitchen where I worked, every shift for about a year. I was very innocent and naive but had started going out with a boy and knew men found me attractive. There was another girl working there who was at least 5 years older than me. She heard and saw them making fun of my slim body shape, lack of curves, whilst also making crude suggestive gestures regarding what they would like to do to me. I felt so uncomfortable and it made me self conscious for most of my life. I’m 35 now and looking back what upsets the most is that I didn’t feel able to tell anyone, I felt I didn’t matter and wondered if it was normal for guys to behave like that. I’m also very frustrated and angry that the business owner who tried to be kind and ‘paternal’ towards me, let this happen and laughed along, and that the older girl didn’t say or do anything. That was just the start. Since then I’ve been harassed and bullied in the workplace by very senior male business men in my office jobs, I’ve been inappropriately touched in the workplace too. Female colleagues thought I was having an affair with a man old enough to be my father. instead of support, I was gossiped about and sniggered at and accused of only getting promoted because of my looks. I felt I had nowhere to turn. I have been sexually assaulted twice in bars/clubs and most recently once in a packed public lift, in broad daylight whilst my baby daughter was with me. On this occasion I did go straight to the police and reported it. Although he couldn’t be identified I feel proud that I finally took some action. Oh, can’t belive I forgot this one…being photographed about 10 years ago, up my skirt in a high street shop. I didn’t even know it had happened, he had tricked me into dropping something and another shopper told me she saw him do it using his phone. The security guard got him to delete the picture but told me there was nothing else he could do, and no point going to the police. He also said the guy had hundreds of similar pictures on there…I felt embarrassed and ashamed and violated. I started to feel it was just me, and that I must somehow invite these incidents. I had some happy relationships over the years and some not so good. Then I met the love of my life, and later had my daughter. Not all men must be tarred with the same brush and I couldn’t be happier in myself, with my body and strong sense of sexuality. I have been defined by these events for too long, and will not let them shape my future, but I worry about how I will teach my daughter about relationships and identity. If one single tiny element even remotely similar should ever happen to her, I don’t know how I would cope with the anguish. I’m constantly aware that women all over the world are suffering much more than I ever have, being raped, physically abused or worse. It doesn’t change the fact that this ‘everyday’ behaviour in our society cannot continue. I don’t know what the answers are, but teaching boys about respecting women has to be a start? Making sure all boys know that pornograhpy doesn’t reflect real relationships, or represent the way women wish to be viewed and treated could also help? It makes me feel physically sick to think of some of what I’ve gone through, but I’m a strong woman and mother and remain a loving, kind person who sees good before I see evil. If contributing to this project can help anyone in any small way, then that is positive. I chaired a women’s forum in my last workplace and I know that discussion is key to prevention of workplace sexism. Any steps we can all take to make changes have to be worth it. If anyone is living with similar experiences right now and feeling confused as I did, please tell someone. If anyone sees this happening to someone else, of any gender, please also tell someone. No matter what you look like, what you do or what you say, receiving this kind of behaviour is NEVER okay, and it’s never your fault, no matter what. Peace to all. X "
When the workplace anti-harassment rep suggests a voice-over would be “less annoying if it could be changed to a male voice 
"About six months ago a man whom I did not know and had never met before messaged me on the social networking site Instagram asking me if I wanted to meet up for sex. I explained to him that I did not meet men off the internet for sex, and that I had a boyfriend. He wouldn’t let it go and spent a good hour pestering me, telling me that it didn’t matter that I had a boyfriend and asking if he could come over right now. Eventually he stopped and I screenshotted all his messages, posting them on Instagram explaining how outraged I was that a man would contact me in this way expecting me to meet up with him to have sex, and persist even after I had told him no numerous times. A few days later, I received a message from this man explaining that it was not him who sent the messages, it was his friend as he had been using his friends phone and he had left himself logged in and asking me to take the messages down from Instagram. I didn’t believe him, I thought he was just trying to cover his tracks as he has been caught. He sent me around 10 messages, which got increasingly nasty asking me to take the messages down. I refused as I was not going to be bullied into removing the posts simply because he said it wasn’t him. He then contacted me over Facebook and LinkedIn asking the same thing but I still refused. Then the phone calls to my work started. He had obviously found my work details on my LinkedIn account and started telephoning my work asking to speak to me. By this time I was absolutely terrified, I thought this man was going to turn up at my work, I felt sick when I was walking there, I refused to answer the phone, so I reported him to the police for harassment. After six months of investigating, the police came round to see me last night. They are not going to charge him because firstly they believe his account that it was his friend who sent the original messages (without actually having spoken to his friend) and secondly, they say that I am to blame for leaving the screenshotted messages up on my Instagram account. I felt absolutely sick, you hear about victim-blaming so much in the media but to have it happen to you by two female police officers is utterly devastating. They said that in the circumstances his conduct was reasonable and he didn’t consider it to be harassment. I’m sorry, but since when did stalking a girl you don’t even know on the internet and telephoning her at her workplace constitute as ‘reasonable behaviour’? The irony is that I actually work for a criminal justice agency and up until now I had the utmost faith that the system would protect me. I’m absolutely gutted, I feel like I haven’t been listened to and as there’s nothing that can be done through the justice system anymore I thought that posting my story here was the only way to make my voice heard.

Watching this week’s #MadMen but thinking that women in the workplace still have so much BS to deal with 
"I do marketing and design for a small local company and have spent the last few weeks designing a brochure to send to potential clients. It was a tedious process, but i was incredibly happy with the finished product. Today was final tweaks and sending off to print, but unfortunately my tummy issues flared up and I had to work from home. Whilst tweaking the final design, I noticed someone else in the office was adding their own ‘tweaks’ to my Dropbox folder. ‘Tweaks’ here meaning using elements of my design but totally changing it. Said colleague then sent me an email saying he had tweaked the design and felt it worked better (he is not a designer). When I tried to explain that I wasn’t sure about the new design (it looked like it had been made on word) he told me email correspondence was too inefficient and they would be finishing the design in the office and sending it to print. After weeks of working to make this something I could be proud of, I now won’t get to see my finished design until it arrives from the printers. At no point was I asked if I minded my designs being chopped and changed (I never have any issue with people suggest amends), he just went ahead and thought he could do a better job in 2 minutes. Maybe I’m overreacting, but I’m pretty angry that this male colleague thinks he can do my job better after two minutes, and I’m also pretty angry that I’m being shut out of the conversation because of my illness "
At the age of 16 in my first job as a waitress at a local tearoom. My female employer used to encourage us to serve an older gentleman that would often compliment us on our physical appearance making comments on our legs etc. Unfortunately there seemed to be a correlation between the younger the girl the bigger the tip. Unfortunately because it was such a small scale cafe we relied on tips. 
"My older boss (He’s in his 50’s I think) told me that when I ask clients how they are and I speak with them generally, my enthusiasm comes off as being very “sugary and fake”. For clarification, I’m genuinely a people person; I speak to people so enthusiastically because I’m genuinely interested in how they’re doing and in how I can help them. Apparently, this makes me fake. My co-worker has been there much longer than me and in all her years there, she has: – often worked for free (Over-time etc) – been ignored when she has had serious health issues to deal with – Been told “all your problems would have been solved” if she’d died during surgery – Been told she should get ready to buy her own coffin soon when she turned 30 – Been openly mocked and ridiculed for having had an eating disorder – Been told that wearing make-up makes her look like a clown and will scare customers away – Has had it implied that her choice of dress and make-up makes her a “slut”, thus causing several colleagues to outright shun and ignore her. – Been told to keep her depression (caused by this mistreatment) to herself and not to bother anyone else with it. It’s horrendous. We’re not perfect but we’re both nice, caring people who don’t deserve this mistreatment and abuse, a lot of which seems to be gender based. "
"My earliest memory of sexism in the workplace came when my manager started sending me flirty texts. Being a 16 year old and consequently not interested in 30 year olds (especially 30 year olds interested in 16 year olds), I ignored them. I was henceforth treated like a sack of crap. I always laugh when I think about how pathetic his only verbalised insult was: one day I had chipped nail varnish and he said that, because of this, I “looked like a single mother”. Seeing as I was raised by a single mother into a strong, independent and educated woman, whenever I notice that my nailvarnish is chipped it reminds me of how amazing, resilient and strong my mum is. And then I have an inward laugh at that fucking tool. "

"My workplace is going through some financial difficulties, and our new (male) CEO announced he had to make some redundancies. Every single one of the six post made redundant was held by women in their early 30s (therefore potential maternity-leave takers). One had just come back from maternity leave. And one had been chatting about how she was planning to have a baby. Of course, there is NO way of proving this is a sexist batch of redundancies. The ‘strategy’ just demonstrates that these were the posts we could make do with losing. But, considering our small office is around 50/50 male/female ratio – it seems odd that a full 100% of the redundant roles were held by women… "
"Arriving at my large open plan office where hot-desking is the norm I find no free desks among my usual crowd. I spot one free desk in a group of six. Four of the desks are occupied by men. The other desk has been reserved but is unoccupied. I ask if it’s ok for me to sit there. I’ve been at my workplace for 3 months and don’t know many people outside of my immediate team. “Sure,” pipes up one of the men “as long as you don’t mind passing on make-up tips”.

"I am eighteen and work in a small local supermarket and my role during this shift was to re-stock the drinks and shelves. I was getting some drinks out the trolley when I felt a pat on my bum and a “Hey there possum”. I exclaimed “Excuse me!” and turned around to see who had taken such a liberty and felt entitled enough to touch me. It was a man (redacted by moderator) (40-50 yrs) from a real estate agency a couple doors down from the supermarket. He regularly comes in and had taken to calling me “Possum” – hitherto I had taken no notice of the pet name because I am regularly called things like “chicken” and “darl” when I’m on the register. However at this moment I was sickened and at my exclamation he turned around and shrugged as if his action meant nothing. He was still smiling. I shouted across the aisle, “That is degrading!” But by then he had turned back around and begun his shopping. There had been other customers present and I was surprised that none had taken notice to the event that had just occurred. I was shocked. Angry. Humiliated. How could he – a man who I had respected and been friendly to, turn out to be so “entitled” in his belief that he had the right to touch me in such and intimate area? I felt betrayed in my judgement and like I couldn’t trust any other male customer with whom I’d become acquainted. He made me feel inferior and objectified. Who did he think he was? But he was a customer? I couldn’t go and hurt him like I very much wanted to.I was then called to the deli to serve another customer and missed my chance to confront him there and then before he left the shop. Instead I told my supervisor and she checked the camera. I was still shaking. The camera missed the footage of him touching me, only capturing me turning around in response to the sexual harassment and his nonchalant shrug. I began to cry. My supervisor was supportive and I am very grateful for her behaviour. She wrote it in the incident book and told my boss. My boss was to talk to him next time he saw him. But this wasn’t enough. I let everyone at work know. I talked to my boss when he came in next and he said he’d called human resources and since there was no actual footage of Bill Douglass’ harassment, we could not confront the latter’s boss to get a response. He said that the best he could do is take him aside and have a chat. Still I didn’t feel completely satisfied. I couldn’t hide behind my boss – my MALE boss – and let him fight for my right to my own body. So the next time the man came in; I knew it was now or never. Fight or flight. So I ran after him, calling his name across the street. He looked nervous. I said, “I want you to know that What you did on Saturday – it was unacceptable.” Before I could say any more, he said “I know and I sincerely apologise.” And that was it. I don’t believe that he is sorry, I think he only said it to stop me harrowing him in a public place. But I needed to confront him for myself. I was proud after that; I could feel the adrenalin leaking through my limbs. I felt content – not through him, but for my own assertion. A few days later, my mother said she had spoken to the HR department at her own workplace about my situation. They had said that despite there not being direct footage of the sexual harassment, the mere reactions of both parties was enough to take to the police and file a complaint. Why did my boss tell me I had couldn’t take legal action? My grandfather asked me a couple of days after the event; “Don’t you think that it was MALE EXUBERANCE?” Still, despite the disparate generations between this man and my Grandfather it becomes obvious that in this patriarchal society women are still viewed as sexual objects. The workplace should be a safe environment – hell, EVERYWHERE that I go should be a safe environment. They say that we are equal; why then are we continually sexually harassed and justice does not prevail? "
"I work in a department of the US Federal Government. I also happen to work virtually, though occasionally team members would get together in a coffee shop. Two days after the election, I met with a co-worker that I had been especially close with over the past year. After I worked on our work as he surfed the internet, he would occasionally show me pictures or articles about how democrats were being violent in protesting or other nonsense. When he showed me a picture of the president-elect grabbing the statue of liberty by the vagina, I pulled out my phone. I showed him a picture of a gay man who was brutalized by Trump supporters. He became enraged and began telling me incredibly sexist and violent jokes, i.e. What do you say to a wife with a black eye, nothing, you’ve already told her. He also ranted for approximately fifteen minutes about a range of issues and took aggressive positions, standing over the top of me and leaning. When I left the coffee shop, I panicked. I had PTSD from both the incident and a rape that had occurred 15 years ago. I finally called my boss to report the incident and asked for him to be taken off the project. (I was his project manager, so this was technically my project.) My boss was enraged and encouraged me to pursue action through HR and ensured me that he would stand behind me. (The string of spousal abuse jokes are technically considered assault.) And he did. For two weeks. Then my boss fell silent too, and took a job a month later. I found out later through another co-worker that the man who verbally harassed me spun a totally different story where it was all my fault. So all the people involved dropped it. He spun a good story and I was just a prior rape victim who was making a big deal about nothing. Nothing has happened, the man still has his job. And I had to go through two months of therapy to cope. "
"I used to wear a skirt to work. One male colleague took it upon themselves to decide that I had made this wardrobe choice for his pleasure whistling at me every time I walked past him, even going as far as smacking my bum. I also caught him rating the girls in work out of ten, when discussing me he said “I’m not sure, look at that ass though”. I felt humiliated, I also felt that I couldn’t say anything as it was just labelled as harmless fun or ‘banter’. I no longer feel able to wear skirts to work. After telling male friends about this, they told me it was my fault for not telling my manager… no one blamed the male colleague because it was “probably just a joke.” "
"“I am constantly reprimanded for my “aggressive” and “intimidating” behaviour in the workplace, but a man who I feel very similar to in terms of work ethic and management style was just promoted.” I’ve not experienced that personally, but it does annoy me when assertive/strong women are viewed in this way. They get accused of “wearing the trousers”, being “Little Hitlers”/”Little Corporals”/”Pit bulls in lipstick”/”bolshie”/”bossy”, “turning into men when they shout” (when they’re not actually shouting as such, they’re merely projecting their voices to make themselves heard!) & get referred to by such epithets as “she who must be obeyed”. "
"Last week I was in my workplace where I do 3 shifts a week as a lounge girl in a respectable pub.. I’m 19 years old and quite petite. One of the tables in the beer garden was a group of about 8 lads, around the age of 25-30.. after being super rude and whistling every time i served them that night I finally hit the roof when one of them came up behind me and sniffed and felt my hair and neck.. ‘She smells so lovely lads come have a sniff’ .. this encouraged them to chant and leave rude comments.. The way in which those grown men could think that was acceptable to do to a young girl is disgusting. I immediately told my manager and he had them kicked out. As we walked back inside he said to me ‘why does this always happen to you’ .. like I ask for it? "
"I took a gap year before uni and got a job in a large jewellery store. Despite being young I had 4 years’ experience in jewellery, and thought I was damn good at that job. After my first month I was on top of the sales table. Yet I slowly started becoming more and more uncomfortable there. The store manager pulled me aside after my first day and told me that my sales would improve if I undid a few buttons on my shirt. When a customer spilled a drink on the floor, he specifically sought me out to clean it up, since mopping is ‘not a man’s job’. Then I was selling a ring to a man when a male colleague came and took over my sale without asking, since it needed a ‘man’s opinion’. About 3 months into the job, I had a flare-up of an old ankle injury and needed to wear a brace. When I was called in for a routine job evaluation, I was told that I needed to put on some heels to look more ‘presentable’ and ‘take off the black ankle thing’. No mention of my excellent sales record, punctuality, or rapport with the customers â€“ all comments were about my appearance. When I explained that I couldn’t wear heels and had to wear the brace because of an injury, my manager gave me a stern look and told me that ‘we like the women to wear heels in this store’ and the brace was ‘hideous’. I stuck with the job since I needed the money, but I’m much more aware of my rights now. No one should be able to treat you like that in the workplace. "
"I have resorted to constantly wearing jeans and t shirts. Every time I wear a skirt or dress or shorts I receive comments or vile gestures. I haven’t worn any for 2 years now. It was an intentional choice at first. I wore a pencil dress to work, and had 2 male customers comment on my looking like a sexy secretary or simply making rude comments about my figure. They said these comments loudly to my face, as if they had no idea they would make anyone feel uncomfortable or awkward. I have only worn trousers and a blouse since, as I felt unable to prevent or stop these comments. Several colleagues overhead, and did or said nothing to intervene and help me. That mindset slowly eeped into my personal life, and I now avoid wearing anything that would draw attention to me or that could be considered sexy. I am disgusted that I’ve given in and adjusted how I live, but was unsure what to do as I work in customer service and my fellow managers and colleagues made no indication they agreed with my feelings. "
"As a teenage girl, my sexuality is often considered “too much” or “excessive,” because I’m so young. While working at my old job, (a restaurant) I came into work with a small, barely noticeable hickey. It was hot, so I couldn’t wear a scarf, and I have short hair, so there was really nothing I could do. My male coworker, named John*, came into work with a hickey that covered half of his neck. It was obvious what it was. When my boss saw my hickey, he started yelling at me, telling me that “that isn’t right for the workplace,” and that “I needed to reevaluate my priorities.” John, however, received no lecture or any punishment at all. This really rubbed me the wrong way. As a young woman, everything I do is constantly ridiculed, and I’m very tired of people saying that sexism ended when women got the right to vote. Sexism is a huge part of society, and it’s honestly pretty disgusting "
"At 19, I took a summer job at a local recruitment agency during my university break. I thought it strange that the agency – run by one man and staffed by one woman who was due to go on holiday as I started – should choose to employ me there rather than find me a temp job, but I needed the money and didn’t question it. For about the first week things were okay between me and the male boss. I settled into his routine easily and we got on well. He asked me what I studied at university and what I was interested in – I told him that I liked ‘artsy’ things and indie films. He made occasional comments about my short skirts and tight blouses, but nothing I considered intrusive or threatening, just a bit weird. The next day he came in with a foreign film to lend me, and from the cover I could see that it was definitely racy. “Just don’t tell anyone I lent you this”, he said. I asked my boyfriend (a film student) if he’d seen the film himself, to which his response was “…you do know that film is basically porn, right?” I quickly returned his DVD and made it clear that it ‘wasn’t for me’, but things began to escalate. One day he asked if I could sew – he had an important meeting and a hole in a pair of his trousers and asked if I would mind mending them. Stupidly, I offered to. Next thing I knew he stood at the side of my desk in his boxer shorts, trousers in hand, and asked me to mend them there and then. I left early that day. The following day he asked if I could open the office while he waited at home for a delivery in the morning – I was quite thankful to be on my own for a few hours. Except the keys he had given me only opened the door to the building, not the door to the office inside. I was forced to ring him and explain at which point he told me to take a cab to his house to collect the other key (he’d ‘forgot’ to give me the right set). I called my mum to explain what was happening – she demanded that I left the job and went home but I needed the money. I took a taxi to his house and told the cab driver what was going on. As we arrived at his house, the cab driver refused to leave me on my own. I’ve never been so thankful to have a stranger looking out for me. As I knocked on the door of the boss’ house, he answered, again in nothing except a shirt and pants, and told me to come in to collect the keys. At this point I threw his keys at him and got straight back in the cab. I never went back to the office. It taught me a lot about being naive and that no job is worth endangering yourself for! At 25 I’m far more savvy about my workplace rights and don’t take shit from any colleagues, be they male or female. "
"I used to work in the IT industry – very male dominated. In a meeting, where I was the only women present, we were discussing which consultants to pull onto a new project. When discussing prospective male consultants the conversation was around their skills and experience relevant to the project. Every time a female consultant was discussed, the conversation first focussed on her attractiveness and how ‘shagable’ she was, before any discussion of her skills or experience was raised. I was shocked and silent. I didn’t feel safe to raise my concern in such a male environment. A few days later, one of the managers that had been present in the meeting spoke with me individually to ‘apologise’ for the other men’s behaviour. I asked him if he had spoken to the men – he hadn’t. I was angry – I told him his apology meant little if he wasn’t going to tackle the issue with the men. Constant sexism and racial insensitivities did lead me to leave the industry. "
"Another episode I experienced was when I worked in the NHS and went to a mandatory training session involving about 50 staff from all departments. The training was being run by two professional women who were setting up their computer to link to an overhead screen on which to display their Powerpoint presentation. As the planned starting time passed one of the trainers called out. “We’re having trouble getting the computer to behave. Can one of you men help out?”. It took me – a man at the back of the room – to call back “And don’t you think any of the women are capable then?” Another story of how some women subtly and not-so-subtly, undermine their own gender, and so perpetuate the myth that men are needed to mansplain the world to them.

"When I was working for Telecom in Melbourne, Australia in the 80s, some men in the sales force had a gossip network set up dedicated to spreading sexual gossip about the women in the work place. They called it “The Investigators”. Management knew about it but did nothing to stop it. The gossip then was spread by Telex, so it didn’t have the reach of the internet but within the workplace it was toxic. "

"I have a part time job as a temp while I’m at university, and the first time I met the CEO was at the Christmas Lunch. He said ‘Hello, who are you?’ I told him my name and said ‘I’m a temp for marketing,’ to which he replied ‘oh no no, I think you’ll be an intern. It sounds sexier.’ It hadn’t even occurred to him that that’s not part of my job description, and that it would make me very uncomfortable; he didn’t see anything wrong with it at all. Fortunately I was quickly reassured by others to dismiss this idea, but his general lack of awareness or consideration about what is appropriate and how he is perceiving and treating his employees (not even his equals which is bad enough but the inferiors he has authority over!) highlights an underlying, and far too easily dismissible, sexism which I am finding increasingly difficult to call out and get people to acknowledge or change. Constantly being called ‘sweetie’ or ‘love’ by random strangers; made to move through doors by men with good intentions who nevertheless can’t see it’s far more convenient to just carry on holding it for them; being beeped walking down a street and wondering if something’s gone wrong with my clothing- at times school uniform- to find, no, it’s just being casually sexualised; all experiences which we know are absolutely not uncommon at all.

"It happened at my first job two years ago. It was my second day and I didn’t hear my alarm. I rushed to get ready, washed my face, combed my hair, got dressed and jumped into my car. When I parked my car at work, I was 5 minutes early, so I only had time to put on some foundation and lipstick quickly (I normally use blush, eye shadow and mascara). At the end of the day, my boss (let’s call him FE) asked me if he could give me some advice. FE then told me “You are a pretty woman, you should wear make up,” his face with a hypocrite smile. As he said this, I felt embarrassed. Yes, it was true that the day before I had arrived to work with more make up on my face… yet I had some on. I had foundation, my face looked clean, neat. I didn’t know how to react at the moment and I ended up apologizing, I told him I normally used make up, but that I was late that day and hadn’t had the time, and that it wouldn’t happen again. As I walked to my car I felt disgusted and mad. I felt stupid for apologizing for not wearing make up. One month later, I was waiting in the conference room for a meeting. I had been absent the past two days because my father passed out and I had called work to notify them, and FE had answered. I was sitting alone when he entered the room. My mind was drifting away thinking about the recent events. He paced the room and then he approached me and said “You don’t talk so much, don’t you? I got infuriated by his question but I acted like it didn’t affect me and said no. Was he trying to break me down? Was he serious? Was he acting like he did not know about my dad? He was the one who answered the phone, I had told HIM that my father had died. Yet this was the first time I saw him since that and he had asked me if I don’t talk too much. Two weeks after that he interrupted my class to discuss some paperwork outside the classroom. When I closed the door behind me and turned around to face him he stared at my stomach and then said “Are you pregnant?” Surprised from the awkward and out-of-place interrogation I said no and then he said “Oh, is just that you look a little nervous.” He then asked me about some papers and I returned quickly to my classroom, my students could tell I was mad. I wasn’t fat nor skinny, yet I kept worrying why he had asked that. I was mad at him for asking such a personal question. I told all my family and friends about this and some of them said it was sexual harrasment. At that time, I didn’t want to report him with the director, because I was scared FE would make me miserable at work (he was my coordinator) and that the director wouldn’t take it seriously or would tell me I was overreacting. One month later I quit because of different reasons, and not so much time after that I regretted not reporting him to human resources or writing a letter to the corporate office in Mexico City explaining my situation. And I still regret it, but there’s little I can do, because he quit his job there and migrated to the US with his family. "
"Confused and a little shocked in a new job in a city I had just moved to when on the Friday, all of the men left for lunch at 1pm. Noteworthy that one of these men had started in the office only a few days before me and was a local. Later told that I was not allowed to take lunch at 1pm on a Friday because of the standing Boys Pub Club! Ridiculed when I protested at the inherent sexism in having an event only the guys could go to on a weekly basis. I bet you can agree this was a simply wonderful welcome to a new job in a city where I didn’t know anyone. Is it much of a surprise that I lasted less than 6 months there? "

"My female manager (and co-founder of our start-up biotech company) constantly talks about how her experiences with sexism were terrible, worse than anything we as women in our workplace experience. But I don’t think that’s a good enough reason to discount the sexism my female colleagues and I experience everyday. Just because something is not as bad does not mean that it is not bad. The men at our workplace practice sexism every moment of everyday. The saddest thing is that they don’t realize it. One day, one of my male co-workers was helping my other co-worker describe what I do. My job, according to him is to make documents and to take care of kids. He snickered after the fact, which makes me think that maybe he is aware of his unfair biases. In another moment when my female co-worker and I were in the middle of a project, the same said male co-worker came over, literally took the material we were working on out of our hands and demanded that we package and ship something out. This same male co-worker was hired only 4 short months before me and 2 months before my female co-worker. The three of us have put in equal work, dedication, and time. We all have Bachelor degrees, with high GPAs and spotless resumes. Yet, he gets paid a sizable amount more than we do. With a female co-founder, I thought my efforts would be awarded. Yet, that’s not the case. I am a woman, therefore my compensation is meant to be lower than my male counterpart: that is not right. And frankly, it is disappointing to know that our female co-founder accepts such blatant fundamental sexism. I take a stand today to ensure that I am not mistreated because I am a woman and because stereotypes still to this day dictate how women are treated in the workplace. And I will no longer believe that it is men who are trying to hold my potential back. It is society doing this. It is women who allow sexism into their lives. All women, all people who are made to feel inferior based on any characteristic of their lives, i.e. race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, educational background, economic status, have the right to stand up without fear of judgment. And if judgment is the response, then we know that our world is not yet equal. And equality is the goal, not eternal domination. "

"Working in a factory, surrounded by men of all ages. One would start every morning asking another woman working nearby “So when are you going to get your tits out?”. Others would talk constantly amongst themselves about woman they wanted to have sex with, celebrities and the like. Being asked out of the blue “So when did you give away your wedding china?” – i.e. when did I lose my virginity. Listening as one told a ‘funny’ story of his sister’s rape, all his friends laughing. Another woman complaining about this to the management and basically being told to shut up. And this is just one workplace. "
"I work is a majority female environment where I unfortunately still have to deal with sexism on a day to day basis. The women I work with don’t see the men in our workplace as equals. They see them as people who can lift and carry things for them, despite being more than capable of doing so themselves. I know this seems like quite a trivial thing, but in the context of this workplace, it completely demeans any accomplishment the men make. Trying to promote equality is difficult when every person, whether male or female, has been brought up in an age where each is expected to be a certain way in order to prove their gender. Often I find myself saying to the young men and women in my workplace “there is literally not one thing that he/she can do, that you cannot”. "
"My first round of stories of everyday sexism may seem trivial but they contribute to a culture where women are basically secondary to men: – all “unisex” T-shirts are cut for a man’s body shape. Women are supposed to feel happy in clothing not designed for them but men would be viewed as ridiculous if they wore a top with a waist and hip cut. – the constant use of the “he” as a generic/”neutral” pronoun especially when referring to any generic important person e.g. a doctor, headteacher, company director, banker, lawyer etc. – constant commentary on women’s body shapes in the workplace “she’s put on weight” in a way that does not happen with men. Second round – general attempts to demean of professional/intelligent women: – “Hilary Clinton, well she’s a lezza isn’t she” – Male partner with whom I conducted an interview, responding to a male candidate’s question regarding diversity “well, actually, amongst the associates we have more women than men. It’s a heterosexual man’s dream.” "

"I work within two generally male dominated environments; a pub and an ironmongers/DIY store. A woman working within these two workplaces (regardless of the fact that the DIY store is owned by 2 women) experiences severe ‘casual sexism’ on a day to day basis. To me, sexism is as simple as just recieving a derogatory comment aimed at womens inferiority. This is what I experience the most within these jobs; names such as ‘darling’, ‘sweetheart’, ‘love’, and comments such as ‘there’s a good girl’ are not only experianced once every now and then, but are experienced multiple times on a daily basis. Last week a single (male) customer called me ‘love’ 4 times, ‘darling’ twice and told me I was a ‘good girl’ 3 times. Although many may see these terms as endearing I see them as patronising, seeing women as inferior. The second form of sexism I recieve from customers is expecting a male to serve them. It can be as simple as entering the shop and seeming suprised to see a woman serving them and exclaiming “where are all the men?” to asking to be served by the ‘boss’ or, bluntly, by a male. You can imagine the suprise on the faces of these misogynistic pigs when my FEMALE boss comes through to serve them. Some customers even leave the shop due to the lack of male presence. I would like to make clear that, although 8/10 of our customers are male, this is not just a problem with occurs within the male sex. Plenty of women come in to the shop and ask, assuming that I do not have either the experiance or knowledge to know what I am talking about (dismissing the fact that I have worked here for almost 2 years), to speak to someone who knows what they are talking about. Many just walked past the counter, to the back of the shop, in search of a male collegue. I’m not insinuating that I know everything there is to know about my profession however many people do not give me, or any of the women in the business, a chance to help. Many do not even know themselves that these comment are sexist as they are engrained into our every day living. "

"I used to work in a hotel restaurant as a waitress. On one of my shifts the receptionist came into the restaurant and asked where the male assistant chef was, so he may help some guests with their heavy bags. The assistant chef was not available, so I offered to help. The receptionist was reluctant but I insisted. I went outside to where the guests were waiting with their bags, as soon as they saw me coming the look on their faces dropped, especially the male guest, and they were also reluctant. I insisted yet again and I helped them with their luggage. On returning to the restaurant I entered the kitchen and the head chef immediately asked me “Why did (the receptionist) send you out there when we have three boys here who could have done it?” I didn’t know what to say. This was the first instance of work place sexism that I had experienced, or rather, recognized immediately. Thinking back this sort of thing has happened all the time in my workplaces. I started working when I was 15 and very unaware of things like this. Now that I’m 20 I am able to reflect upon other instances and understand that this is a much too common occurrence. "

I was angered because she didn’t realise how sexist this was in itself. What about the male chefs who want to see their children? Why is it assumed that women must always be the primary caregiver and why do we perpetuate this attitude by schemes like this? No wonder women still feel, even with all the maternity leave and care now, that they must at some point make the decision between a career and a family life. Men at no point have to make this decision. And they suffer as a result too because of the stigma then created around stay-at-home dads. It’s exhausting "

"When someone you hardly know thinks it’s okay to insult your partner to your face one minute (“they have no balls”) then call you “doll/darl” and rub your arm five minutes later. When that same person later sends sexist messages to your partner about you, implying they are a “whipped” man. And finally when they act like nothing has happened and call out “pussy” (how that word is thrown around one minute as a weakness and the next as a desireable ‘thing’…) for not joining in. "

My boss talks constantly about the “loud” women in the office; doesn’t notice the men yelling about sports all the time. #EverydaySexism 
"I have recently become more aware than ever before of the enduring sexism suffered by women. A couple of events contributed: I asked for my workplace coffee stall to replace its complimentary copy of The Sun with another paper. The written reply was to the effect, â€œLighten up… it’s only a bit of fun… etc.â€? I am proud to say that my argument and my offer to escalate my complaint succeeded (more on my pride in point 3 below). Some weeks later I was in the audience of some briefings at work. A succession of men briefed the boss on their progress and were deservedly praised. A woman briefed and was rewarded by, â€œGood girl!â€? from the boss. So sexism exists and it’s pernicious and it shames me. I expect my points have been made before on the site but they’re worth repeating: 1. As far as I can tell, most people (regardless of sex) are decent and respectful. I know you know this, but please don’t think most men would act in the ways described in these posts. I share your revulsion and condemnation of such aggression. 2. Regrettably, I didn’t ‘call’ the â€œGood girlâ€? remark on the spot. I have spent weeks dissecting the reasons why. I didn’t react so as to allow the briefer to answer back for herself; I feared coming across as paternalistic. I don’t think I am justifying a lack of moral courage on my part. In hindsight, I should have spoken out. I am a human being and as such I had a duty to intervene when another human was being wronged in front of me (remember the WW2 poem, â€œFirst they came for the Socialists…â€?). If the boss had used racist language we would certainly all have challenged him. We shouldn’t feel inhibited from challenging sexism. 3. I did later speak to the boss privately and I let the briefer know that she was not alone. There remains a nagging feeling of guilt about this. Was I paternalistic or patronising? Do I have a right to speak out on behalf of women or does my uninvited contribution add to the insult? My view is that I do have such a right, indeed a responsibility, and I’m proud that I acted on my principles. And I can and should feel proud. Again, imagining a similar context but with racist, rather than sexist aggression makes our common duty as people very clear. I am now beginning to take action and become involved in combating sexism. While I previously feared being told that it wasn’t my battle to fight I now acknowledge that it is a battle which we should all fight. Men, like women, have every right to care and to help because sexism, like racism, is an aggression against all of humanity. "

"Yesterday, as a “joke” one of my superiors stated that women went downhill after 30. He also referred to me as “this secretary” on the phone to a colleague. I am not a secretary. I was also yelled at the same morning on my way to my office at 8 am – “Hey gorgeous!” AND leered at on the bus. Sometimes I think I am going to explode with anger over this constant disrespect. "
"Customer just asked for a certain cable type I wasn’t familiar with so I asked a colleague: ‘aye, ask the man.’ @EverydaySexism "
Overheard on the bus: “women lose all sense of professionalism as soon as they show their shoulders in the workplace.” 
There’s a job late at night to clean up after the customers at work and only men get chosen for the job. I don’t see why women can’t do this job. I’d like more hours to make more money but they have never asked a woman to do it. 
"(24 years old) I was leading a theatre workshop for top managers at an insurance company (the firm wanted to test employees’ ability to adapt to new situations, flexibility etc). One of the improvisations I did with the group was called The Question Game, where players can only speak in questions, no statements etc., they must constantly form new questions on the spot – usually mundane things like what did you have for breakfast etc. I played too and during the course of the game was asked two questions by two different men: 1) are you married? 2) have you lost your virginity yet? I was so shocked!!!! The worst thing – no one else reacted or said anything – not even the three women in the group!! It was strange because all the participants (mostly men aged 40-50) had been totally respectful up till then – this question came totally out of the blue!! It put me in a very uncomfortable position and made me feel very small and naive. I reported it to my boss who told the consulting firm who had organised the event – they were totally on my side and will look into the issue. "
I am SO fed up with sexism in my workplace. Things need to change. 
"When I had my first baby I was expected to stay home automatically. Now, 2 kids on and 4 years out of the workforce it is so hard to get a job again; a lot of people ask me in interviews if I have children, or how old they are etc – if the guy stays home he’s a HERO and if he tries to get back into the workplace after a break there are no awkward concerns or assumptions over his ability to do the job "
"I was told by a female coworker that sexism doesn’t exist anymore. In fact she claims she has never experienced it, and doesn’t understand all the fuss about it. Is it denial or ignorarnce? Scary… "
"When I was 17 working in a restaurant there was just me and a male member of staff left to lock up. He cornered me and forced his hands down my trousers without any warning. I told him no and tried to push him away but he was a lot stronger than me. I managed to push him off eventually and finish my shift. He tried this on more than one occasion. When I was 18 I was dating a boy for about 5/6 months. In this time I believe he cheated on me but he also psychologically abused me. At the time I worked in a nightclub on weekends and he used to threaten to break up with me if I went to work. He used to try and control how I dressed for a night out and what I wore for work even though my taste in clothing wasn’t provocative. He used to go missing for 3/4 days at a time on ‘sessions’ which I got shouted at if I even suggested I wasn’t happy about these. He went missing for 3 days but when I went to house party sober for 1 hour he shouted abuse at me and threatened to break up with me. We eventually broke up and now, a year later, he tries to text me to get back together but I am strong enough to realise his promises of change are just empty words. Just in these past few months, I had to quit my job due to sexual harassment. The male manager in my office said very inappropriate comments to me whilst he was drunk on a staff night out. He admitted to looking down my top whilst he was stood over my desk and said that he ‘likes smaller boobs’ and that he didn’t think I needed the breast enlargement operation I had planned. He also said he’d “probably pay Â£1000 to have me.” I suffered in silence for months as I knew the others in the office thought highly of him and I didn’t have any proof that he’d said these comments to me. As a result of this conversation I’d lost all respect for my workplace superior and actually hated going into work. A few months after this incident he inboxed me on Facebook (presumably drunk again) asking if wanted to play a game where we can ask questions and have to answer honestly, he said “play or sleep?” I responded “sleep”. He proceeded to ask: whether I shaved below, if I’d ever had a threesome, if I’d ever had any lesbian experience and if I used a toy or my finger!! I said goodnight and went to sleep as planned. The next working day I got pulled into the office and he basically wanted to assure I hadn’t told anyone about the messages, specifically my sister as she works in the same industry with some of his contacts. I literally had no respect left for this ‘superior’ and dreaded work, as a result my performance had dropped but it wasn’t busy anyway. I stopped wearing make up for work and in the summer I’d gone ahead with my breast enlargement surgery (which he made jokes about, implying I’m a bimbo) but I wore polar neck tops to avoid drawing attention to myself. A few weeks later I got pulled into the office and was issued a warning for a drop in my performance. It was at this point when I realised I couldn’t keep this bottled up, it wasn’t going to just disappear on it’s own if I ignored it for long enough so I told my parents and my sister. I told an older female member of staff who I respected and she gave me the director of the company’s email address. I screenshot the Facebook messages and sent them to him when he requested them. When he came up for a meeting about this issue he was supportive and my line manager also heard about the incident. She shook her head and acted disappointed in the man who harassed me. In the end, the managing director gave the man a slap on the wrist and told him not to do it again, even admitting he was lenient because of how much work the man had done for the company. My line manager (female) seemed to brush off the incident and another female manager from one of the other offices started almost bullying me. She sent a message to me via Facebook with just a ‘thumbs up’ sign but this was her being sarcastic. She started having sly digs at me whenever she was in my office and when I told the director about this he said ‘I’m sure she wasn’t sarcastic I know women are usually supportive of each other with this kind of thing.’ I firmly believe that the manager who harassed me has made me out to be a liar to some of the other women and he’s tried to play the victim! The first female staff member I told has been very supportive throughout the whole ordeal but the other two I am disappointed in. My friends and family have all been great and it’s made me extremely thankful and appreciative for their support. I have now left this company and am currently awaiting a start date for my next employment role. "
"I was hired at a company to be an engineer and to HELP with the development of standard procedures. Not only do I have to prove I know what i’m doing every day but even after that some still ignore me. I’ve also become the owner’s secretary, not officially but that is how i’m treated. He has literally sent me out to get copies of documents made and he has “volunteered” me to go out into the storage area to hunt down documents, didn’t even tell me he had someone else do it. I have not been an engineer in so long, I miss it and I’m really good at it. "
"Almost daily at work– other managers or directors not responding to my inquiries or direction- that would never be the response if it were a male doing the same. One particular manager only being able to refer to me during my pregnancy, “remember when you were expecting?….” “Oh, I remember you when you were pregnant wit your first…” On one occasion I asked a security officer to stop testing alarms on the unit because it was disruptive to patients. He ignored my request. When a male counterpart made the same request, the officer complied. Just 2 examples of MANY encountered regularly. "

"I work for a church that provides a food pantry. Some of the men that come are very inappropriate, saying “Hey sexy” and “damn” and “I’m flirting with you.” I also experience this walking down the street, and riding public transportation. I’ve had men chase me down the street from the BART station to try and give me their phone number. I’ve had male parishioners call my husband “Mr. Pam.” I’ve had male lay leaders question my professional and personal experience, especially if it deals with anything mechanical. When I’ve reprimanded a volunteer for drinking on the job, he said “I don’t have to take this from a woman.” "
"I am a mature woman who has worked all through the 70’s and up to now and am close to retirement age (unless the government decides to put the age up again). I have worked hard and am recognised by colleagues and managers as being very good at my work, which is a professional job with degree and above qualifications. The only gap in my working life was a period of 4 years for motherhood before returning to work. In my career I have been denied promotion in favour of males at every turn – most of my career has been spent in a large public service organisation. The most annoying is the fact that I have trained many new staff and mentored new graduates, mostly males, many of whom have been promoted above me somewhere along the line. I confess to not being particularly ambitious, but I have applied for promotions, which have always been given to a younger male of the pushy masculine “salesman” type of personality, which is apparently what employers want, despite meeting all the essential and desirable criteria and always being told that I was just pipped at the post. These fast tracked young men normally come to me for advice when they struggle with handling the job they have been given. I have watched all of my female colleagues similarly by passed by younger males and none of the female professionals I have worked with have ever climbed their way to the top – the only ones who have achieved some limited promotional success are those with a very bullying, masculine style, who are often used as bulldogs by upper management. There appears to be no respect for any traditional “female” talents and skills – these are seen as weaknesses, not strengths. In my view these attitudes are in no small way responsible for the type of thinking which results in the bankers scandals and the lack of governments response to dealing with such practices. Women in the workplace are not managed by representative samples of people and the Government does not represent the population, leading to a loss of confidence and engagement with the wider population. All the equality legislation and company policies which are in place do not ensure that women are fairly treated in the workplace, or in the home. Jobs are still advertised using a masculine template and masculine language. Sexism is still evident in the language used. Having lived through the modern sexual equality changes, I still do not feel that things have changed sufficiently for women to be truly equal in society. "
"At work, while I’m waiting for the kettle to boil, I’ll do little bits like wipe down the surfaces. I’m also one of the last out so I set off the dishwashers.

"After a particularly bad day at work, I walked down to the office before leaving the school where I teach. My students had been difficult and I sent one to the office. This was mot the students first offence. As I walked by my principals office, she asked me tonstop in. We discussed what had happened. The short meeting went bad to worst, she seemed to bw blaming me for the incident, saying I had not given thw student a warning, saying I had fluctuating emotions. After a while she seemed discouraged and said : “Well I don’t know what to tell you. You just sent him to the office just like that. It’s like you’re PMS-ing or something.” My jaw dropped, I was so surprised by her comment and frustrated with our meeting that I was speechless. I left thw room without a word. I never expected my female boss to say such a thing. "
"I am so angry for my daughter. She was assaulted in her workplace(some would say ‘mild sexual assault’) As we were giving a statement to the police she received a text message from him apologising. He was charged, bailed, and pleaded ‘not guilty’ in our local court-choosing to be tried by jury. At crown court be had maintained his plea and there will now be a 3 day trial in August. My daughter is strong and is determined to stand up against him. I stand by her. "
"The more I think about this, the more I notice. I was giving directions the other day and my male partner butted in and I was completely ignored. A female colleague told me she wasn’t a feminist because they are “all lesbians”. Another female colleague told me she was only employing men in her team as they are “less emotional and won’t get pregnant”! My boss referred to Nicola Sturgeon as “ginger totty”. I have conference calls with male businessmen who refer to me and my female co-worker as “ladies” or “girls” or “love” and never my actual name. I have seen my male colleagues looking up potential female clients on social media and commenting on their physical appearance and whether or not they think they are attractive. The list is never ending but I am shocked at how so little women (or anyone) actually voices their opinion and distaste. I am called “gobby” for objecting. "
"At work my male colleague frequently makes vulgar comments (making references to pornography and sexual references) towards the only other female colleague there, she does not realise that he is making jokes at her expense but everyone else does and I find it really inappropriate in the workplace. This morning he was making comments (so called “jokes”) about a prostitute being raped. I do not think this is appropriate conversation for a school. I rarely have to put up with this kind of thing as most schools have more female staff than male, so I am not used to it. He is always in the staff room, so I avoid it, but cannot always avoid it as there are times we are expected to be in there for morning meetings. What it all adds up to, is that women are expected to either get used to vulgar comments about sexual violence and sexual humiliation, or leave the workplace. I avoid places like pubs, sports events and places where there will be drunken or unpleasant men, but I need to work in order to pay rent and support myself, so I do not have a choice about it. My (male) boss has asked him more than once to stop but he continues. My female colleague does not have the confidence to support me, as she is not as surprised by it. In other cultures I feel that women are treated with more respect and are not expected to imitate men or lower their standards in order to pander to some men’s idea of “humour”. The workplace should not be a hostile place for women, they should not be routinely and intentionally bullied or made to feel uncomfortable there. "
"Working in the field of behavioral management often requires working with clients at their home setting. Two years ago while working with a 5 years old male, his mother approached to speak in regards to her son’s havior and asked her son to leave the room. She then revealed her interest in knowing me personally and if she can touch my hand and kiss me. It was a shocking and uncomfortable experience that I ever had during my professional career. I was respectful of her feelings, shared how I was appreciative of her feelings and managed to redirect the conversation to focus on her son. During the end of our conversation I shared how I appreciated her for being a great mother and parents. Also, I shared how often clients might develop feelings for their providers. After I left the family’s home I felt uncomfortable and moving forward I met with the family in the community. The whole experiance made me think about gender and sexism as an issue that not offten indeptly discussed. For example, the important of raising awarness to stand up to a serious issue facing our society. "
"Some months ago my line manager brought a cake to the office. He asked me to cut the cake because I was the only woman, in front of two male colleagues, that did not react. I answered him that I should contact HR for his comment, and that why didnÂ´t he cut the cake himself. He still tried to give me the knife. I repeated that he could cut it himself, and he proceeded to do so. I decided that unless it happened again, the issue wasnÂ´t worth raising up with his boss or HR. My line manager left the office a month ago. Last week I resigned, and my team leader commented that they have troubles hiring female employees. I told him that this person (who was no longer an employee) had asked me to cut a cake because I was the only woman in the room, and his only reply was to laugh really loud. ItÂ´s not only that I found it quite ironic that he was asking me about reasons why there might not be many women around and had this reaction to my answer, itÂ´s also that I was leaving and the person that had done this had already left. He wasnÂ´t going to have to do anything a part from saying how sorry he was about this happening, and maybe let HR know, but he went for a sexist reaction instead. "
"Had the task of talking to a client about an IT technical matter. Explained I was from the IT department and trying to resolve, and required more information from him. Bloke kept talking about “The IT GUYS will sort it out”. Patiently explained again that this technical problem was what I was trying to sort out, and he did it again. In the end, I said “You do realise that we have a MIXED IT department of both guys AND girls” and he sort of mumbled something, then closed the conversation by repeating “The IT GUYS will sort it out”. FFS it’s hard enough being in a male dominated industry without having to prove that you do actually work in that industry. If a bloke had called this guy, I bet he wouldn’t have had any problems at all. "
"I asked for a pay rise when I found out I was being paid a lot less than similar male colleagues . I thought as I was a good employee the company would be supportive … but all I got was a load of grief. So I left and got another job – ironically at more than the mens’ salary.

"When I was 18, I went for a job interview in a furniture show room. I was asked some initial questions. After this, the manager looked me up and down and produced a uniform that was far too short and tight for me. I had to try it on and then come out and show him and another male employee what I looked like in this ridiculously tight uniform. I felt utterly humiliated. I couldn’t wait to get out of there. "
"I am a woman. I want to become a pilot. I feel sick every time I think of all the sexism that I might be confronted with in the workplace. I am a woman. Society values the way I look, not my intellectual capability. Every time I repeat, repeat, repeat “your value is not in your body”, my attention is still on my body. I can’t escape. I am a woman.

Just the other day one of the men at my office ground his crotch up into my ass and called me his ‘suck-u-tary’ to a customer (play on the word secutary im assuming) not sure if the sexual referencing was worse, or the fact the im a marketing professional and not his receptionist.. it gets you down but keep fighting people x "
"I am a dietitian and quite slim build but I have a good appetite and by no means eat a meticulously healthy diet – I just exercise a lot. I find I constantly have people on the ward mentioning my weight, patients and staff asking me what I weigh and saying things like you must practice what you preach and it’s a good job you’re slim to fit through that gap. I get that I talk about weight and food with patient but I’m not there to talk about me. I’ve even had people ask me if I have an eating disorder. I’m pretty sure if I was a guy no one would even think twice if I was skinny. "

One week, I said hi to him and asked how his week had been, and he responded by pinching my cheek (in front of a room full of work colleagues and other new volunteers) and saying, “There’s that smile I love to see!” I should mention he’s in his 60s, I’m 25, and I’m technically his direct supervisor.

"My brothers never have to do housework. I do. I hate this. It’s so unfair. I am told by my parents that I am a “tomboy”, because I like to climb trees, play outside, make stuff out of wood, and wear pants sometimes instead of skirts. This is not said in complimentary tones. My father informs me that “no woman can ever do a job as well as a man can.” My brother sexually abuses me. This is not right. I tell my mother. Fortunately, he never does it again. I overhear my mother telling my father, “What does she want an education for? She’s only going to get married and have children.” At my very first job interview, my prospective boss tells me, straight up, that he expects me to have dinner with him regularly and that he wants a mistress. Then he asks me to stand up and show him my legs. I flee the premises, shake uncontrollably all the way home on the bus, bawl my eyes out, and down 3 strong vodka and tonics. Some of my dates think that sex should automatically follow if they buy me dinner. My flatemate is terrified of her step-father. She has moved out of home while he’s been working overseas. He has how phoned and told her he’s coming to take her home. He has been sexually abusing her for years. My date attempts to rape me in his car. While on a temp office assignment, my boss tells me he’d hire me full-time except I don’t pass the boob test. My boyfriend asks me, “Why do you want a career? I’ll build you a nice house and you’ll look after our four kids.” Tradies on a construction site wolf-whistle at me. (This happens regularly to young women in the 60’s. I and my friends really hate this.) While a friend and I are leaving a rock concert, the man behind me pinches my behind. (I lay into him with my umbrella. How dare he?) An office colleague comes up behind me and jabs his fingers into my ribs. He never does this to his male colleagues. (He gets a smack and a good talking to for his trouble.) My mother tells me that a family friend tried to sexually molest her when she was in her teens. A man helping me to change a tyre on the side of a country road grabs me and tries to kiss me. (He gets kneed in the groin.) I have learned to change my own flat tyres; in the midst of a tyre-change, a carload of men pull up and offer to help. I thank them for the offer and tell them it’s ok, I can change it myself. They verbally abuse me and drive off with a squeal of tyres. My boyfriend tries to choke me during an argument. (I leave him.) My husband pushes me to the ground during an argument. My head just misses hitting a rock. So many women ask me why I don’t have children. I get a promotion at work. However, I am paid much less than men in the same role. Trying to negotiate a fairer deal just doesn’t work. My brother expects me to pack up and leave my home and my business and my life overseas, and come back to Australia to “look after Mum”. He is unwilling to help her. Apparently, this is the daughter’s job. I notice that most house-cleaners are women, and aren’t paid much, but most window-cleaners are men, and are paid 2-3 times as much. House-cleaning is much harder work (I’ve done both). I charge what I think the job, and my effort and commitment, are worth. If a prospective client is not willing to pay it, I don’t work for them. (You do learn some things along the way…) My ex sister-in-law’s new husband asks me why I don’t get a boyfriend. His other comments make it clear that he thinks I am “still attractive enough” to have no trouble attracting a man. I notice – you can’t help but notice – that there are huge amounts of truly awful online comments made to and about women. Over my lifetime, I’ve heard an incredible number of stories from women of rapes, attempted rapes, family or workplace sexual predation or harrassment, verbal abuse, domestic violence, unfair wage practices, lack of promotions at work. Women of all ages, backgrounds, education. Will this stuff never stop? "

Apparently, a colleague sent this to my boss for easter greetings. He first sent a picture of a bunny and then my boss asked ” no naked one?” and then the guy started to send nudes. This in a business related conversation. I feel so grossed out. This guy is my boss, married and a father. I wish he’d at least deleted those messages from his sent items so no one would have to look at naked private parts while trying to do their work. "
A college and his wife came to work to show their newborn baby. The general manager told me and my female colleague not to look too closely so that we do not get pregnant anytime soon. I had to digest that comment and I didn’t react. Later I approached the manager and told him how inappropriate his comment was. All he did was saying that it was just a joke and he didn’t mean it serious while putting his hand on my shoulder. He did not acknowledge my criticism and furthermore belittle me with his gesture. I once again felt belittled after being brave approaching him. 
"When I was constantly having my ass slapped and groped by a guy at my work, I finally worked up the courage to go to my manager and tell her what had been happening. I told her I was too uncomfortable to confront him myself because he was higher up than me, only to be told she couldn’t do anything unless I spoke to him myself. If it kept going on, only THEN could she talk to him about it. This man is 20 years older than me and an aggressive person so I just let it happen until he eventually got bored and left me alone. For sooo long I felt like it was my fault for not being able to speak up to him.. But they should have when I complained. I hate that women are discouraged from speaking up against workplace harassment because of shit like this. "
"After work one time (I finished at 11pm) I drove home and was followed by 3 guys (In their car) who had been at my workplace just before. They followed me for over 45 minutes and found me no matter how I tried to drive off, eventually I drove to the police station and they drove off. Countless time out in public I have been “complimented” or whistled at, and what’s worse is that even though I’m an adult I have a very slim, young looking “physique” yet still get such comments, it’s disgusting regardless.

"Male boss called me “bitchy” (to my face, in front of other people, and tried to play it off as a joke) in response to feedback I gave him regarding sexist remarks made about other coworkers at a prior meeting. When I tried to explain to him why it was sexist he claimed that he has also called a male coworker bitchy. "

"I work in HR and have to attend employment law updates from time to time. Today, I attended an update in a very prestigious, global law firm in the city. One female Partner was running through her ‘hot topics’ for 2015, one of which was female representation on the boards of not just the FTSE 100 companies, but also on the FTSE 350 companies who were failing to meet soft targets. Upon introducing this subject to the room as one being very close to her heart, two male employees (her co-workers, one of whom is also a Partner) looked at each other smirking and one actually rolled his eyes. Had a male counterpart raised this subject, I wonder whether these colleagues would have reacted in the same way. Equal opportunities for women in the workplace seems to only be taken seriously when a man broaches the subject. "
"Working in an industry dominated by men I am happy to say that on the whole I have experienced very little blatant sexism in the workplace. There were two recent incidents however that have shaken me out of my comfort zone, and made me realize firsthand how important and relevant feminism still is. The most recent was while I was attending a professional conference during a cocktail party. One of the men I had been chatting with tickled me several times, touching me at the waist without my consent, and certainly without any provocation. I brushed it off at the time and ignored him, after all it was a party, everyone was a few drinks in. But thinking about it later just made me queasy, why did he feel that was an ok thing to do, and why didn’t I feel like I could tell him not to without fearing I would be called uptight? The previous incident was a far worse violation, and one that remains unsolved. I came into work one morning to discover someone had accessed my personal email account and downloaded several old personal photos and left them in the downloads folder on my PC. I notified HR and the company went through an investigation but was unable to find concrete evidence of who had done it, which would have enabled them to terminate who was suspected. Left without good evidence for legal recourse I decided to suck it up and finish out my project like I wanted to do. To think that someone I know and work with thought it was ok to do this to me, and bothered to in the first place disgusts me. Thankfully I will be leaving soon. "
"I am 57 years old now, my abuse started at age 5, when my cousin, then 13, began molesting me, getting me to fondle him, him groping me. My mother recently informed me that she knew of this abuse, but was helpless to stop it, in that it would have “upset a lot of people”. Next my uncle pinned me up against a wall repeatedly, telling me to “hush”, while he molested me. I was 12. When I was 20, my own father, drunk over the holiday, French kissed me in a crowded restaurant, I cannot get that horrible picture out of my mind to this day. I come from a very wealthy family, and my Grandfather left me a large inheritance, and my father stole 90% of it from me, and wonders why I won’t “care” for him in his old age now. I spent most of my teenage years dressed in overalls and loose fitting clothing, trying hard to not bring attention to myself, and I was not that attractive, just an average girl, trying not to be a target. It was not until I reached 19, and experienced sex with a boyfriend, did I really understand what these men had been “doing” to me, and it took another 10 years to understand that I was a victim, and should not be held responsible, at age 5, and 11 and 13, for the things men were doing to me. When I was 25, I was in a terrible car accident, when I came home from the hospital, my face was swollen like a pumpkin, two black eyes, stitches up and down my cheeks, left arm in a sling, drugged for the pain. My boyfriend was out and I wake up on the couch to his friends hands up my nightgown, he was smiling. I mean seriously? I looked like Frankenstein, I was drugged to the point of drooling, what about this was attractive? I had to call his wife to come and get him out of my house. I find it interesting that these men, my own family, would defend me against other men, but felt “entitled” to “handle” me themselves. I find it horrifying, that a mother would accept the abuse of her 5 year old daughter, if anyone tried to “handle” my son, I would kill them with my bare hands. I no longer speak to my mother, I feel she did not protect me as a daughter, and so I do not owe her the debt of a daughter in her old age. I’m sorry but I believe men are inherently predatory of women, that weak or helpless triggers a response in them to overpower, pounce, stalk, own, possess, abuse, fuck over. I believe that men understand this about themselves, and acknowledge it to each other. I find that the media portrays a “smart woman” as sexy, intelligent, and is respected if she can be sexy and smart, and use this “weakness” in men against them, they too, are assumed to acknowledge this nature of men. Today, I own my own business, I train horses, I operate heavy machinery, strong young women flock to me in their hopes to understand how to navigate this world, where they are honestly and openly treated as prey. It seems the entire world encourages us to increase every nuance of our desirability and vulnerability. Why is “attractive” “sexy” perceived to be weak, helpless, soft? Is this the appeal of tits and ass? The young women I meet are smart, strong, beautiful, and very confused on how to be those things, and not be eaten alive. Today, I am strong and beautiful, I am sexy and smart, and I am armed. I am very happy with my security system, my guns, my muscles, and my understanding of this world of men. With the young women I meet, I share my nail polish, my hairdresser, I teach them to drive bobcats and tractors, I teach them to flyfish and train horses, and I teach them to grow strong and defend themselves. I teach them to handle tools and I teach them to shoot. I believe that if we really want change, then it must begin with the parents, that Fathers must teach their daughters self respect, and self defense. I see a change coming out there, at least we are talking about it now, we are responding to the need for equality in education, sports, workplace rights, but I also see that we as women are still expected to appeal to men in law, government, all positions of authority, to defend us, to “give” us our rights as humans, and to pass judgement on when or if those rights have been violated. I will take my human rights, I will love the men in my life for who and what they are, and if another man tries to “handle” me without my invitation, I will respond hopefully, appropriately. But I will respond, I am no longer the silent, guilty, shamed, helpless, victim. I think I understand now, that men will take everything from you if you let them, your self respect, your sex, your money, your freedom, your sense of safety, your rights as a human being. I am a human being, I have a right to be here, and I will defend that. "
"Working on an IT project at my new client, I was in a 4-person meeting working through some design issues in having AX2012 control the creation of activities in Salesforce against documentation that was being scrubbed in a 3rd system. One of the guys in the group literally pretended I wasn’t there. Every single sentence, every question, every suggestion I made (and when it comes to design discussions, I do not hesitate to voice my opinions and ideas) was completely ignored, as though it had never happened. It was awkward enough for the other guys to notice and give funny looks, though neither of them did anything. They would, occasionally, if they agreed with me, repeat what I had just said (literally), so that the AX expert would “hear” it. After 4 of these meetings, this expert realized I actually DID know what I was talking about, and would at least hear what I said in in person meetings. However, with every question and every issue I raised for the next 1.5 YEARS on the project he would follow this pattern: 1. Ignore me. 2. Dismiss the issue out of hand as “not an issue” I would then take the time 30-60 minutes to “prove” it was an issue 3. Acknowledge it was happening, but dismiss its importance I would then take the time 3-5 hours usually, to “prove” it was a major issue with data to back me up. 4. Acknowledge it was an issue and important, and finally fix it. In less than 10 minutes. He truly knew his stuff in AX, and everything BUT AX were my areas of expertise. But seriously? EVERY ISSUE he wasted up to 6 hours of my time in making me prove it. And I was wrong about it being a major issue perhaps 1 in 50 issues? He did not act this way with any of the men on the project. Even brand new people who didn’t know what was going on. Eventually the client hired a new person to handle the integration (which I was most heavily involved in) on the AX side. HOLY MACKEREL. He was willing to listen to me, meet with me and work with me! We made more progress together in 2.5 weeks than in the full year with this other guy. "
Someone sent an email to a group dsitribution list at work that started “Gents”. Almost 50% of the people receiving the email are female. 
"I work as a freelance copywriter and got hired to do a project at a bank. I was assigned a visitor’s parking space, a privilege that employees apparantly did not get. During lunch, someone jokingly insinuated I only got the parking space because I am a woman. Furthermore, one of the employeesâ€‹ I had to work with, continuously referred to me as ‘his girlfriend’ when introducing me to other employees. On another occasion, the project manager received an email from an employee about a copywriting request. This personen asked whether ‘his copydoll’ couldn’t write the needed content. The project manager thought this was hilarious and when I told him the next day that I was not amused, he said that it wasn’t meant disrespectfully and that I shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. There were ‘little’ incidents like this every day (not always concerning me but other women). "
"Where do I start? Oh my goodness, in most areas of daily life you will find sexism. I have applied for many jobs in the past, yes many, where I have been told that I would not be able to perform the work because I am female. Bear in mind that my current profession is a heavy mechanical trade, and I have worked in labouring jobs most of my adult life. Now come across the “you only got the job because you are female” attitude. Hasn’t changed in the 22 years I’ve been in the workforce. "
"Today my male colleague explained to me, a female, what it is like for a woman when they have sex for the first time. “It is more intimate for a woman” he says. Why thank you male colleague for explaining to me what sex is like for a woman, for I would never know. "
"Went for a work lunch with two senior colleagues yesterday, one male and one female. Myself and the other female sat facing the male colleague as we both needed to talk directly to him. The waiter turned to the male in my group and said “nice view”. When myself and my female colleague looked to see what was behind us the waiter said (to the male colleague again), “no I mean those two”. What the actual fuck. "
"After 6 years of being sexually harassed, groped, and threatened with violence by a senior member of my company, I finally took the step to escalate it to the CEO. The harasser is the CEO’s best friend, hence my delay. After being initially shocked to hear about what happened, the CEO is now considering whether or not this is a disciplinary offence (our handbook says it’s gross misconduct, but hey). He thinks his friend, the harasser, was only joking and didn’t know I’d take it so seriously. It was all a joke. As for the times he groped me (technically sexual assault), the CEO said his friend was pissed. So that’s all okay then, my bad… Not. "
"I worked in a large manufacturing plant in the main office in the parts department. I frequently had to travel throughout the actual plant and one day I was standing near a rather large, loud employee. I turned to leave and he in front of ppl said I hate to see u go but love to watch u walk away. Normally I’m forced to shrug sexual harassment of as it is a predominantly male workplace and run by someone who comes from a culture where men are considered above women, but the way it was said really made me uncomfortable. I approached our female human resources manager( who happens to be of the same nationality as owner) and was told if I didn’t like it, don’t go in the plant. The man who made the comment was not punished and made another comment days later; shining a flashlight at me asking for a dance. I did not report him again, as I was made to feel as though it was my fault for simply being a woman. I was then sent an email from upper management telling me I was no longer allowed in the plant which I needed to go into to do my job. I was eventually laid off. "
"Where to begin? One year, I went on holidays with my parents, I was fifteen. Sitting by the pool my parents made friends with a couple about their age with a very young son. The husband of the couple seemed really nice, chatted away to him. The next day they joined us at the pool, the husband started to stare at me, up and down, telling my parents and his wife how lovely I was. He really just kept on staring at me in my swimming togs, and he really seemed less less jolly old man and more and more, creepy old man. He joined my parents and I for a drink after dinner and when my mother went to bed, he really over kill telling me I was beautiful and grabbed me by the waist. My Father, immediately stood up and said we were leaving in a super awkward way. I think my father wanted to believe I hadn’t noticed behavior so that’s why he didn’t give out to the man, but either way, what hell did that guy think he was doing? When I was fourteen and babysitting, the kids dad slapped me on the bum and said that my shorts looked like I was wearing underwear. When I was seventeen I worked in a bar and I was cleaning the ladies bathroom as the pub was being cleared out. A man his thirties, who was engaged, who knew my family and who’s little sister was in my year in school, followed me into the bathroom, pushed the door closed behind him and told me how pretty he thought I was and asked me whether I wanted it to get “hot” in the bathroom. He grabbed for me so I backed myself into a cubicle, complete with mop and bucket and locked myself in. A friend from school, a boy, who was also working in the bar came in when he noticed the door closed and dragged the guy away. In that same bar, a married man in his forties, groped me. In that same bar, a man in his sixties, groped me. When I was nineteen, a man in his thirties licked my face and squeezed my upper thigh in a car when I was getting a lift home with his sister. He was a really big man, I am a very small person in general. His hand completely around my thigh he rubbed up towards my crotch. He did this while continuing to speak to his sister (driving) and a neighbor in the front seat about his children. I have seen him many times since and he doesn’t look me in the eye. He acts as though he has never met before, particularly if I am with a brother or someone else he knows. When I was twenty one, and in university I brought friends back to my apartment after a night out. A guy I kind of like fell asleep on the sofa, when I went to bed he came into my room. It was college and common for friends to sleep over male or female. He started to kiss me, I kissed back. Before I knew it, he was on top of me, I kept telling him to stop when he was inside me. I kept saying no. He grunted and rolled off of me when he was done. The next morning I felt so ashamed and hungover. I told my friends but I didn’t report it. My friends, never suggested I reported it, it was a case of “bummer, that’s shit”. He would make it his business to be around me at parties, I would try and get away from him, he would follow me home from uni, he once left himself into my apartment by tailgating, he once grabbed by the belt of my shorts in a pub and shoved me against the wall. My friends would give out to him and shield me while another friend helped usher me safely away. None of us ever thought that this was an unusual situation or even illegal, just college. He told friends that he raped me, in front of me and laughed at me. When I ready about unreported sexual assaults I seem to forget to make the connection. When I was twenty five and working in my first “real” job, making “good” money, I was the only female in an all male department. We were having a Christmas jumper day and I came to work wearing jeans and a Christmas jumper, as everyone else in the office did. My male boss, who I had a lot of respect for, said “what are you wearing?!” when responded that I was wearing a Christmas jumper, he said “Really?, I thought you’d show up wearing a Santa’s little helpers outfit for me” I was just astonished, really what the actual…? When I was twenty six I was out for dinner with my friends, I was standing on the street while one of them used the atm. A drunk guy grabbed me by the wrist and tried to drag me up the dark street adjacent to the street we were on. I pulled my arm away from him, he held on so tight that his nails began to dig into my skin, I successfully freed my arm from his grip and my arm started to bleed. It was infected and gross afterwards and I still have a scar on the inside of my wrist from him. I wonder does he even remember it. The dozens of times a man shoved his hand up my skirt in busy pubs. That time my boyfriends friend told me he wanted to fuck me when he bumped into me alone in the hall at a house party. That time when I was working in a restaurant at twenty three when a guy I knew through friends came in drunk with a group of colleagues. I was walking down the stairs and met him on the landing, he grabbed me by both wrists and tried to kiss me. He kept leaning in and trying to reach my face with his as I tried to wriggle out of his grip. I nearly fell down the stairs trying to get away from him. He is a notoriously “nice” guy apparently. When I was in school, my science teacher used to rub his crotch against the front of our desks, so all the girls used to rub chalk on the desks before he came into class. One day, he rubbed himself against the desks like we knew he would and when he stood away from the desk of my friend and I, he noticed that the front of his trousers was covered in chalk. He glared at my friend and I, immediately he grabbed both of us by the arm and dragged us outside of the class room. He whispered in my friends ear, then mine, that he would be our year head the following year and we wouldn’t be able to get away from him. When I was twenty two and living in New York, I was viewing an apartment when the guy who was subletting it, rubbed his crotch up against my bum, really grinded. I left. I’m now twenty nine, I am an adult with a career. I was at a work lunch and at the end of it I turned around to grab my bag and a man at the next table put his hands on the back of my neck and shoulders. I turned around and asked him what he was doing, and whether he thought it was okay to touch other people, strangers, and what was it about me that he thought I would be okay with it, I told him to keep his hands off of me. His lunch mate told me it was a joke, honey. I said he needs to get a better sense of humor and left the restaurant. I was recently heading a project in work and I had to meet a rep from another company, a man, renowned professionally. His openly line was to tell me how cute I was. He also complimented my hands and asked me did I know why men love small hands on a woman. In school, we would have free classes where we would go to a classroom to study and be supervised by a teacher. For my final year in school we had our free class on Wednesdays scheduled in the TG class. The male teacher would always make me sit at the desk directly in front of him. At the beginning I thought it was because I was one of the last in, or because I had a habit of talking to my friends instead of studying. But as time went on, I realised even when I kept quiet and didn’t take my eyes away from the pages of my notebooks, that he would still make me sit there. Or when I realised that when other people were talking, he would make me sit there but not them. He would make me sit there and he would stare at me, I can still feel his eyes staring at me when I tried to keep my focus and avoid eye contact with him by staring at my books. I would always from then on be one of the first rather than one of the last to arrive to class but he would still make me sit there. Boys and girls in the class noticed it and offer to help me avoid being sat there, completely unsolicited. One day, I arrived early, sat in the middle of the class, not the back, stayed quiet, and hoped that he would see no reason to have to move me to the top of the class. But nevertheless when the bell rang for class to start he ordered the person sitting in front of him to switch seats with me. I protested that I was doing nothing wrong and that I shouldn’t have to sit up there because I was early, I wasn’t chatting and I was studying. He ordered me again and again I protested, the rest of the class started to back me up. He let out a roar that we were to switch seats and everyone was terrified, including me, so I switched seats and he stared at me again, for the entire class. That lasted for the entire school year. A colleague of mine said that I was good at the filing because I was a woman. He said that I was good at the fluffy “people management” stuff because I was a women. He said that I received special recognition award and an extra bonus at Christmas, because the company had to give it to a woman. He also says I’m cute like a puppy. There’s more I’m sure. My friends too, there must be hundreds of these stories between us. I hope my boyfriend, my father, my brothers, my uncles, my cousins or friends have ever inflicted this kind of harassment on a women, but it’s so common, it’s so normal that the odds don’t seem in favor.

"I deliver a foreign language to primary school children in addition to being a full time secondary teacher. Today there was a cover teacher in the room with me as I delivered the lesson as usual. He stopped me mid explanation to address the children saying ‘sometimes the words come in the wrong order in a foreign language’, took it upon himself to micro-manage the class’ behaviour, and at the end of my regularly timed slot told me the lesson was too short. I am an experienced teacher who speaks six languages, but I am also a woman. "
"In the summer I work a labor job shovelling and raking, working the same jobs as all the boys. The workplace is primarily men, with one full time woman worker and 3 female students. One day when we were shovelling asphalt with three on the crew I was told to stand there and look pretty. Because clearly that was all they thought I was capable of. That same day as I decided I did not want to just stand there and look pretty and took a shovel and began working. The crew supervisor then began making fun of the man who decided to let me work, saying ” your going to let the girl do the job in public. Your going to make the women work” making fun of the fact that he thought equality was actually something worth trying for. This is only one of the many sexist encounters in the labor field I’ve experienced. "
My boss told me off for not smiling enough. 
"I work in a national park visitor centre where I advise customers on hiking trails in the area. Travellers often come in as couples and it is incredibly common for the man to come up to me and ask various questions that make *his* goals very clear, while his female partner hangs around silently behind him looking resigned to the fact that they will do whatever *he* wants to do, regardless of what she would like. I will always make a point to ask her what she would like to do. It’s somewhat sad to see how surprised and grateful many women seem for this small amount of consideration and courtesy (that their partner can’t be bothered giving to them, apparently). As it turns out, more often than not, women have clear opinions too (surprise surprise!) – they know what they want and don’t want to do. It’s just that their partner doesn’t bother asking them – or if they ask and get an answer they don’t like (such as “I’d rather not do this long hard trail you want to do because I don’t feel as fit and confident as you” or “I have concerns about the weather and would rather wait for it to get better” for instance), they simply ignore it and drag the woman along regardless. The implication is always very clear and always the same: what he wants is more important than what she wants, every time. "
"At a leading UK gardening charity, there is a system of using on-screen ‘welcome’ messages that pop up when you log on to your computer. Today’s message featured a photo of three young women colleagues dressed as fairies in flowery outfits, promoting awareness internally of one of the charity’s forthcoming flower shows. Not the most egregious example of sexism we have ever come across, of course, but quite a shockingly unthoughtful piece of sexism – still using demeaning images of attractive young women to sell and generate interest – by a respected organisation. "
I was at work one day when I clumsily walked past a corner of a desk and banged my hip against it. It hurt like hell and my first reaction was to let out a swear word. An older male colleague stood up and reminded me that it was very unladylike to swear. I rolled my eyes and he told me that was also unladylike. 
"I work in a service station in a small town in Ireland. One of my duties is keeping the shop clean and tidy which includes sweeping the floor.

The implication being that I’ll make a great house wife and I’ll be good at keeping his house clean for him. While its mostly older men who use the phrase, it’s been said to me by women as well. I find it most irritating when women say it. I also have a regular customer, male, who finishes every request with ‘like a good woman’. He’s a nice man and I know he doesn’t mean to offend or patronise when he says it, but it offends and belittles me. Every. Time. "

This statement coming from the captain, not the volunteers. If this is acceptable behaviour in the eyes of the leader of that station, none of the volunteers will question or be required to change their behaviour. And this within a voluntary body. They’re missing out on medical skills, soft-skills, technical and practical skills that women bring to a crew. I didn’t hear back from him. "

"60+ years of casual sexism – and back in the 70s it wasn’t even recognised – bottom pinching, wolf whistling, job discrimination all treated as norm and any complaint or retaliation was regarded as bad tempered and intolerant. Jab the bottom pincher with your elbow and be told “You didn’t have to do that!” At work I was once handed an envelope (relating to a court case) marked “Male eyes only”. Naturally I opened it: it was a photograph of the victim in the murder case that I was dealing with – critical evidence in fact. But here’s a recent example. A friend saw me leaving the library with a novel by Bernard Cornwell. His comment? “What are you doing with that? It’s a man’s book!” "

"I was just today fondly (not!) remembering an all-too familiar experience from my days working in a large organisation. You might have experienced something similar. While in a meeting, you make a (brilliant) suggestion, which is met by an awkward silence, and then a resumption of conversation as if you never said anything. Then, after a moment or two has passed, someone else (invariably male) makes EXACTLY the same suggestion you yourself made only minutes prior. But now, the group is ready to *hear* it, and they congratuate him on his creativity/perspicacity/cleverness and incorporate said idea into their plans. Woe betide you if you say, “but I just suggested that 5 minutes ago!” Because then you are *petty,* *not a team player* and *egotistical.* In fact, you’re just imagining you even suggested that idea because, ah, well you’re just not that bright…. ã€€ I also recall the open surprise of some colleagues when they read pieces of my work, and – get this – they asked if my husband had helped me to write it. Because, you know, I’m just not that bright…. Long story short, I was bullied out of my job by such men as these, and some of the experiences I had on the way were so painful even today, 17 years after leaving that place, that I really don’t want to write them here. I had a fairly specialized job, and living in a small country, I was never able to get another one like it. So it destroyed my career. It also destroyed my health, and I still need medication for a handful of stress-related conditions that developed over my time at this job. I have tried to pick up the pieces, retrain and look for other work, but I remain unemployed (and unemployable). "

"I work as an ecommerce buyer, but my workplace is situated on a busy industrial estate. On my short lunch break I like to go for a walk around the estate. I have stopped going out on the days where I am wearing skirts, because invariably the lorry drivers beep their horns at me. It’s loud and makes me jump. They have no idea how trapped I feel when I am too intimidated to go outside. "
"I’ve been looking for a job for the past two weeks, and my mother has ruled out a few places, such as a supermarket at which I would be a bagger and get shopping carts form the parking lot. She said it’s too dangerous because theres a bus stop very near the store and she’s afraid I would get assaulted. In her own words, “You’re too pretty to work there.” Isn’t it sad that I have to be so afraid for my safety that I am deprived of a job opportunity? "
"I work in a city in the heart of America and I see sexism in my work place. The men and women in my office often infantilize women and refer to them as “girls.” Moreover, my female boss keeps referring to me and my colleagues (half of whom are females) as “you guys.” I have tried to draw people’s attention to this type of language and they just chuckle to themselves. This type of sexism really dismays me to the point that I feel like quitting my job. "
"When I was working in a call centre I tried to be friends with everyone (it was my first job and thought I needed to). For the most part everyone was kind and helpful, except two people. One of them started the exact day as I did and you know newbies stick together. About seven months down the track I just happened to walk by when he said my name. When I turned to look at him, he wasn’t talking to me but one of his male coworkers. He told this coworker that all I needed was a good f**king. The second person turned into a stalker merely because I didn’t want to date him. I was only 19 and he was 30. "

"We just bought a house in a busy little suburb of Miami. An older neighborhood very central to work and school. On our first weekend there, on a Saturday afternoon as my husband worked, my girls and I were cleaning and organizing. A salesman for a security alarm company came by and started pitching his deal. As i listened politely, he asks “is there a husband?” He was shocked that I asked “is there a discount if I have a husband?” And he proceeded to ensure me that my husband would really want to know more. So, I told him that my husband would learn of his pitch if I thought it worthwhile to mention. He regrouped, and then had the audacity to ask “can I come in?” “Why?” I asked. “To count your windows and doors. I need to have an accurate count.” I responded by saying, “well, if we want your service you’ll get the count. I count as high as 20 so we should be good.” He did not understand my joke. And so, proceeded to INFRONT of me out a sticker with his business card on my front door.”Sir, you can hand me that.” His response “i just want to make sure your husband sees it.” I obviously took it down while he was there. I go through all the setail because the curios thing was that my daughters heard the while exchange. Ages 7 and 9, they immediately snickered when I mentioned if there was a discount and when I closed the door my oldest said “why didn’t he want to talk to you? Papi isn’t even here now.” This next generation expects much more equlity from the world than even mine does, and I love it. At her age, I don’t think I would have said anything. And while I’ve worked on human rights issues my whole life, standing up for yourself takes practice and a conscious realization that abuse happens to you too not just the cases u hear about. As my career progressed and I encountered a hanfdul of bosses that either kept me from opportunities, kept my pay low, or dismissed me as opposed to male counterparts, I’ve learned to say something at the onset. I would tell my mother about these incidents and she would be floored. Like the boss who wanted to deny me a promotion because “You have kids and what will happen when they get sick?” My response “I have a husband and a great family, and we work thigs out. They are the inly ones that need to be concerned about my children’s health thank you.” I would tell my mom “that damn decency you showed us makes u hesitate before calling someone out.” And she told me “there’s nothing indecent about standing up for yourself.” My mother, through me, realized that women of her generation tolerated much unnecessarily and that mine and My daughters’ would have to learn how to be “assertive while respectful.” I’m glad my girls noticed something was up with the salesman at an early age. I’m glad that they expect and demand much more. "
"One of my first experiences with sexism came while attending a prestigious, Catholic university. On a first date, a fellow student, angry with me that I would not go any further than kissing, told me he should rape me and I would probably enjoy it. After insisting he take me home immediately, he still did not understand what he had done wrong and continued to try to phone me for a couple of weeks. My next real challenge with sexism came at my first job out of college. I worked for a small investment firm at the Board of Trade. The firm was dominated by young men, including very intelligent men from top math universities. I was the only woman in a year long internship program with 5 men. The harassment started on day 1. Perhaps seeing my isolation and vulnerability, they were like a gang, taking turns making disgusting statements to me, joking about me, making fake come ons for laughs, grabbing or touching me and calling me a vulgar nickname. It was constant and observed by the bosses at the company. It even occurred in public in front of other people, in the elevator and on the floor of the exchange. No one stopped it or even acknowledged that it was out of line. Everyone thought the harrassment was funny. I stuck it out to finish my internship, but left as soon as it was over to get a different job. I realized that the culture at the firm would never change, and I refused to work there any longer. The sexism I encountered at a later job as a flight attendant was different, but began on day 1 as well. In training we were given makeovers and subjected to weigh ins. People who went over their weight limit were asked to leave the program. On the job, we were hit on by male passengers and sometimes pilots, as if the fact that we were in a flight attendant uniform meant that we were available for dates, etc instead of doing our job. Since then, I have seen and dealt with every day sexism all around me in different ways. I have had men follow me on the El, catcall at me on the street and even expose themselves to me in a public place. But the saddest part is that my daughters are still dealing with it, too. "
"My husband and myself run two separate businesses. We’re directors of both and we both make decisions equally when it comes to work. On an almost daily basis we will get cold calls, from either saving costs on our telephone line, printing costs or sending money abroad. It gets a bit annoying but we know people are just making a living and we politely decline. My absolute pet hate is when I answer the phone, to these calls, and nearly every person will assume, I’m the receptionist. My husband never receives the same treatment I do. Cold callers will 9 times out of 10 assume he is the ‘boss’ and the person they need to talk to. On one notable occasion, I actually had the cold caller (who was male) ask me if they could speak to the ‘person in charge’. My response? “You’re speaking to her.” Oddly enough, I wasn’t that interested in listening to whatever he was trying to sell. "
"Hi! I am seventy years old so I have come across many occasions in which I was sexually assaulted – verbally, physically and in the work place. I was astounded initially when I found that I was being “managed” as a female professional accountant. One of my employers was asking clients if they would mind having a female accountant. A client did not trust my judgement and was speaking to my employer and confirming that everything I was telling him was correct. A fellow male accountant was talking behind my back to my employer running me down and my employer never came to me to request my response. I found this out much later. Male voices carry more weight. Male clients would undermine me in subtle ways. My employers felt that a “family man” who had a wife and two children and was years younger and no experience or similar education should make more money as I had a husband who worked, therefore I should subsidize their business. Women always made less money at this progressive male chartered accountancy office. My husband always accused me of “running around” when I attended end of tax season dinner with colleagues. The spouse felt that every dollar he made above mine was his to spend however he wanted instead of lightning my load of our financial expenditures. Many men felt it was alright to make statements such as “the accountancy fee could be taken out on trade,” or said something about my appearance. At home all inside work was mine such as housework and children which was not an equal share of the burden. The spouse would take vacations for sporting and use any extra money solely for his “wants” (boats, motors, new vehicles” while I drove very old small vehicles. Later on when I was bedridden, the spouse sexually assaulted me repeatedly apparently he felt he had that right. This sexism is in every part of women’s lives. My daughter at age twelve was sexually assaulted by a family member. My Mother was told what to do and never had any money of her own. She had no pleasures to call her own in her life. Women are held back at every point by any male they come in contact with. But there is hope. The younger generation are acting as if both sexes are equal. I have hope yet for this new generation here in Canada. But the world at large does not provide much hope. Just looking at the USA Congress and Senate making laws that effect women such as abortion without one female representative. These males think this is their right to force women who become pregnant by males to carry a child and have the burden of raising that child ensuring the basic needs such as food, home, health care etc. while the male has no equal responsibility by law – the woman’s body is to be controlled and regulated.

"I was one of very few females working as a Sales Engineer at a large technology company covering large accounts, and was in line for a promotion. My boss called me into his office one day to let me know that I was being taken off of my most challenging high profile account without a replacement, despite the fact that the client had recently sung my praises. When I pressed my boss for a reason, he let me know that it was because my (male) colleague needed a higher profile account to justify his upcoming promotion. When I pushed back on this change, my boss dinged me in my upcoming performance review, stating that I needed to be more altruistic. "
"I attended a prominent film school that was open about trying to admit an equal number of men and women into the program, hoping to promote women in a heavily male-dominated field. About halfway through my first year at the school I was having beers with some of the people – men and women – I’d gotten to know and work with over the last six months. One of the guys insisted that because less women apply, but that the school still admits 50% women, this means that the women at the school are objectively less talented and less qualified applicants than the men. His argument was that many men more deserving were overlooked in favor of women to satisfy the 50-50 representation at the school. This was someone who I thought was a decent person, who had gotten to know and work with women who were his peers in the program, casually stating that he believed the women were less talented and deserving, like he was remarking that the sky was blue.

"Working as a business consultant there were times when I was the only woman in the room. For a construction industry client I had to work with a team of 25 men in Central America. 25 men and me. Everytime when we were in less formal settings they used to make sexist and sexual jokes. It was so awkward. This guys sometimes were 60 years old or more, and I was 26, and it was supposed to be “ok” to tell sexist stories during dinner (work dinner- please notice): stories about how hot a secretary was, how well equipped she was, or how this saleswoman at one of the stores wanted to “get some” or if a female manager was a total bitch and hated men. They did this in front of me, all the time. They thought it was completely normal and funny. But it was so uncomfortable. At first I was unsure as to what I was supposed to do. Should I ignore it? Should I laugh as well? Should I say something like “this is so inappropriate”? It was really awkward already since I was the only woman but I wanted to “get along” with them. But it just wasn’t possible. It was infuriating the way they spoke about women all the time. And at the same time I knew they just didn’t notice how wrong it was. After the first weeks I made it a point to just stare down the guy that told the joke and make sure he noticed I was not laughing and I was completely serious. So when someone made a joke instead of laughing I just stared at him… for a looooong time, completely silently. It was weird and exhausting because really, who wants to do this while having dinner? It worked a little bit… first when they noticed my stare they would stop laughing and seemed to wonder what the hell was wrong with me and sometimes they sorta noticed maybe what they said was not ok and started to think why I would have a problem with it. However, this was actually too subtle for most. When it was really bad I used sarcasm to thank them for such a lovely dinner conversation, and for sharing how hot my colleagues were and how great it was to know they appreciated them, since they were all sooo handsome, successful and incredible men, and surely all this women were glad to be considered attractive and desireable. I smiled all the while but they did get the sarcasm. Also sometimes I mocked them, “yes, please do tell me more about that saleswoman Rodolfo, it’s funny as hell to hear how she is not interested at all in you”. After several times they sorta made the effort, but I could tell it was really awkward for them as well. Sometimes when they slipped I used the loooong stare and silent face. Once I told them I wasn’t going to laugh at their sexist jokes as a black person wouldn’t laugh at racist jokes. Overall it was a completely exhausting experience. "
"We recently bought a house, which meant dealing with four middle-aged white men all at once: estate agent, mortgage broker, solicitor, and accountant. I had to work ridiculously hard to convince each of them to deal with me directly, instead of deferring to my husband. Worst bit was this conversation with the accountant: Him: “Well, obviously your income will decrease substantially soon so you need to factor that in.” (I’m 35 and earn more than my husband) Me: “Actually, my workplace has good maternity leave and my husband will be do most of the childcare, IF we decide to have kids.” *Awkward silence* "
"Whilst in school, in years 8-10, I was sexually harassed on an almost daily basis by boys in my year. It could be name calling, which I could shrug off, but I’d still be scared of being around that guy. Worse, boys would grab my breasts and bum and the guys around them would laugh. It was a form of bullying. I hated it so much, it made me scared to go to school. It made me feel dirty and made me hate myself. I thought if I made myself ugly, they’d not want to touch me and it would stop. I let the guys know I didn’t like it. I’d tell them to get off me and I’d kick them in the shin.I told my Mum and she said it was boys being boys and they’d grow out of it. I didn’t report it because teachers (including female teachers) saw and did nothing, except give a disapproving look, so I didn’t report it because I thought no one would care. I was embarrassed and thought they’d tell me to grow up and get over it. And I couldn’t imagine telling my male headteacher that these boys were bullying and scaring me in such a sexual way. It was so embarrassing! I suspected at the time it was sexual harassment, but I thought I was being over-dramatic. Now, I know what it was and I can’t believe it was allowed to happen in a school.The worst time was when they cornered me in an empty corridor, took my bag so I couldn’t leave, and started groping me. I was so scared. Sometimes I was scared they’d rape me. It happened to other girls, but not as bad. Other girls would get the occasional slap on the bum, and they’d either ignore it or laugh. I think it was worse for me because I reacted to it and fought them off. In a workplace, this would not have been accepted. Why was this ok in a school? It doesn’t matter if they were teenagers with hormones, it wasn’t acceptable. It made me scared to go to school and this is not ok. We need better sex education, not just covering how sex works and using contraception, but we need to teach kids about consent and sexual bullying. It occurs to me that these boys may not have even known it was wrong, they saw each other and people on tv doing it and thought it was what guys did, perhaps. What happened in school still scars me and I’m sometimes scared to go out in public for fear of a guy looking at me. This could have been stopped with better sex education or better training for teachers on how to deal with sexual bullying. "
"I used to work at a local diner. There was one customer who came in early- 6am. So it was me and only two other workers there at that time. At first he was pleasant and I didn’t feel uncomfortable but he slowly started getting more demanding and asking really personal questions. Where I lived, when I got off work, my number (which he got). Then he called me over to his table and asked me to look at pictures of his hat and tell him which was my favorite. When he turned the phone to me it was mostly pictures of boobs. After that I completely ignored him but I was so worried he would come to my house and hurt me that I had a panic attack later that day. He’s the reason I quit that job. "

"So many things over the past few months, I’ve decided to try and list them: -Boss telling all the men not to swear as there is a lady in the room (me) and not batting an eyelid when a male colleague refers to women as ‘goldiggers’. If you are trying to be chivalrous (a pretty outdated concept -politeness to both women and men is all that is necessary) at least be consistent about it! -Female colleague told me that she views women in the workplace as bitchy and prefers working with just men. Yes, some women are bitchy, as are men! -Friend of a friend that I have just met saying he would love to come to all of my birthdays during my twenties until I turn 30, by which time he will no longer want to go to any of my birthdays. So once I turn 30, I am no longer of ‘value’ nevermind how fun my birthdays will be, regardless of the age I am turning! -Men thinking its okay to stare at me while they walk past me, whilst also physically moving closer to me, nevermind how intimidating I find it. No, it is not okay. -Boss telling me that I will definitely change my mind as all women do this. Pointed out that my dad changes his mind all the time, so I must have got it from him! -Male colleague telling me, when I stated that I am not sure I want to have kids in the future, that I am young and I will change my mind as I get older and my body clock kicks in. Classic example of a male thinking he knows women’s minds and bodies better than women do. -Unknown man in a crowd grabbing my breast as I was walking behind my mother. The first time I had ever been touched sexually. I was 15. Thank you for giving us this portal to share our experiences, just realising that all this stuff is not normal gives us the strength to fight back! Very proud to be a woman and of my fellow women. "
"I was at the office Christmas Party. My boss tried to make me drink shots – I don’t drink very much and repeatedly declined. We went to the after party at a colleague’s house where he repeatedly asked me to have sex with him, and when I say repeatedly I mean constantly for hours. I told him no repeatedly and lost count after 50 nos. He then followed me home and wanted to stay over, I told him no which upset him and I said goodbye and closed the door. He rung the doorbell and wanted to come in almost waking my elderly landlord who lived in the same house which would have caused problems for me. I finally put him in a taxi and sent him home. This really upset me not only because his heavily pregnant wife was a good friend of mine but also because I thought that we were really good friends and I felt that this was a total betrayal of our friendship. Not to mention that he was my boss. And oh none of the men in the group did anything to stop it. So that sucked too. I felt alone and invisible – I mean seriously what do I have to do to get a guy to understand that no means no, kick him in the nuts? I don’t like being physically violent and never have but sometimes I feel like its what I’m going to be forced to do just to get the no across because some men just don’t listen or don’t care about you at all. They just want what they want and you are irrelevant – a thing, not a human being. "

"My husband and I are building a new house. We are involved in a lot of the project management and I often have to meet the tradespeople to discuss what we want done. I designed the layout of the house, am in charge of a lot of the decisions about finishing touches and am doing a lot of jobs myself, such as tiling, painting, staining wood and wallpapering. The man who came to measure the concrete patio job was negative and argumentative about every detail I described, and he was obstructive, and seemed generally amused that a woman was telling him what to do. He kept suggesting other options, selling more expensive ideas and putting down what I suggested. Then my husband talked to him on the phone and he said the guy told him it would look awesome the way we were planning it, that he was looking forward to doing the job and that the ideas were great. He never said anything negative at all. This is not the first time I have found this disparity between the way we are treated. I have tried being more macho, aggressive, bossy, but it doesn’t help and I don’t like being that way, it isn’t how I would want to be spoken to so I’m not comfortable being that way. Sometimes I want to stop them and ask, “If I were my husband standing here would you have said that?” "
"One day at work I pulled a muscle in my back while I was trying to move something. I asked my male coworker if he had some I ibuprofen or something because it was hard to move without pain and I wanted to continue working. He said he didn’t, and went on to speculate by saying “make it’s that lady time for you”. Are you serious, dude! Contrary to popular belief, women are human beings who suffer from aches and pains, just like men, and the big newsflash here is that most of those pains are unrelated to our periods. I stood there speechless, in disbelief. I really wanted to speak out and say something here or mention it to my manager, but I knew it wouldn’t be taken seriously. In spite of this, I ended up telling the manager, who happens to be male…..and guess what? He cracked up, like it was the funiest thing he’d ever heard. He said he would talk to the culprit. I highly doubt if he did, or if so, if it did any good, or worse yet, if it made the guy mad enough to take it out on me. Later I found out from another coworker that the same guy had told him that he didn’t like me, that there was just something about me that he couldn’t explain. I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess why….maybe because I’m female? It’s more than a little insulting. "

"I have a job that requires me to be assertive, to lead a difficult situation, to ensure all that should be done is done quickly and efficiently. I’m a paramedic. One particular time at work a man was interfering with the treatment and handling of my patient. After several times of me politely asking him to stop i had to ask him, quite firmly, to step back so I could assess my patient. After we had got our patient stable and on the ambulance I thanked him for his initial assistance and apologised (for some reason!) for having to ask him to step back. He replied “oh it’s alright love. You were a bit bossy though”. I’ve heard this word all my life. Bossy. Boys growing up were never called bossy when they took charge of games or sports. Men I know in business and in this career aren’t called bossy, they are admired. I’m frankly sick of hearing it. I’m the one who says you can touch my patient or not. That doesn’t make me bossy. It makes me the boss of that situation. It’s my job. It’s why I’m employed to do it. "

"A group of inoffensive Labour-voting educated folk and I were chatting at the weekend and the subject of sexual harassment in the workplace came up. I recounted my experiences as a nurse in the NHS since the 1980s and went on to describe my male Manager who thought that a kiss and a grope with his female colleagues was his right. My husband asked why my colleagues and I didn’t take action against this man? Wasn’t there a Law in place to prevent this? I tried to explain to him the culture of a small town hospital in the 1980s; I made no complaint as I felt that to do so would sabotage my career prospects. At that time the male candidate would always be favoured in the interview process as he was ‘the breadwinner with a family to support’. Despite the fact that men represented around 10-20% of the student nurse intake men were hugely over-represented at management level. We once discussed this with the afore-mentioned Mr kisser-and-groper and he responded that a bloke wouldn’t go off sick if his toddler had been up all night with earache. So much ancient history………… My friend’s husband (a senior manager with a multinational corporation) recounted a recent incident where a female employee in his largely male workforce made an allegation of sexual harassment against the guy nobody liked; my husband thought that the other blokes had put her up to it to try to get rid of the unpopular man. Through gritted teeth I explained to him that no woman would go through the unpleasant process of alleging sexual harassment unless she had experienced it! I despair! I have debated, campaigned and marched for equal rights for women since the late 1970s. A figure currently bandied about in the media is that truly equal pay will happen around 2067. Women, sisters, mothers, daughters, please don’t give up the fight. We have a long way to go. "
"It is a story of my female friends being sexually harassed constantly on a daily basis in a hospital in Karachi. This one day my friend was really upset with something after ward rotation. Upon insisting to much asking what happened, she opened up a bit revealing that someone in ward just passed sexist remarks on her. She never told me what they were. Upon my asking what she said or did in response, her reply was what can you do. And my advice ranged from angry stare to slaps on his face. But not complete silence because in my opinion being a male it is your silence that encourages us to pass more remarks thinking that you some how liked it and now i am cool in your mind. Whatever situation you are in from a drunk male sitting besides you in a public bus passing remarks to a salesman ignoring you and attentive to your male partner, speak-up. Silence in these situations is tentamount to a pigeon closing her eyes upon seeingâ€‹ cat on her head thinking they it will go away. It won’t but you will into his stomach. "

My partner didn’t fancy changing his name either when we got married, but (suprise suprise) no one has ever even asked him if he would be taking my name. "
At a board meeting (I was a director) our head of sales asked me to make a note ‘we should always give women a written warning in their first three months at work. That way when they get pregnant it will be easier to fire them.’ 
"I am 50, with a degree in Electrical Engineeringâ€‹and a Master’s in Computer science. I am smart and articulate and direct, why dont I rule the world? Because I have breasts, younger generation, keep fighting. "
"I’m the only woman who works in my office, which isn’t a problem – I expect to treat everyone the same and expect the same from them. But while I’m typing this all the men are taking the opportunity to look up porn while the boss is out on a conference call. They’re commenting on the women in the pictures while I’m sat here trying to get on with my work. How is this acceptable in the workplace? "
"Despite the brave women that have laid their lives on the line for women’s rights, it is still a man’s world. Like many of the women who responded to the article: ‘When â€˜hello darlingâ€™ turns violent’, in the Guardian, I have experience crude comments in the street when I didn’t respond to wolf whistles. Although I ignored them, I too found it utterly demeaning. It’s not just in the street where men get away with sexism – it happens on a daily basis in the workplace. Managers (men of course) at my place of work constantly get my goat when they make statements like: “We need lots of ladies to go to the exhibition to attract the men, oh and they should all wear skirts too.” My response to this in the past has been to keep quiet, having thought in my mind: “Why don’t you put a skirt on you stupid burk.” I suppose I have been too weak by keeping quiet when such issues arise, but I feel scared that if I stand up to their remarks they will make my position untenable. I still think we have a long way to go in society for there to be equal rights for men and, and I would welcome the opportunity to support your future campaigns. "
"1. I was interviewing people for a role reporting to me. Our organisation’s recruitment policy was that you needed three people on the panel – and in this instance the other two people were men. Despite me doing the introductions and explaining that I headed up the team, most candidates directed their answers to the men. 2. My boss (who was about 30 years older than me) asked me a question across two rows of desks. When I responded he said “I can’t concentrate, your lips are too red” I felt uncomfortable, everyone else clearly felt it was inappropriate, but none of us said anything. It was just left to pass. 3. Took over a project from someone who wasn’t coping with the role. My new boss was describing some of the issues and finished off his assessment of her by criticizing her weight and appearance – he said, ‘i know she makes an effort but seriously, she’s trying to wear lipstick and it’s like putting lipstick on a pig.’ He then laughed and expected me to join in. "
"One of the five directors at my organization (all of whom are male) said to me “Jo – I don’t know if it’s the way you dress or the way you walk, but it always seems like you’ve got something to prove.” I couldn’t imagine a male ever being critiqued in the workplace for his fashion sense or style of walking… "
"I don’t really have a story that highlights sexism. I mean, I’m sure I’ve witnessed it or even unwittingly been guilty of it. Probably many, many times. I just don’t remember it being a factor in my life. I admit that as I’m an educated thirty-something white male with a well paid job, in an affluent country, I’m very lucky to be able to attach that description to myself. Really what I’m trying to say is sorry. Sorry that prejudices which blatantly DO exist aren’t noticed by a regular guy like myself (and I’m not just applying this to sexism but in this context I guess it’s the one that matters). It’s insidious and horrible that anyone might have been conditioned to the point that any inequality is simply unnoticed. But what I’m mostly sorry for is the reaction of males who fear relinquishing their traditional position of privilege. For all of the snarky, snide, condescending comments and the outright hatred and impotent rage that some of them display. For the cowardly threats hidden behind online personas. For the devaluing of a woman’s opinion just because some tool thinks he’s allowed to because he HAS a tool. For every time a guy thought he could just reach out and touch something or someone he wanted without that feeling being reciprocated, and what’s more, those actions invited. You don’t need my words to validate what you’re doing here, but please allow me to be proud of what you’re doing as a fellow human being, because you got me to think a little bit more today than I usually do. Today I noticed something I had not. Today, your actions changed who I am. Maybe just a little, but they changed me nonetheless. Thank you. "
"As a trainee solicitor in the city of London I was struggling with a very exacting partner in whose office I was based and found it very stressful sharing his office. I was asked to take some papers to a partner in another team and found myself crying in his office, to which he sought to reassure me- don’t worry I’m sure you will make a wonderful wife, mother, maybe even a solicitor one day…. I did not know what to say in response. I subsequently moved to another 6-month seat at the firm and was quickly nick-named ‘Dip-Dap’ by one of the more senior partners. He delighted in giving me tasks that he thought I would find difficult, e.g. accompanying tape recordings of financial trades subject to a legal undertaking whilst I spent the day sitting in a small room with 3 very cocky city traders- one of whom spent much of his down time chatting me up. The same man also got me to go to an isolated area of South London to take photos of a deserted buiness premises subject to litigation proceedings because he (quite accurately) sensed my nervousness about doing such work. Needless to say I no longer work in the legal profession but know of other women at other firms who complained of sexist behaviour and found themselves sidelined with no action against the perpetrators. "
"When I was thirdteen, two guys approached me in the underground station. One was rubbing himself at me, the other one sticking tongue in my ear. I escaped by hopping on the next train. Terrified. Since then there were so many things… There were all kind of exhibitionists. Showing their thing in the underground, or trying to hide that they were masturbating in public or on a train. Every time I screamed at them and it was really ugly to see how they all ducked their heads and fled, ashamed. Then there was this guy, also following me when I got off a train (I was 20something). Suddenly he was behind me, grabbing me, yes, by the pussy. I screamed at him so loud I must have woken up the whole neighborhood. He fled in the shadows. There was this guy who was following me when I went home (I was about 25). In a small alley he approached me, his dick in his hand. Very aggressive. I yelled and called for help. But the people who watched us from their balcony went inside. I ran away and called the police. Weeks later I was called in to maybe identify the attacker. Which I did. It was a 16year old boy who had attacked a little girl before. I asked the police what was going to happen and they said they would call me. But they never did. I often wonder if that sick kid already raped somebody. Throughout the years when I was working in restaurants there were all kinds of “not so bad” assaults. Male guests who were very offensively “flirting” with the “beautiful waitress”. Marveling on a big table (of mostly guys) about this “wonderful woman” in a loud voice..Male guests who thought that it was okay to touch the waitress, take her by the waste, put their hands on her shoulders or behind. Aks her about her phone-number and insisting to get it. Right now I am over 40. And the more I think about all those little and big assaults on me, as a woman, the sadder I become. Because I realized how normal sexism in fact is. Like, at first I only thought about those real attacks, about the exhibitionists and stuff. But while I’m writing suddenly all kinds of situations come up, where I felt that being a woman was a weakness that was turned against me: The record-company guy who instisted that he wanted to talk to the responsible person – who was me. But he wanted to talk to my male colleague nonetheless. The people who constantly asked me if I was the girlfriend of the DJ when I had been playing records the whole night myself. All those little things. One gets used to so easily…too easily. "
"My life and career are plagued by people that simply cannot see past the female stereotype that society perpetuates. It is apparently a shock that as a woman I own power tools and can complete my own DIY projects without the help of a man. When using power tools around men it is beyond obvious that they are watching and judging, waiting for me to mess it up somehow so they can say “you should have left it to the men”. It’s also a shock to men that as a women I am equally as competent as a man with technology. In fact my husband will gladly tell anyone that I’m a million times more competent than he is. But others talk to me like I am a complete idiot and then become angry when I tell them that I’m perfectly capable of managing the task they think is beyond me. As an administrator I found myself regularly put down by male members of staff. It was assumed that I would either do all of their dirty work that they couldn’t be bothered to, or that I was lazy and stupid. I was regularly told o was wrong and rarely celebrated for the things I did well. I am at the tail end of a degree in graphic design, an arena that I know is very typically male dominated. Thankfully I am old enough and wise enough now to fight back against sexism and to prove that I am an equal. But we shouldn’t have to fight to be seen as equals, we are equals! I am raising my son to know that women are just as strong and powerful as men, but even he has fallen into the traps of societal expectations of women at times and I’ve had to reprimand him for it and talk to him about why he was wrong to say those things. It feels like an endless fight to get the recognition we deserve, but I won’t stop fighting for equality. "
"I am a dance teacher and choreographer. My job is physical. A key part of my pedagogy is working to support and empower students to move freely and without judgement of their own or others’ bodies. The principal of one of the schools where I teach called me into her office and told me another staff member had made a complaint about me because I wear shorts. She told me to get a long, wrap-around skirt and to wear it over my shorts whenever I leave the dance studio. She said my shorts are “not fair on the boys”. The male P.E teachers wear shorts every day. No one has complained about them. No one asks them to wear wrap-around skirts. "
"I am a divorced woman in my 50s. I recently returned to work with a new employer, after being bullied in my previous employment. It was hard to return, trust was a big issue. What I found was my new supervisor not only bullied me but used sexist and ageist remarks continually, telling me I was incapable of doing my job. He claimed my work as his own and told me he couldn’t present it as mine. When I made a complaint to management about his behaviour he claimed I was the problem. He lied and ‘couldn’t remember’ ever saying some of the things he said. My self esteem has suffered, my confidence is at rock bottom and I continue to fight for my rights as an injured worker who was bullied in the workplace. I know I’m not alone when I say that women experience this type of behaviour every day and that the company closes ranks to protect its reputation. And guess what? They now want to get rid of me. I bet that’s not an unusual story either for women who stand up for their rights. And the authorities who are meant to protect you against this type of behaviour are ineffectual, almost useless. Workplace policies say ‘we don’t tolerate sexism, ageism, bullying’ (whatever) but what are the consequences for those who do it? In my experience, there are none. And women are left broken and depressed because no one is hearing their story. "
"I work as a receptionist. As such I am quite used to my image being scrutinized by men and women alike (whether clients or colleagues). However, when a delivery man had the audacity to tell me to “watch out” because I was “putting on weight” (unsolicited! as I was holding the door for him!) I was so speechless I simply slammed the door in his face. Why do we allow comments on women’s bodies, as if all had ownership over them? "
"I recently was in a club, dancing with my friends as the music was really nice, when all of the sudden I felt a hand put between my legs from behind, moving up. Very shocked and surprised I turned around only to find a young, merely 19ish drunk boy pulling his hand back and grinning in my face. I was still in shock for a moment, but his nasty grin made me so angry, I slapped him in the face as hard as I possibly could. (I am usually a peaceful person, but somehow I couldn’t do anything else in that moment.) The shock was then broken and I started to yell at him at the top of my voice what kind of an asshole he was and that I demanded an sincere apology. He then got angry about me daring to speak up, called me an ugly cunt on top of it all and said I should apologize to him for the slap. By this time his friends had noticed and as he got more and more aggressive and loud, trying to get at me, two of them held him back. He then was forcibly removed from the club. After telling my friends about the incident we found out that he had inappropriately touched two others as well and had followed one friend around the club for almost an hour. "
"I work at a german university and two weeks ago I went to an after work-thing with some of my colleagues. One of the guys from another department took an interest in me and tried to talk to me again and again although I mentioned my boyfriend and sat with another group of people. When I walked to the bar to get a drink he walked over and stood much too close behind me. When I shuffled and tried to keep a distance asking out of politeness and because the situation was so strange what he was getting, after a few seconds he leaned into me and said “I know you’re playing shy, but that just makes me want to have you more.” I couldn’t believe that he said that, I still can’t believe it. I experienced sexist comments before, but I was so shocked that someone I’m related to through work would say something like that. I didn’t say anything and left soon after that. Fortunately I didn’t see him after that. I can’t get myself to complain about him. I would have to talk to my boss who is a man and although I like him I’m not sure what he would (and could) do about something like that. I would feel so embarrassed and ashamed and I feel anger towards myself, because I don’t have the courage to do it. "
"My male boss (a professor at a german university) talking about a female speaker after a lecture: “Nice to look at in that dress, but regarding content she was nothing.” Everybody, including the men in the group, was bewildered by the comment (we do research on minority groups and discrimination). When a female co-worker looked at him with her eyebrows raised, he just said “Yeah yeah I know, but come on” and made a dismissing gesture. "
"I wrote in earlier today my experience of sexism but I have something I would like to add that is relevant and quite important. A lot of stories I’ve reading on here are not actually falling under the definition of sexism. I think as a result of firstly people not fully understanding what sexism is and secondly jumping on the bandwagon of victimization and blame shaming. Many of the stories here are actually fall under sexual harassment NOT sexism. Sexism is defined as the following: 1. prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially discrimination against women. 2. behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex. To clarify, getting catcalled, hit on or any other inappropriate sexual behavior is sexual harassment NOT sexism. I’m not saying its not wrong, i’m just saying its not sexism. I’m clarifying this not because I dont support the cause of changing views on sexism, but because I DO. The only way we will achieve this is by being focused and logical. Pointing the finger at every wrong doing and shouting sexism will only make the problem worse. Most sexism is subtle and people may not even realize they are doing it because it is so ingrained. It is your dad jokingly saying you shouldn’t play football because your a girl, a job which pays slightly less because you are a woman or that bloke in the office who needs to show you how to do the most basic things because deep down inside, unconsciously, they think women are inferior. I dont think anger will deal with this kind of sexism. Showing people when it happens in a non-aggressive and confrontational way will. They dont even know they are doing it. An example on how to deal with this sort of sexism: I lived in India for a year where sexism is rife. An Indian man who worked FOR me as a translator whilst I conducted research there prized himself on being very progressive and respectful of women. He spoke of it often and spoke against sexism. Yet, on many occasion he would take something out of my hands that I was doing and tell me he would show me how to do it. Once it was in regards to folding a piece of paper. He did not realize what he was doing but he was treating me as Indian men treat women, as if they cannot do anything for themselves because they are weak or stupid. Once when alone, I started by saying that sexism was so ingrained in their culture many men did not even realize they were doing it. I gave him as an example and he was aghast at his own behavior. He had not even realized he was doing that. Safe to say he was extremely apologetic and spent a good deal of time after that thinking about what his actions meant. It was a friendly conversation, no voices were raised, it was a discussion we both learnt from. Sorry for the long post but I thought it was important to share. "
"I am 31 years old. Setting aside all the varied and myriad ways I’ve experienced sexism through my life, I’d like to recount the freshest offense for you below, Reader: I went to my very first prenatal visit yesterday with my husband. I’d chosen the Doctors office due to extreme proximity to home, not through word of mouth or any positive reviews online. In point of fact, I couldn’t find ANY reviews online, which I did find odd, but not enough to not make and keep the appointment. The receptionist was lovely, the nurse was lovely…and then the Doctor entered the exam room. Suffice it to say he was cold and off-putting, but here’s where it gets surreal: while flipping through my paperwork, he asked me (without looking at me), “Your last name is Sommers?” “Yes.” “And this–” he gestured vaguely at my husband–“is Scott?” “Yes.” “And his last name is Mowery.” I could see where this was going. “Yes.” A frown from the doctor. “You’ve been married how long?” Oh, my god. “Since 2010.” He gave a guffaw full of implications and said, “Well that’s plenty long enough to have, ya know…And uh, you’ve never been pregnant before?” I had to answer and see how far he would take this. “No, we haven’t.” His response was heavy with judgement and bewilderment. “Wow, that took you a while there.” My husbands leg was bouncing so powerfully that I sincerely thought it was going to rattle off of its own accord and lodge itself firmly up the doctors arse. It sounds humorous now, but at the time I struggled to maintain my own equanimity in an attempt to balm my husbands rage. There was more, but this was the most pointedly sexist interaction of the visit. Doctors offices call it a copay, but what I really ended up doing was paying for this mans insults and judgements. I wish I had gotten up and walked out, refusing to pay for such treatment. It’s absolutely outrageous that he felt free to question my lifestyle, judge it, and proceed without consequence. "
"As a 30 year old female who has travelled a lot and and who has led a very out-going and social life, I have experienced sexism literally, a thousand times or more: – I have been drugged at a concert once by the group (Wu-Tang Killa Beez) giving the concert. Young and naive as I was, I thought being invited back-stage was super cool. Luckily, nothing happened as as soon as I realized something was up and that I felt really weird, I left and went home (acting all kinds of crazy when I got home); – I’ve been followed home in the dark twice. I live in Amsterdam, so I cycle home. Once a man came and cycled next to me, staring at me, not answering my demands of what he wanted. Just cycling next to me and staring. Very intimidating. I stopped at the first night shop that was open and called a friend. The man waited on the corner for ten minutes, looking at me. He finally left. I cycled home in terror. Another time, I was picking up a bike at a station with a friend. It was dusk. The fastest way back to town was via some Industrial areas. We were followed by a pack of howling boys, getting closer and closer. Scared the shit out of me. Luckily we were back on the main road before they caught up to us. – My latest employer said to me ‘You were wearing this coat when you walked in for your interview. I was so surprised, you look like someone who should be on the arm of a millionaire at a fair, not like an archaeologist’; – During university and fieldwork, professors have said about me (multiple times): no, she doesn”t look like the typical archaeology student, kind of smothering a smile; – Female students/professors have asked me why I put on mascara for fieldwork – since when do I have to justify myself because, as opposed to many other female archaeologists, I DO choose to shave my legs and armpits and put on mascara? I’m not judging, totally down for whatever, why are you putting me down?’; – When I was 17 and at a party (I worked in a restaurant), the elderly bosses’ son (the son was almost 40), got very drunk and incessantly followed me and kept on groping my ass and breasts. A colleague of mine, a gay man, kept on protecting me and pushing him away. I finally just decided to leave as he wouldn’t stop; – Once again at field work, the professor saw a cockroach and looked to see my reaction (I was the first to arrive). I didn’t blink an eye. His response: ‘Oh, I thought you’re the type to have made a fuss’; – My ex’s dad once told me: You’re looking worse than normal at the moment, you should wear more make-up; – In a club, my friend and I were dancing next to what was apparently the VIP area. A guy leaned out of the area towards us and said: My friend here is an investment banker’. Thanks man, cool, I totally want to fuck you now, we women can’t earn our own money of course; – My ex boyfriend blamed me for being groped in the ass. The tram was very full, some guy kept pushing his dick against my butt. I kept on moving place, but as the tram was very busy there wasn’t much room to move. He kept on moving also, so that he could keep pressing up against me. Later that day, I told my boyfriend this, fuming. He said yeah, but you can see the outline of your butt through that sweater so it’s provocative. I was wearing flowery leggings, flats and a baggy sweater that reached to my knees, how provocative. And even if I had been wearing hotpants and a tank top, that guy wouldnt have the right to touch me; – this same ex also told me that I walked like a hooker when I wore heals, so that the catcalling was my own fault; – yet another ex told me that I was attention-horny, that it was my fault when men looked at me. A friend of his once tried to rub his dick (recurring theme, ladies?) against me and this was also my fault as I had been egging him on? Until it had happened, I handn’t the slightest clue there was anything going on as we were standing in a jostling, busy queue. – Luckily my boyfriend now is incredibly supportive and notices that I frequently look down to avoid eye contact. He notices that as soon as I walk down another aisle in a supermarket (without him), men will give me dirty looks. He noticed the guy that,last week at a bar, had his hand on his girlfriends’ back, but turned around and practically undressed me with his eyes. My first reaction was to immediatly put my arm around my boyfriends’ shoulders and give him a kiss, also because I was scared that my boyfriend would blame me. He doesn’t. He notices the sexism and objectivication that I’m subjected to on nearly a daily basis and he thinks it’s terrible. Unlike my previous two boyrfriends who somehow couldn’t deal with the totally unwanted objectivication and who would then proceeded to blame me, also sexist; – A guy I once slept with (I so wish I hadn’t as the memory horrifies me, I was 18, he was 33), told me 7 years down the line, looking me up and down very appreciatively: ‘Wow, you dried up well.’ Which means that at the time it happened, he knew damned well that I was still a little girl in his eyes; – My brother once told me, after not having seen him for a while: ‘Shit, I forgot how big your biceps are for a girl’. – I have felt like a piece of meat so, so, so, so often. I’m blond and blue-eyed and have been to Italy, Greece and Turkey alone several times and just felt like I constantly had to look down at the ground. I have mutilated male genitals in my head hundreds of, fuming, feeling so unfairly treated, yet being forced to go inside because the grossly overtly sexual looks just make you feel so cheap; _ -I have had numerous facebook messages that were completely sketchy, disgusting and gross and very inappropriate from men I didn’t know; – I have been approached by some old seedy guy at the beach, asking what kind of cream I rub on my body’; I could continue. I’m getting worked up writing this, especially as, prior to reading an article on the gaurdian that discussed this platform, I read the many comments saying that a) Women should stop complaining about trivia and focus on helping women out in other countries, like Saodi Arabia, as they have it way worse; b) women should stop complaining, it’s so much better thatn 30 years ago c) The hundreds of thousands of experiences on this site are just that, experiences, which don’t say anything about the actual frequency that women are subject to sexism as the data is not controlled; d) that men, too, are subject to abuse, and so feminism is unfair. All these responses only serve to paint women as hysterious toddlers fighting for a cause that is already won. The cause is not won. We need to fight for women’s rights all over the world. We also need to make sure that we do not accept any form of feminism, how slight it might seem. Because that only works to embellish and strengthen the still unequal role of women, everywhere. It doesn’t mean that men have no right to address issues in which they feel discriminated, only that their discrimination doesn’t make femism unvalid. "
"A couple of years ago I was in an elevator at work with two (other) men. They were talking about how a woman of their acquaintance was hot, and one of them confided to the other that he would do her, while making lewd gestures with his fingers. I didn’t have time to tell them how disturbingly inappropriate that was before my floor arrived, but I did have the presence of mind to give them dirty looks. I should have to them they were disgusting. They were disgusting. "
"I work in a very male dominant industry, and whilst I get told all the time that I’m doing my job very well and am so much better than the guy I took over from, I still get treated as the ‘fluff’ in the office. If I were a man doing my job, I’d be earning a lot more and be given more opportunities such as partner, shares, etc. I don’t get invited to meetings or included in strategic discussions, as if my opinion doesn’t count – however I get held accountable to know what is going all the time and held responsible. When I comment and ask to be cc’ed on emails and included in meetings, I get teased and told to ‘wind my neck in’. Other girls in the office feel the same way but we’re too scared to say anything as we get told that we always nagging, so instead everyone keeps quite about unequal pay, double standards, different rules for the men in the office, etc. I’m 35 years old and have studied hard to get where I am today. But I constantly get asked when am I going to get married and have kids, usually along the lines of ‘why aren’t you married, what’s wrong with you’? "
"I am an older woman who began a new career in a company at the same time as a young man. Both changing direction both with disparate BAs to the industry we had joined and both ambitious. After eleven years of seeing my initially, equally qualified younger male colleague build his career – now a manager destined for directorship, I have remained as a general assistant. I had not had a review since 2011 because my long term line manager fostered the continuity of this situation and I considered it a waste of time. On his retirement I relished a new start. Sitting with my new line manager in my first review since 2011 hopeful and enthusiastic I was stunned to hear his opening assertion be that my personal main focus and goal going forward should be to support in every way I can the continuing development of my male colleagues career… "
"I go to a therapy center for my anxiety, and we care for plants as part of the program, one day a therapist asked ” for a strong man to help move a heavy plant inside”. one of the ladies there looked the therapist in the eye, walked out, lifted the pot with one hand and moved it, never breaking eye contact. ha take that !

"The other day I wrote a post about how angry I was that my sister had been sexually harassed in her workplace, and that she wasn’t going to report it. Since then, my parents spoke to her and she ended up speaking to her boss. The man who did it was escorted off the premises and fired. It’s a small victory. "
"So many things have happened lately. In no particular order: I returned to my university city to attend a wedding of a good friend lately. I am in a very serious relationship with a man I adore, but he did not accompany to this wedding. I often spoke about my boyfriend during the wedding and reception. Still, I had a creep who KNEW about him constantly hanging around me, wanting to taking photos with just me, wanting to dance with just me etc. I mean, as soon as I was away from him, catching up with other people, he would appear and try to monopolize my time. I didn’t get a moment of peace, but I remained polite. However, my politeness ended when he tried to con me into taking him into my hotel room! If this guy had actually stopped and tried to get to know me for 10 minutes, he would have learned that I went to university and lived for 7 years in this city in which he was born and lived his entire 26 or so years. And if he had known that, he would have known how stupid and transparent his lie of “To be honest, I’ll be sleeping on the street unless I can stay in your hotel room with you” sounded to me before he had even said it. The city in question is TINY. wherever he lived would not have been more than a 10-15 taxi drive away but it was probably much closer than that. When he used that line, my face dropped. I stared at him hard for a few seconds, as if studying him, and I gave him a very blunt “no” and walked away. I found out later that no long before he tried this with me, he asked a long time friend of his to be his girlfriend. It’s really had an affect on her, he apparently thinks he’s messing with her head. Creep with a capital “C”. Yesterday, I was at work and a man about 15 years my senior came in. We spoke mostly in English but I tried French when he asked if I spoke it. I’m no great shakes at French; I speak enough of it to get by, depending on the conversation, and it’s by no means perfect. Non the less, creep number 2 proceeded to tell me how sexy he found me to be. I immediately felt threatened and sick. He went on to pry as to whether I was married or not. Recently, I’ve taken to wearing an engagement style ring for these exact situations (yes stuff like this happens THAT often) so immediately said “No, engaged!”, hoping this would make him stop. It didn’t make him stop. He asked me my boyfriends name, proceeded to tell me that my boyfriends name “makes him sound like a Muslim? Is he?? Is he mixed race?”. I said “No… he’s not”. It got awkward and he soon left but I realised a little time after that the man himself was probably Muslim and mixed-race and he was trying to gauge if I’m “into that”. Lastly, off the top of my head, there is the creep who thinks we’re BFFs, He was in at my work a few months ago and I was nice to him because a) I’m a nice person anyway and b) it’s my job. NOW, whenever he’s in the city, he literally comes in to chat (as if I’m not busy, y’know, working) and gaze adoringly at me. Seriously, he will kind of hang off my desk and just stare at me while he’s i love with me and call me things like “babe” and tell me things like “if you ever get bored of your boyfriend, I’ll take you to Ibiza, I love to travel! Maybe we can get married there!”. He actually took off one of his tacky rings and made me try it on to see if it would fit and I could keep it as an engagement ring! And I CANNOT tell him to stop etc. because he’s a regular and I’ll be the one to pay for it if I do! He makes my skin crawl. I have to smile and laugh along while he tells me how I should leave the love of my life for him (he’s so BASIC in addition to being a creep) and I have to make conversation because if I don’t, he won’t say anything; he’s content to just stare at me adoringly in silence. I dread the next time he comes in on a slow day because, without other customers who require my attention, he will literally stay and put me through this for hours. "
"I’m sick of being told that men don’t get jobs or accepted to classes because less qualified women got their spots due to some diversity program. I’m sick of hearing how every one of my (very few) female co-workers in tech only have their jobs because they are attractive. Do they think this about me too? How do they all seem to know they are better than every woman (typically whom they’ve never met) that gets chosen? Why were other men placed if that was the case? Just because you were rejected doesn’t make it someone else’s fault. I’m rejected all the time for things and I don’t go around saying it’s because I’m a woman. Every time a man says this, I feel as though they are referring to me. It leads me to respect them less as a peer and a coworker. "
"Preschool I was called over to the corner of the playground where the teachers couldn’t see. Two slightly older boys took turns flashing me. I was shocked and frozen to the spot until a teacher came and dragged us all away. Junior high â€¢ A male teacher asked if I was going to join the running club, and said I should because I had “nice, long legs.” High school â€¢ A story came out the newspaper about how a prominent football player at the school had been accused of raping a girl. I knew him, and had been classmates with his younger brother at the private school where we’d all attended junior high. I watched boys joke around and laugh with the younger brother about the incident. I also watched numerous employees and families from my old school and church defend the older brother and say things like, “It’s not true. He didn’t do it.” They never mentioned the girl at all, but were victim-blaming by being rape-apologists. It was the first time I’d witnessed this, and it certainly affected my thoughts regarding rape, the Christian community, athletes and their privilege, and later, the act coming forward as a rape victim. â€¢ I was talking to my friend at her locker when a boy we knew came up behind me and mimed humping me. â€¢ In biology, a boy passed me a note suggesting we play the question game. I said okay. His questions were things like, “What size is your bra?” and “How far have you gone with a guy?” There was nothing I really wanted to ask him, but I answered his questions anyway. â€¢ My chemistry teacher was the cross country coach, very young and fit and pretty. Once a week was Lecture Day, and she’d spend the entire period at the front of class talking. I sat in the back row next a boy who would always masturbate during Lecture Day. I made eye contact with him once while he was doing it, and he just looked at me like, “What’s the big deal??” I felt embarrassed, but even more so for my teacher, who never knew it was going on. Since then, I have become a teacher myself, and this incident continues to haunt me. â€¢ I had French class with this one boy and since our previous classes were near each other, we often walked together. Once, walking through a crowded hallway, he put his fingers down the back of my pants. He said he was just trying to hold on to me so he wouldn’t lose me. I was shaken and don’t remember anything about my next classes except frantically biting my fingernails. It happened again in the following days, until finally I grabbed his arm, yanking his fingers out of my pants, and I pushed him away. He acted as though he didn’t know what he’d done wrong and I had no reason to be upset. â€¢ My high school boyfriend would sometimes whip his penis out in stairwells at school or on the school bus, expecting me to give him a hand-job. I did, because I thought I had to since I was his girlfriend. I didn’t like doing it in public though. â€¢ When I was a junior, a couple of senior guys catcalled me on the way to class and I ignored them. They treated me like I was uptight and cruel for the rest of the semester. â€¢ Once, during class, a couple of guys told me I had “DSL.” When I asked what that was, they said, “Dick-sucking lips.” â€¢ At lunch one time, I added a packet of flavor powder to my water bottle and began to shake it. My lunch table, all boys, erupted into laughter. One of the boys, my boyfriend, told me that the way I was shaking the bottle looked like I was giving a hand-job. I didn’t know any other way to shake a bottle. â€¢ At homecoming, I was approached by a boy who asked to dance with me. I started grinding on him, because that’s how everyone was dancing. I could feel him getting a hard-on and he groped me while we danced. I didn’t make a big deal about it because I figured that was what would happen when you danced like that. â€¢ Once, while talking to my crush, a couple of his friends who were sitting nearby started talking about my breasts and looking through a water bottle at them, to magnify my cleavage, I guess. I heard, “You can always see them.” It made me feel embarrassed because I was very obviously within earshot. My crush didn’t make any indication that he’d heard or cared. â€¢ The summer after high school, I lost my virginity when I was raped by a guy with whom I’d been on a date and was friends. Afterwards he told me not to tell anyone. A few days later, I saw on Facebook that he’d started dating another girl. I was in denial about what happened and victim-blamed myself; it took me awhile to understand that Iâ€™d actually been raped. The next several months were very traumatic for me, characterized by feelings of guilt, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, insomnia, and even self-harm. Later I found out that I wasn’t the only one he’d raped or sexually assaulted. I talked to his high school girlfriend, and she encouraged me to go to the police like she had. Unfortunately, we both went too late for rape kits to be collected, and they only had our testimonies. I didn’t think we stood a chance if it came to our word against his, especially since he’d been a football player in high school and was known in the community. I didn’t want to endure the strain of a trial, and I didn’t want my family to have to eitherâ€”especially because I didn’t tell them about what happened. They still don’t know. University â€¢ Told by an athlete, “Let’s see you smile!” as I was walking to class. â€¢ A group of fraternity guys were tabling outside the Student Union and shouted at me to ask if I wanted to buy tickets to some function. I ignored them, so they continued to shout at me, saying things like, “Are you depressed? Why are you so sad?” while laughing. â€¢ At a bar near campus, a guy approached me and said something about how I was pretty but he wanted to see me smile. He placed his hand on my thigh as he said so. I told him firmly, “Don’t touch me.” He put his hand on my thigh again as he leaned in to ask, “Sorry, what did you say?” I repeated myself even more forcefully: “Don’t touch me.” He pulled a face and threw up him hands in an exaggerated “my bad” gesture and walked away, like he was the injured party and I was humorless and uptight. â€¢ When I was studying abroad in Madrid, I went out one night to a nightclub with my friends. We got separated, so I decided to walk home alone, even though I was terribly drunk and had already been sick in the bathroom. As I was walking down the sidewalk, I was approached by an older man. He grabbed my butt as he passed me and whispered “guapa” in my ear. I kept going and tried not to think about it, but he must’ve circled around the block, because I saw him again and he repeated his previous actions. I didn’t like that it happened (not to mention twice), but I was relieved that I got home safely and nothing more had occurred. I told myself that it could’ve been much worse. â€¢ In my Masters program (for secondary education), we were having group discussions. A question was posed: â€œAre boys and girls educated differently?â€? I was in a group with 3 menâ€”2 of whom specialized in STEM subjectsâ€”and after I gave my opinion, they admitted that theyâ€™d never considered that girls might be educated differently. They were like, â€œHuh.â€? At least they started thinking about this before becoming licensed teachers. In the Church â€¢ As a member of a non-denominational youth group at a church in the Bible Belt, I once sat through a horribly sexist sermon. The pastor put items on a table at the front; among them were nail polish, a football helmet, an iron, and a Barbie doll. He invited two volunteersâ€”a boy and a girlâ€”to come up and divide the items into the categories of â€œboyâ€? and â€œgirl,â€? while the audience was allowed to shout out their suggestions. Of course, the football helmet went to the â€œboyâ€? side of the table, and the nail polish, the Barbie, and the iron went to the â€œgirlâ€? side. That was the first time I started having second thoughts about the Church. â€¢ As a senior in high school, I went to my churchâ€™s fall retreat. Prior to the trip, we girls were made aware of the unofficial dress code by female youth leaders. We couldn’t wear â€œthose kind of shorts that show your underwearâ€? (they were referring to Nike running shorts, which have liners); weâ€™d have to wear leggings or long spandex shorts under any short shorts we wanted to wear. Bathing suits had to be one-pieces or tankinis, and if we wore bikinis, weâ€™d have to wear non-white shirts over them. It was so weirdly specific. We were told that classic church cliche, that we had to protect the boysâ€™ hearts and minds. â€œThe retreat is for them too,â€? one youth leader said. But not for us girls? I thought. We donâ€™t get to relax. Instead we have to be on guard 24/7. A lot of the time, this is what itâ€™s like to be a woman or girl in the Church. You come in second to the men and boys. While biking â€¢ I was with a friend and we saw a two male cyclists riding towards us on the trail. My friend was about to greet them (as she does with everyone when she’s biking) when they wolf-whistled at us. So instead, we flipped them off. â€¢ Another time, while biking with the same friend, she was almost run off the road when two male cyclists rode towards us. One was in our lane and refused to move over, even though there was no way he didn’t see us. We both stopped, because she was stunned; I was mad, though. “Dude, what the heck,” I yelled, while raising my arms in confusion. Both male cyclists ignored me and kept riding. â€¢ I was making my way home after a ride when an older man sitting on his porch shouted sexual comments about my body (specifically my butt and legs) at me. It left me embarrassed, scared, and angryâ€”enough to diminish all my feelings of accomplishment following a 20-mile ride. At work â€¢ In college I worked at a fast food restaurant. Men (much older than me) who worked in the kitchen would make disgusting sexual and sexist comments about me. Often I and/or my managers were within earshot. I couldâ€™ve complained or called HR, but I knew that because of the industry I was in, my complaints wouldâ€™ve been futile. â€¢ I worked for a salsa company for a short time and occasionally served samples at my local Whole Foods. Once, while sampling a cranberry-orange salsa, I got mansplained by a guy who asked, â€œIs this really a salsa though? I feel like at a certain point itâ€™s just a fruit spread.â€? Here, I felt stuck because the first rule of retail is The Customer Is Always Right, but I also wanted to defend the product. So I said politely, â€œWell, the first ingredient listed is tomatoes, and it also contains chili powder, red peppers, and jalapenos.â€? He responded, â€œYeah, but is it really a salsa?â€? I told him, â€œIt says â€˜salsaâ€™ on the labelâ€¦â€? He said, â€œYeah, but I feel like thereâ€™s only so many ways to make salsa,â€? before walking away. I should point out that this guy was a gringoâ€”white. And Iâ€™m part Mexican. I know salsa. At the gynecologist â€¢ I’d heard the “born-again virgin” message plenty from the Church, and while I didn’t necessarily love the Christian ideology behind it, I liked that the concept was shared in other circles and communities. It seemed very feminist and empowering, for women and survivors of all genders, not to have to claim their rape as a meaningful part of their sex life or history. I liked the fact that it didn’t have to matter. Except it does, as I found out the first time I went to the gynecologist and had to fill out forms, listing the number of sexual partners I’d had and the age at which I’d become sexually active. As much as you might like to, you can’t ever really forget, or deny, the non-consensual sex to which you were subjected. Youâ€™re forced to remember and acknowledge it, and if youâ€™ve been trying to forget it, youâ€™re made to feel like you bought into a lie. â€¢ I’m queer and have sex with men and women. The last time I was at the gyno, the (female) doctor asked me, “When was the last time you had sex?” After a moment of hesitation from both of us, she followed with, “Or rather, the last time you were penetrated with a penis?” It was very blunt and it felt like an insult to who I am and to queer woman/folks everywhere, as though the ways we have sex aren’t valid. Double discrimination â€¢ I stopped telling people I was â€œbiâ€? because all too often it resulted in men assuming things about me or thinking far too much about my sex life. Once, my then-boyfriend told one of his friends that I was bi. The friend just looked at me for a moment before exclaiming, â€œWhat are you doing with him then?!â€? I felt like responding that the definition of â€œbiâ€? implies that I can be with a man or woman, but I didnâ€™t say anything. A lot of people think that bisexual women are promiscuous, or they idealize us and imagine that weâ€™re constantly having sex with really hot women (our friends) or having threesomes (two women, one man, of course). Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s portrayed in shows and movies and porn, anyway. I didnâ€™t like constantly having to explain my sexual orientation or, when I was in a relationship, justifying my choice of partner. If I have a partner, Iâ€™m loyal to them. Does anything else really matter? Should anything about our relationship matter to anyone besides us? No. â€¢ When I was at a party in college, I started kissing this girl I liked. These frat guys came over and saw us, and they started hooting and shouting and trying to film us on their phones. I flipped them off, because it wasnâ€™t a show for them. â€¢ Once, I was at a pool party and this guy I didnâ€™t know kept trying to hit on me and put his arm around me. There were some girls (who I knew were gay) on the other side of the pool, so I swam over to them, hoping the guy would get the hint. Later, when I was kissing one of the girls, he came over and said, â€œUgh, can you guys stop being so hot?â€? The girl I was with replied, â€œNope!â€? â€¢ I was at a bar with a guy friend and we were waiting to order. The bartender was a really gorgeous Asian girl and I mentioned to my friend, â€œSheâ€™s really pretty!â€? My friend thought I was hinting at him (I wasnâ€™t) and said, â€œChinky girls donâ€™t do it for me.â€? I was appalled; for one, because of his use of a slur, and for two, because I am part Filipino. I told him, â€œIâ€™m Asian,â€? and he responded, â€œNo, youâ€™re not.â€? I was even more shocked, and we argued like this (â€œYes, I am.â€? â€œNo, youâ€™re not.â€?) for maybe 30 seconds. Finally he said, â€œYouâ€™re cute, but Iâ€™m just not into chinky girls.â€? I was insulted and angered. Itâ€™s not â€œjust a preferenceâ€? when itâ€™s racist, and telling a woman that she doesnâ€™t know her own ethnicity and culture is mansplaining at its worst. â€¢ I speak Spanish and Frenchâ€”it’s part of my heritage. Usually when guys discover this, though, theyâ€™re like, â€œOoh, you should teach me [Spanish/French]â€? or â€œWe should hang out so I can practice with you.â€? Like, no, Iâ€™m not here so you can profit from my culture. Tinder â€¢ In Spain, a guy messaged me, â€œHola, te apetece un poco de sexo conmigo?â€? Right off the bat. â€¢ A guy messaged me on Facebook, saying that he saw me on Tinder and was messaging me on Facebook on the off chance that we didnâ€™t match. Dude. If we donâ€™t match, that should tell you something. â€¢ A guy messaged me a Harry Potter pickup line. I responded with, â€œHarry Potterâ€™s the way to my heart tbh.â€? He replied, â€œSo letâ€™s fuck.â€? I sent back, â€œ*disapparates*â€?. (One of my better comebacks.) â€¢ A guy messaged me with the pickup line, â€œHey, Iâ€™ll treat you like a Christmas snowstorm, Iâ€™ll give you 7 and a half inches and make it mildly inconvenient for you to move in the morning.â€? Um, ouch. â€¢ A guy messaged me, â€œYouâ€™re bi? I asked, â€œWhat does it matter?â€? He said, â€œIt doesnâ€™t.â€? (…So why ask then?) â€¢ A guy messaged me, â€œAlthough you have a cat in your pic Iâ€™m willing to look past that if youâ€™re willing to look past the fact that I donâ€™t like cats.â€? I didnâ€™t reply, and a day later he said, â€œSo Iâ€™m gonna be honestâ€¦ I swiped right cause I want someone to practice Spanish w/ and Iâ€™m down to learn french [sic].â€? â€¢ I had in my bio (among other sentences perhaps too articulate for Tinder), â€œI speak Spanish and French.â€? So many guys messaged me to ask, â€œSo do you speak English too?â€? Like, clearly I’m smart, so they have to dumb me down a little bit. â€¢ Once, my bio said something like, â€œOnly here for free beer.â€? A guy messaged me to say, â€œI can give you free gum.â€? I replied, â€œI have gum.â€? So he sent back, â€œI can give you a hard dick and cheerios.â€? â€¢ I added a guy from Tinder on Snapchat. We didnâ€™t live in the same country and hadnâ€™t even spoken on either app in ages. One day I got a snap from him and opened it to see a picture of his penis ejaculating. I blocked him immediately, but still felt gross and violated afterward. Tumblr â€¢ I posted a picture of myself in a bra on my blog. A guy I knew in real life happened to be following me and took a screenshot, then posted it on his Twitter along with some sort of snarky comment. I heard about it from friends who saw the post. I wasn’t ashamed about the picture; I was ashamed because he’d done it without my knowledge or consent. â€¢ I posted a GIF of myself sticking out my tongue. A guy reblogged it with the comment, â€œI want to come in your mouth.â€? I blocked him, and deleted the GIF too. The whole thing made me feel disgusted and disgusting. "
When I’m the only woman with a group of men and one of them swears and apologises only to me. Even if they don’t know the other men well they assume it is okay to swear in front of them but because I’m a woman I’m delicate or something. I believe they think it is respectful but it makes me feel inferior. To be fair this luckily doesn’t happen too much in my workplace as it is a fairly equal man:woman split and quite young 25-35 but it is still an issue. Although this is not anywhere near as distressing as sexual harassment I think subtle types of sexism like this is a problem and leads to the continuation of men and women feeling separate. 
"I work as a gardener on an estate with 6 other members of staff, 1 other woman and 5 men. We paid a company to give us a demonstration of a wood chipper we were thinking of buying. After talking through the machine and it’s benefits, me, my boss and colleague (both male) were allowed to try it out for 30 minutes. Afterwards the owner of the company outlined the cost and extras, and then turned to me and said ‘and don’t worry, we do it in pink!’. Neither of my colleagues said anything, but then neither did I. "
"Today the chain came off my bicycle, which – as all cyclists will know – is not difficult to fix, but results in sticky, stubborn oil caking one’s fingers and hands. I handed some paperwork into my workplace, where the receptionist commented on my oil stains: “that’s where you need a big strong man, that is”. "
"I wear unisex band shirts, jeans, and sneakers at work and don’t put on any make-up whatsoever. When there is even a trace of gender inequality, I raise my voice against it. I’ve been told by a female co-worker that I needed to “dress and act more womanly and be pretty if I want a raise or a promotion.” I asked her what she meant, and she said I talk too much for a woman and I don’t wear skirts and that people like me will not be successful because we’re not easy on the eyes&ears and men will not like us. I ignored her after hearing such mindless babble, and kept on doing what I do. A month later, I got a raise. And two months after that, I’ve been promoted to executive level. I still wear my sneakers and band shirts, and she’s still the one whining she’s not moving up the ladder, so point is: ignore the workplace sexism and do what you do. It all works out in the end. "
"I’m a 15-year-old schoolgirl and I went to talk to my local council at a meeting a few days ago about how they can tackle stereotyping and sexism in schools. After explaining the problem (teachers not reacting to sexual harassment in corridors and lessons [“mmm, this pudding tastes really good” I say to a friend in the canteen, “SO DOES MY DICK!”, teacher at our table does nothing], teachers not reacting to sexist comments about ability in certain subjects or derogatory remarks [“bitch” whenever I try to lead a group, “slut” if someone disagrees with me], teachers themselves making sexist “jokes” about ability in certain subjects, and sometimes quite serious statements [“Design technology’s really useful if you want to be an engineer. And for girls, fashion design!”], teachers making comments about how we should dress to avoid attracting unwanted attention [“don’t go out in your PE kits girls, the boys won’t be able to control themselves”]…) I then gave some of my suggestions of how it should be dealt with, the training I think teachers need to be given and the letter that needs to be sent to every school in my constituency. After my speech, I was questioned and one councillor asked “Do you think sex segregated schools would be a good solution?” I think he was expecting me to just agree, but I said no, that shouldn’t be necessary, boys and girls should be able to work together and these attitudes need to be tackled in school otherwise the shocking rates of girls in STEM will continue and we’ll grow up to continue to be harassed in the workplace. His response? “Not a sacrifice you’re willing to make, ey?”, which was met by chuckles from the other councillors. It took me a minute to realise that what he was suggesting was that I’d miss boys too much, that I actually quite like being harassed and put down on a daily basis. By the time I’d clocked what he meant things had moved on, so I didn’t get a chance to respond. Felt really cross with myself, and I’m sure that letter won’t be getting sent to the schools in my constituency. "
"Where to start? I’ve always known that sexism existed and have been subjected to it over the years as we all have, sometimes in subtle ways and other’s completely overt. However I’ve always just brushed these off, particularly when I was younger as just the things that men say and I didn’t dwell on it too much. I was always pretty quick with a retort that I felt put men in their place. Now I find myself in a workplace situation where it isn’t so easy to do that. My boss and a couple of male colleagues all sit together and I’ve increasingly found their behaviour unbearable. During the run up to International Women’s Day, myself and my female colleagues could hear our male counterparts quietly moaning about the fact that women have such a day to celebrate all things female – ignoring the fact, or possibly being ignorant of the fact that there is actually an International Men’s day as well! My boss then decided to organise a bowling trip for us all and sent round an email which said – In honour of IWD I’m organising a night out which involves no physical ability – bowling. Well you can only imagine the reaction that got! Some of my female colleagues were happy to ignore what was said in favour of a free night out however, I couldn’t! The implication that women can’t do something physical like a man can frustrated me so much so I chose to boycott the night. Anyway, the day after IWD all that I could hear my male colleagues repeating was – oh back to the patriarchy today etc etc etc. This is just one of a long list of comments that are made on a weekly basis, the latest of which being that girls can’t play football – which I find all the more galling because we are actually in the process of creating a campaign in my workplace, for a large football association aimed at getting more young girls and women into football! I hate this kind of attitude and find it difficult to understand because my Dad always actively encouraged me to get into sports and would play football with me and he would also never assume that just because I’m female I lack physical ability like my work colleagues do. As I said this is just a couple of instances of many of the last couple of years and I find it so frustrating because as soon as I or any of my female colleagues challenge or question anything, we are made out to be hysterical females who can’t take a joke – because of course it’s all just a big joke! But deep down I know it’s not a joke and that they feel threatened because in our part of the office the majority of the workforce is female so I think it’s a way for them to exert some kind of authority. I love my job and my colleagues and most of the men that work here aren’t sexist but I find it difficult that my boss has this attitude along with a couple of sidekicks who try to impress him. I won’t stay quiet though and will use any opportunity I get to stick up for what I believe in and will challenge what they say at every turn because if we don’t, then attitudes will never change. Thank you so much for this platform, I could go on for a lot longer but it’s been so helpful to get this off my chest and into an audience I know will have experienced this time and again. "
"I’m an academic in a male-dominated field. I count myself lucky to be in one of the most friendly fields in STEM and my colleagues are for the most part welcoming and respectful. Many of my coworkers tell me sexism doesn’t exist and I’m actually lucky because it’s easier for women to get hired since there are so few of us (I get this one a lot). Just in the past year, a very senior professor in my field made a comment about my ass. A very senior professor in my field kissed me on the neck. These are people I’ll have to meet at conferences for the rest of my career and I don’t feel comfortable telling them off, as I would with some random guy on the street. I don’t mention any of this to the professor I am currently working with, because I am afraid he’d minimize it and tell me it’s not a big deal. I got an offer for a permanent job recently, and the salary offer was substantially lower than that of a male colleague who got hired a few years ago in the same university with fewer qualifications and no grant money. After some aggressive negotiating on my part, I managed to bring the offer *almost* up to my male colleague’s initial pay – which he had barely negotiated. It might be that the hiring policies changed in the meantime or it might be that this is sexism, I’ll never know. "
I’m a medical student and I’ve heard patients talking about how they prefer female students and female doctors because they are more caring and empathetic. My gender is irrelevant to my ability to do my job and people shouldn’t make assumptions about me on the basis of my gender. 
"Once at work, a male colleague and I were making a cup of tea in the kitchen. He made a joke about me being pregnant (I wasn’t) and then continued to imagine what if I were. I joked back that his comments presupposed that I hadn’t been pregnant before. He then replied that actually his ex-girlfriend had had an abortion, continuing to tell me about it (with a couple of inaccuracies). We are not particularly close. What he was completely unaware of was that I had also had an abortion, two months previously. I stood in silence, listening to him explain to me certain things about it all whilst I debated whether I should, or could, say anything about my own experience. Of course, I came to the conclusion that I couldn’t as it would be deemed completely inappropriate in the workplace etc. and it would change our dynamic (potentially making working together difficult), possibly forever. So I listened to him lightly talk about this very intense experience that I, at the time, had barely even told my closest friends about, wondering whether his ex girlfriend would be happy he was telling me. I don’t know if this counts as sexism or whether it is more an issue of privacy, but I felt very weird having something (that I had been through) explained to me knowing that there was no way that I could say how I felt about it. I later told my boyfriend how weird this occurrence made me feel and he told me I was being a bit dramatic. I’m still not sure if I was being or not. "
"Where do I start? Probably the 63 year old lawyer boss who forced a kiss upon me alongside suggestive comments and groping, ultimately forcing me to leave my job. I was told I should accept it by peers – it would help me up the career ladder and he was of ‘that generation’ and should be forgiven plus ‘he will retire in a year or 2’. Then IMI where I was kept on a zero hours rolling agency contract and paid less than male counterparts and told I would never progress because women should only do secretarial work. Then the majority of job interviews where ‘off the record’ I am asked if I have a partner and plan to have children because they ‘can’t be taking that on’. Then the DWP who insisted on a household inspection because 2 females house sharing can’t be anything other than lesbians. Then the car insurers who only offer a substantial discount if I have a male partner registered too. Then there’s the corner shop next door to me where I am propositioned constantly and asked when I will be alone in my house because I ‘look like a nice, safe girl with no diseases’….and the man that grabbed me and stared at my behind in front of many witnesses who said nothing, while I was just for waiting for my friend in a public place. Then the man that saw fit to run his hand up the inside of my leg as I walked past – he got a swift kick for that. Sadly cat calling and slow drive bys seem almost pleasant compared to that! I have travelled widely and the UK is easily the most sexist place I have ever been. The list goes on…and I am told I should be grateful because at least it means I still have my looks. Real nice. "
"My sister was grabbed by her waist at work, on her ribs, by a guy nearly ten years her senior today. She isn’t reporting it unless it happens again, because she doesn’t think she should cause a fuss about something that small. She’s 5?3, eight stone, he’s 6?0, about 12 stone. He grabbed her from behind and shocked the hell out of her. I want to march into her workplace and report it myself. "
"I took early retirement from a high powered job in the public sector, I am qualified to post-graduate level. I relocated to spend more time with my family but found I needed more than grandchildren to keep me entertained. So I took a part time job in a local pharmacy. I have lost count of the number of times whilst handing out prescriptions to men young enough to be my sons I have been informed that I am a ‘Good girl’. Never, in my entire life, have I heard any man in any role told that he is a ‘good boy’. This is not the worse example of sexism, I endured a lot worse in the seventies when I started out in my career, it is just that I had hoped things would have changed by now. "
"I’m a young woman and ride motorbikes – I got my first one at 17. At my school another person in my year had a bike at the same time and so we spent a lot of time boasting about our bikes (being both proud and immature!). Every time (literally every time) I mentioned that I had a bike to someone new and male, the response would be ‘You mean a scooter?’. No one ever said that to my male friend as presumably he was fully capable of riding an actual motorbike. As I got older I started to ferry people around on the back and particularly one boyfriend would ride pillion for trips out and about. Everyone would assume it was his bike and flat out ignore me to ask him what he was riding. More recently a guy I worked with was perfectly normal and friendly – until he found out that I ride motorbikes, at which point I was told that I ‘had’ to give him my number because now I was sexy enough for him to want to sleep with. Not connected but after years of being catcalled I now cross the street if possible, to avoid any bloke in a hi-vis jacket and get extremely nervous if I have to walk past them, especially if there’s more than one person there. It makes me feel deeply self-conscious about my clothes and I avoid all eye-contact. Normally I smile at everyone and I do feel guilty about it. "
"My new employer (male) asked if both of my children were fathered by my ex- husband- knowing there was a six year gap between them and that I had a new partner and a tiny baby. He also advised me not to teach a unit of work, he had written,that made Y9 children uncomfortable- likening it to ‘torture porn’.Only he and I were in an office when the comment was made. When applying for a new job, he suggested I drop my rate to make myself more employable. I genuinely don’t think he realises he is sexist and chauvinist. "
"Like most women I have experienced depressing frustrating disgusting sexism throughout my life. Catcalling, men masturbating in public transport near me, inappropriate groping from strangers on the street from as young as my teens. While not to belittle these incidents, my life and safety has not been in danger and for that I feel lucky. So I got used to these sort of incidents. I have been lucky that in the workplace while I have experienced some sexism, it’s lower on the scale compared to friends is more ‘manly’ (cringe) professions. What has deeply shocked me is the sexism since I became a mother. Even (male) friends make comments about how I can possibly maintain a deep love for my career and raise a child. Of all the mothers I know (friends, colleagues, aquaintances) I am one of two who works full time. This is constantly, politely and discreetly frowned upon by many parents I meet, especially other mums. If my husband and I collect my child together from nursery, the teachers (mainly women) will always address me when taking about something important. The health care visitor (a woman) called my husband to book in a time to come round to see my daughter when I was away on business. He tried to book in a time but was met with huge resistance, being told ‘oh no no, just get mum to call me when she is back.’ Because how could a dad possibly know anything about his own child. So yes everyday sexism is everywhere. Women are guilty of it too. I am certain I have been sexist, untintentionally. May we all be more mindful of our behaviour and how it affects others. "
"I have shared my life with an amazing man for 30 years. I love him deeply and he loves me deeply. I’m not saying he’s perfect. No one is including me. But he does treat me with great respect as a person, as a woman, as a friend, as a lover, as the mother of our son. Hereâ€™s the sexism. I feel so lucky to share my life with him. Sure, he feels lucky to be with me too because Iâ€™m an amazing woman â€“ but Iâ€™m extra lucky because heâ€™s so rare in being a man who can cope with an unusually strong, highly intelligent woman. I donâ€™t think I should have to feel so incredibly lucky I actually feel guilty about how few decent men there are to go round and Iâ€™ve got one of them! Itâ€™s a joke between us that sometimes I ask him to make a phone call, speak to a company, explain something to someone we both know. We have both learned that a male voice will be taken seriously. That a male voice will actually get heard. So sometimes itâ€™s the practical thing to do. It makes us both angry that itâ€™s like that. As a speaker I once gave a particularly memorable talk about masculinity to a discussion society. At the start I explained my husband was sitting beside me as I gave the talk, to show that we had worked out together what I would say, because it was about men. Also I was so heavily pregnant I could not stand up for long by myself, so I leaned on him, and put my hand on his shoulder as I stood beside him, which I explained. At the end of my talk someone in the audience asked why my husband did not share giving the talk. My husband answered that he wasnâ€™t the person the club had invited to do it, as I was known for my work in the area, not him. The other person said it was obvious I was a dominating woman because I was holding my husband down as he sat beside me. A journalist asked my husband what it was like living with such a dominating woman as me? He laughed and said it was fun. The journalist said but what about being masculine? what about adventures? being a hero? He grinned, and said â€˜Iâ€™ve done all that, you see.â€™ I remember the constant assaults on me in word and action whenever I went outside the house. All the men who made stupid or nasty remarks about my body, or groped me, or tried to talk to me, who frightened me. How that meant I had far less time to study a book or report than a male student or colleague did, because my time in public was constantly interrupted and spoiled. How I became reluctant to leave the house. How it got better when I learned to drive because I was cut off, armoured in a metal box, against all the attacks and intrusions. How that gradually made me less angry, less hostile to men, which meant a more peaceful head space for me. But it also meant I gave up walking about so I put on a lot of weight! Yuk. I am now old and one of the best things about being an old woman is how men leave me alone. Iâ€™m not prime meat any more. I know I still live with the threat of assault, rape, that all women do. But I donâ€™t have the constant reminders of it when Iâ€™m out in the world. Thatâ€™s nice. Nice but wrong. "
"Once, at high school (Year 10, I think), all of the girls in my year were called into an assembly due to a lot of girls wearing skirts which were deemed “too short”. The reason given for this assembly was that women must consider their appearance far more than men, or we would essentially fail in life. We were told this “for our own good”. After the assembly (given by a female teacher, oddly enough), we were paraded across in front of a male teacher who “checked” whether our skirts were too short. Anyone wearing a too-short skirt had a letter sent home to their parents; this letter claimed that girls shouldn’t wear supposedly inappropriate clothing at school as it “made the male teachers feel uncomfortable in the workplace”. "
"Good friend of mine works as a hostess where they’re required to wear all black for their uniform. When she working on St Patrick’s Day the customer’s took her uniform as permission to pinch her on her ass because she wasn’t “wearing any green.” So many issues with this 1) it was annoying in grade school and everyone hated that stupid tradition why do it now? Oh right because they’re pervs 2) why the hell were they touching someone in a sexual manner without consent? 3) my friend told me all the men that did that to her were old enough to be her dad. Men in their 40+ -some of whom probably had kids- looked at my 19 year old friend and thought, “yeah let me touch her ass that’s appropriate” I’m so sick of hearing stories about how men interact with her and making working difficult. She’s not there for you, she’s there for a paycheck. You mean nothing to her and you certainly aren’t “obligated” to get her number or her attention outside her role as a hostess. "
"Was in a meeting yesterday where a man continually talked over women at it. At one point he told he told his coworker to stop talking and then turnd to a male colleague and said “she doesn’t know what she is talking about.” At a follow up meeting, he responded to what he thought he heard someone say. A female coworker clarified for him and he responded “no thats not what she said”. It was, in fact, what the original speaker said. "
"The topic of sexual assault has been on my mind a lot lately. I watched a TED talk where a woman pointed out that women are sexually assaulted and harassed very frequently and our society treats it so casually that we barely notice it. I wondered if I had any experiences with this, so I decided to write down all of the encounters I could remember. At first, it was difficult to recall the many experiences I had shrugged off before. However, once I started listing them out, more and more experiences came to mind. I recalled many times where with NO WARNING and NO CONSENT and outside of any sexual context, men had grabbed my butt (while I was at work), kissed me, grabbed my boobs, and it was treated so lightly. In these instances, I was so shocked and stunned, and usually so humiliated that I couldn’t think of anything to say. I just speechlessly moved on. The guy in high school who used to sneak up on me, grab my boobs, and then run off, I did say, “Stop. Don’t do that!” to, but he didn’t stop. Almost every time, these things happened in public, and nobody treated it as if it wasn’t okay. The most that anyone who witnessed these things ever did, was laugh it off. I felt like there was nothing I could do even though I felt degraded. Now, I wish that I could go back, and in every one of those circumstances, grab those people, and say, “Why did you just do that? Why do you think that it’s okay to do that?” These men had no reason to think that I was okay with what they did, but they didn’t care. People need to start caring about things like this. Just because your bored, doesn’t mean that you can kiss an unsuspecting girl your general proximity. Just because a girl has boobs, doesn’t mean that you can grab them. We need to respect each others bodies, and agency. These are just a few examples that I’m sharing, but I had a long list full of experiences that I wasn’t okay with. I’ve been pretty fortunate. I know that a lot of girls have had experiences way worse than I have, but none of these are acceptable. Most women have experienced sexual harassment or assault in some sort of way, extreme, or casual. I would just like to encourage anyone reading this to notice when people get sexually harassed or assaulted, and not stand idly by. Make the person answer why they did what they did, and why they thought it was okay, because oftentimes, they probably didn’t think about that beforehand. Women get objectified so often, that a lot of men probably don’t even notice when they cross the line of what is or isn’t appropriate. It’s important for us to increase our awareness of this problem, and do our part to solve it. "
"I made a complaint about my married male line manager having an inappropriate relationship with a married female line report 20 years his junior which crossed professional boundaries and breached his code of ethics. I made this report to his male line manager but company grievance/whistleblowing policies weren’t followed or the matter taken seriously. He was also verbally abusive to me in front of witnesses but this wasn’t taken seriously either. I was left to work in this unbearable situation for 2 weeks before I went on sick leave due to the upset of working in an environment where I was bullied for doing the right thing. I was portrayed as a neurotic woman who was making things up as I had designs on him myself. It took 3 and a half months of fighting to clear my name until a senior manager upheld all of my grievance and apologised. All of this time I have been on sick leave due to the stress this has caused. At every point I was treated less favourably due to my sex and worse still some of this bias was perpetrated by women who ‘believed the man’! I am taking my case to ACAS and my battle goes on. He has escaped any form of reprimand or censure whilst I am still disadvantaged. The company has no relationships at work policy to set standards or protect employees and says it doesn’t need one. As this is at least the third time this male manager has behaved in this way and I know of other similar situations it seems incomprehensible that an international company doesn’t see a need to protect its employees, particularly women. "
"1. At my old workplace I was the only staff member in my age group (18-25) who was expected to clean the shop floor. All the other staff members around my age were guys. All the older staff members were women, and all of them took the same stance about this. Why the double standard? Surely everyone should pull their weight seeming as they’re being paid for the same job. 2. My boyfriend and I went to a small exhibit at a local museum where you can look at and handle historical objects. Context: my boyfriend is an Archaeology student and I’m an English graduate. The man on the stand asked me if I knew what a perfume bottle was (duh) and then asked us about a different object; my boyfriend got it, yknow, being an archaeologist well-versed in identifying objects, and the guy at the stand said “the man’s got it!” as if it were some weird gender competition. He then asked my boyfriend all about what he was doing at University, and did not ask my the same questions. Just graduated with a first class degree and going on to do a Masters, thank you very much! "
"While working as a nurse, asked by a male patient I had assisted to the bathroom if I would give him a hand job. Told him, “Do it yourself!” "
"Again while working as a nurse, a patient groped my breast while pretending to tickle me under the arm. I was furious. "
"At my workplace, there is a man who is constantly harassing me. I am 20 years old, and he is a 55-year-old man with a daughter my age. He walks behind me, telling me the sexual things he would like to do to me. He would come up behind me, and tell me he had been watching me. I would be assigned to work with him on a project, and he would tell me that he would spend his time looking down my shirt instead of actually doing work. One day, he grabbed me and forced my arms behind my back as he pressed me up against him, telling me to shut up and that “I’m just giving you a hug.” I blamed myself at first, thinking that what I was wearing was the problem. So I changed. I stopped wearing tighter pants and form-fitting tops. The harassment still didn’t stop. I talked to my coworkers, and everyone told me that I was overreacting. I eventually went to my supervisor, telling her what had happened. She told me to stop making a fuss, and that it was just in the man’s personality to behave like this. I had previously enjoyed my job, but I soon began hating it. I hated having to consider my outfit every morning in terms of how he would react to it and what he would say versus what I liked. I hated feeling dirty and out of control. I didn’t like having to avoid the break room because I knew he would follow me there and harass me. I finally went to the HR manager, and he was simply told to leave me alone. He didn’t listen. He wasn’t even given a slap on the hand, just a simple suggestion to stop talking this way to me. "
"I’m an adjunct at a community college in the deep South in the US. During my annual evaluation, my two male bosses ridiculed one of my exams, one saying “These questions are terrible. Why do we hire women?” That was the Chair of the Biology Department. His second in command responded “I don’t know why. I was married to one, and they’re evil.” I’ve also heard (same workplace) the reason women don’t populate academic science in numbers equal to their male counterparts is that “if they’re good looking, they learn to shake their tits early on, so they take the easy way out.” Meanwhile, my boss says I’m “inappropriate” when I respond to such comments. Sexism. Every day. And not so subtle. "
"Not long after arriving for an 8 hour shift at work yesterday, my manager told me to go home and change clothes because I was wearing a dress that fell slightly above my knees. I was wearing black leggings underneath, and I wasn’t showing any skin from the neck down besides my hands (both details she apparently considered to be irrelevant). I was deeply disappointed to be reminded that my workplace still implements a reductive dress code that values a woman’s appearance over her work ethic or professionalism. Perhaps I was doubly disappointed because I work at a public library, which is a place that has such great potential to promote egalitarian values. In this instance, however, library personnel decided that the energy I put forth toward my work was not important, and that my time would be better spent taking close to hour off from work to drive home, change clothes, and then drive back to work. When my manager told me to go home and change clothes I was shocked, angry, and disappointed. I mulled over what I should do for a while, unable to focus on my work because of the troubling thought that the policing of women’s appearances was happening all around me, enforced by other women no less. I finally decided that the only thing I could do was to try to stand up for myself, so I ventured to my manager’s office to try to explain the harm of the library’s dress code policy. I was pretty upset and didn’t explain myself very eloquently, but I did manage to convince my manager to let me finish my shift without going home. What a strange world where you have to convince your employer to let you work, or where doing so successfully would be considered a victory. I don’t feel victorious, but I feel lucky. Countless women everyday are no doubt prevented from doing their jobs because someone, somewhere might be offended by their choice in clothing. I wonder how many of us there are. I was able to discuss my concerns with my manager, but I know other women in similar fields might not be so fortunate, and might even be fired for doing so. Workplace dress codes seem like such a small thing, but they comprise no small number of daily inequalities that women around the world face, apparently regardless of the field they work in. I’m posting this in solidarity with all of the women who have and who will be discriminated against for their clothing. If we can, let’s #leanout and speak up about workplace inequality. "
"I was scolded at work today by an older female colleague for carrying heavy boxes because ‘we employ boys to do that’. I replied ‘now now, don’t be sexist, women are just as capable of carrying heavy things as men’ Her reply was ‘yes, but you need to look after your back because you have to have babies one day’ FACE PALM.

One time my boss pressed his hand against my boob and said “oops sorry i thought that was the door” 
"I work as a swim teacher, and a father of a student I teach has always liked to obviously leer at my breasts during the lesson (I wear a sun shirt that covers me from neck to wrists). He then began to disrupt my lessons so he could talk to me (it was a better view for him). What he was doing was so obvious that my co-workers noticed. He started to ask about my personal life. He then began to make inappropriate and sexual comments to me – one in particular really angered me. After inquiring about my studies, he inferred that my university of choice was a hive of promiscuity and insinuated that I would take part in these practices. He then said, “Be a good girl, and if you’re not, at least be good at it.” I am 18 years old. All of the above was performed in front of and in the company of his children, his wife, other swim school clients and their children. The content of some of his discourse is entirely unsuitable for a workplace involving children, and he spoke with a loud voice that would be easily overheard by said minors. I spoke to my boss about how uncomfortable I was, and she dismissed it. I went home and looked up the laws regarding sexual harassment in the workplace and (with the help of a friend studying law) wrote a highly detailed report about his behaviour and how it classified as ‘sexual harrassment’. I took this report along to my next work meeting and brought up the issue. All my co-workers were horrified and thus my boss was forced to take action. No parents are allowed to sit next to the pool, and so ‘pervy dad’ can’t talk to me anymore. He has since stopped coming to the lessons altogether. When I talked to my Mum about my plan to rectify the issue, she said I was ‘overreacting’ and that he ‘probably didn’t know it was wrong’. NO woman should put up with that crap. "
"I feel like all my life I’ve been forced to put up with aspects of life that I didn’t even know I had a right to be outraged at. But I do I have a right. And I’m angry. I’m angry because, when I was 10 years old my 14 year old male cousin thought it was ok to trap me in a cupboard, pull out his penis and try to force me to touch it. I’m angry because when I told my family they did nothing and told me I’d be upsetting everybody if I kicked up a fuss. I’m angry because another close male family member thought it was ok to grope me from the age of 11 and say that I was “asking for it” and call me a whore and tell me that if we weren’t blood related he’d fuck me. And I’m angry at the other family members who told me to “get over it” and that it wasn’t “real” abuse because he never “properly” raped me. I’m angry because my school openly taught us that sex was dirty but only girls were to blame for it. I’m angry because it promoted the kind of environment where boys could run up to girls and pull their panties down in front of everybody but this wasn’t considered sexual assault by the teachers who were present. I’m angry because, like many other girls, I spent most of high school constantly wary of being groped, or having my skirt pulled up, or my shirt buttons ripped open or my bra straps grabbed. I’m angry because this was sexual assault, it was happening on a daily basis and every single adult employed by that school looked the other way. I’m angry at the teacher who stood there and did nothing when a guy sexually assaulted me in the school corridor but gave me into trouble for “fighting” when I had to punch him to get him off me. I’m angry at all the times as a young teenager I’ve felt powerless and scared when a guy has pushed me into a dark corner at a school disco and shoved his unwanted tongue in my mouth. I’m angry at every time I’ve been called “frigid” for shoving a boy off me because he thought that letting him kiss me meant that he was entitled to try to stick his hand in my underwear and I’m angry that I had to do that in the first place because a generation of boys were raised with the idea that they had the right to behave like that. I’m angry at the first male friend that I made when I went to university who made me feel as though he was genuinely interested in my friendship and then called me a manipulative bitch and accused me of leading him on when I rejected his out of the blue sexual advances. I’m angry at the fact that this has since happened over and over again, with so many men that I considered to be genuine friends. I’m angry that it’s culturally accepted by so many people that if a man is nice to a woman, she “owes” him sexual or romantic fulfillment for being so “nice” to her. I’m angry that something as regressive and disgusting as “friend-zoning” is even a concept in the 21st century. I’m angry at every single time a guy has thought he was entitled to me, to my body, to my attention. I’m angry at being made to feel guilty and shamed and ungrateful for not enjoying a first date and politely saying that I didn’t want a second one. I’m angry at all the blame being placed on me, constantly, because of my gender. I’m angry at the guy who, after I turned him down, showed up at my house late one night, stood outside my window and refused to leave or take no for an answer. And I’m angry at the films which shoved this crap down our collective throats as some kind of romantic gesture when the reality is that it’s stalking and it’s terrifying. I’m angry at the fact that I can’t go out and dance with my friends without being groped by a stranger. I’m angry at the fact that no matter what I wear, it seems to have some imaginary signal or meaning projected onto it. I’m angry at the fact that the only time I feel safe from harassment on an evening out is when I’m either in a gay bar or if I have my boyfriend with me and that even then, it’s not guaranteed. I’m angry that the time I changed my mind on an almost-one night stand because I was drunk and confused, it didn’t feel right and I didn’t want to go through with it, that within 24 hours the guy had texted around all our mutual friends telling them that I had lead him on and “used” and “humiliated” him. I’m angry that so many of them agreed that I had no right to change my mind, as though my body is not my own. I’m angry that I ended up having to apologise and make up some stupid story about me being “in a messed up place right now” to soothe this guy’s ego enough so he’d back off and stop stalking me for an explanation. I’m angry because I don’t owe anybody an explanation. I have the right to change my mind about whether or not I want to sleep with someone. I’m angry at the fact that many of the guys I’ve worked with treat the women who are wives and mothers with respect but think it’s ok to ask me how many guys I’ve been with or if I “like it dirty”. I’m angry at the male lecturer at university who told me that he thought that training women in my profession was a “waste of time and money” because we’d all just have babies and go part time, so what was the point? I’m angry for my friend who was warned not to get pregnant in her induction for her new job. I’m angry at the media for refusing to take women in power seriously, for picking apart the fashion and appearances of female politicians instead of listening to their words. I’m angry at the conservative Muslim taxi driver who thought it was ok to go on a frightening religious rant and tell me and my friend that “all you white girls behave like sluts” and that we were immoral for being on a night out and that we needed to find husbands to keep us in line. I’m angry at the fact that this isn’t the first time either of us have been told this. I’m angry because every time I get in a taxi alone I have to make a show of calling my boyfriend to tell him the license number of the cab I’m in and give him my estimated time of arrival because so many women have gone missing or been raped in taxis. I’m angry at the men who think it’s ok to catcall at me in the street. I’m angry at the fact that I don’t feel safe walking home at night. I’m angry at being called “pet” and “love” and “cutie” and “sweetheart” by men I don’t know. It’s not “harmless”, it’s demeaning and patronising. I’m angry that strangers think it’s ok to comment on my legs, my tits, my hair, as though I am nothing more than a dehumanised series of body parts to be sexually speculated about. I’m angry that someone thought it was ok to come up to me and tell me my shade of lipstick would look really great wrapped round his cock. I’m angry because someone thought it was ok to corner me outside my place of work late one evening and get his penis out and masturbate at me. I’m angry that I can be sitting in the pub with my friends and strangers think it’s socially acceptable to approach us and ask me about our pubic hair, about what we’re like in bed, about what kind of underwear we’re wearing and about whether we’ll kiss for their entertainment. I’m angry being being offended by this is somehow “uptight” because it’s “just banter”. I’m angry at the near-strangers who keep telling me that the “clock is ticking” on having babies, as if my uterus is somehow up for public discussion and I’m somehow betraying my feminine duty by being in my late 20’s and not being a wife and mother yet. I’m angry at the priests, politicians and press who think that they have the right to impose sanctions on women controlling their own fertility. I’m angry at the constant double standards. I’m angry that a woman who gave blow jobs for free drinks to multiple strangers gets slut-shamed in the national press but the men involved get a free moral pass. I’m angry that rape victims still get asked what they were wearing or how much they had to drink, as if that somehow makes their rapists less responsible for their actions. I’m angry at the fact that “casual” sexual assault, such as groping a woman without her consent on the dancefloor or a nightclub, or slapping a woman’s arse in the street, isn’t a crime but just “lads being lads”. I’m angry because it’s my body and people just don’t seem to get that. I’m sick of leaving the house and not knowing if I’m going to get sexual comments thrown at me, either in the street or in the workplace. I’m sick of having to analyse what I wear every day because I’m worried about it “attracting” or “inviting” comments or worse. And yes, I know that it’s not all men. I know that there are plenty of guys in the world who are good and decent. I’m lucky enough to have found one. But that’s not the point. The point is that I’m sick of feeling scared and violated and I’m angry because it shouldn’t have to be like this. Not for me and not for anybody else. "
e=reading your book at the moment. workplace chapter. Reminded of the former co-worker who on more than one occasion bent me over a desk and simulated having sex with me. One in front of guests (we worked at a hotel). Brushed it off because he’s gay and I’m a lesbian… now I’m not so sure. Surely that doesn’t make it ok? 
"I hate to say this but these incidences are not just contained to women. My husband is often subjected to women making comments to him about his looks and body. In his workplace women have made comments to him and me about wanting ‘to take a bite out of that”, amongst other things. I think in general as a society our behaviour is declining, and it up to all of us to make a stance. Neither of us said anything, but next time I’m going to say “That’s inapropriate.” "
A male colleague commended me for ‘speaking up’ after I participated in a discussion at a meeting with people from other companies and government representatives. Representing my organisation and participating in discussions is part of my job. 
I helped a male work mate out to jump start his car. When I parked close next to his car I was asked did I even know where my battery was. I am a 50 year old woman and have been driving for over 30 years. He was a 20 year old something. I will not be helping him out again. 
"I was a graduate student at University in the computer science department, one of very few women. I began avoiding my campus to avoid the everyday harassment I experienced there from students and faculty alike. I worked remotely on my computer instead. My supervisor didn’t like me exercising autonomy, so he made my address public information. Now everyone who was harassing me knows where I live. *Everybody* knows where I live. When I sought help through the University’s recommended channels, I was sent in circles around the University bureaucracy for almost 2 years to no avail, and lost time to work on my thesis. My supervisor then cut my funding (after my own scholarship money ran out, conveniently) on the basis that I didn’t get enough work done, which has forced me to leave school. There is a lot of fear in my every day life now and I don’t dare to go anywhere without a weapon on me. The police don’t help in these kinds of situations- they wait until after you’re assaulted, and oftentimes even then….. Meanwhile my supervisor never got in trouble and continues to be the poster-child of the University. And they wonder why there aren’t more women in tech! You need military training to avoid some of the s**t they throw at you. "
"It all started when we had to do some group work in English and one of the boys I was working with started cracking jokes that we were dating etc. I thought it was harmless but unpleasant nonetheless so I told him to stop but he didn’t and continued by detailing our ‘sex life’ to everyone on our table which went from saying we had done everything to claiming he would never touch his special girl (eugh!) and then proclaiming at the top of his lungs that we ‘stick to anal’. George (the boy) was known for being a trouble maker, so I expected everything to stop after that unpleasant lesson, but it continued. In almost every class we had together, he would mouth and imitate, orgasms, penetrative sex, and oral sex (both types), at me constantly and would yell at the top of his voice that he loved me or would follow me to California (where I was planning on moving to) or would marry me or would have kids with me etc. This harassment was constant and a number of female friends who sat close to him in certain lessons were just as sickened by it as I was but the teachers (except my English teacher) did nothing unless I expressly asked them too. Eventually I complained to the school and George was dealt with very well, but the backlash from the other boys was just horrific. They accused me of overreacting and said that it hadn’t been sexual harassment and that I was the one out of line – not George. They all started that “everything is called sexual harassment these days” and that “so many women overreact with anything funny” etc. It was horrible how many people were against me just for reporting him to the school and it really scared me when thinking about how reporting sexual harassment in the workplace might be received… God, the world is depressing… "
"Benevolent sexism. So hard to counteract, as they think they’re being nice and we’ve been conditioned not to be horrid to nice people. But, new man at work, I’ll be ready for it next time. "
"Two weeks ago I was attacked by two men because I didn’t want to have a conversation. Because I didn’t want to give them my time, because I wanted to continue chatting to my friend they thought it their personal right to verbally abuse me. Because I stood up for myself and shouted back they physically lifted me up and hung me over a wall with a sheer drop to the Thames the other side. Firstly, I was a bitch because I asked them to please, leave us alone. We aren’t out looking to meet people tonight. We are trying to have an after work drink, outside my workplace. Please, leave us alone. I only want to talk to my friend. Then I ‘Looked like dog shit anyway’ so what right did I have to refuse the conversation of these two men? Then they ‘should rip that nose ring out(my)face’ because a women had dared to demand her own personal space. After threatening several times to drown me in the river, I asked them if that’s how they speak to women. ‘You’re not a woman you’re fucking nothing to me’ was their reply. Okay then, is this how you conduct yourself with strangers? I asked. ‘You’re not a stranger you’re scum, I will drown you in the river’. I used a few choice expletives, enraged that I was being subjected to such hate, moments after sitting down in a public area to chat with my friend. One put his finger in my face, crouching down, hissing that he’ll rip the septum piercing out of my face. The other laughed along. To protect myself I grabbed hold of this mans finger and wouldn’t let go suspecting his hand would be free to punch me if I did. The threats of ‘I’ll throw you in the river’ continued, I screamed for someone to call the police whilst I furiously shouted at them to do it then, just do it! Willing them to stop all this intimidation and show me what animals they really are. They told me the police could do nothing, didn’t I know who they were? Then they lifted me off my feet and hung me over the wall. I fought them. I wrestled myself up and they threw me to the ground. The police were on their way. They fled. I was fortunate enough to retain a clear memory of what these men were wearing and after chasing them in the police car they were caught and arrested on the street. Held in a cell for the night on a charge of attempted murder. The police actively encouraged me to give statements, informing me that so many rarely do.I gave detailed accounts of what had happened, what part in this I had played (defending my self verbally)and stated time and again that I was willing to take this as far as I needed to to have this behavior a permanent and ugly scar on their records. I’ve coped well since the incident. Channeling all my energy into remembering that I am entitled to shout back if I am being verbally, let alone physically abused simply because I don’t want a conversation. A few days later I attended a talk at the Feminist Library in London with Laura Bates on the issue of Everyday Sexism. It was a painful reminder that this is happening everywhere, every day, from the smallest incidents of intimidation and fear to the extreme cases of hideous violence. The main solace I took from this talk was the confirmation that although it is some peoples opinion that I shouldn’t have #ShoutedBack I should have walked away, excepted it, not goaded them, I am in fact perfectly within my rights to have acted what ever way came naturally to me in a situation where I was the victim. Whether you shout back, fight back, walk away or are frozen to the spot in fear, it is okay. This isn’t about how I reacted, this is about the clear and simple fact that THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO ME OR TO ANYONE in the first place. Teach THEM not to behave this way, not ME how to behave if they do. I am writing this today because I have just received news that the two men are being charged, one with Common Assault and the other with a Section Four Public Behavioral Order. They have denied almost all of it. ‘Cleverly’ changing the syntax of their threats from ‘I will drown you, I will throw you in the river’ and saying that instead they ‘warned’ me that they COULD be crazy, they COULD throw me in the river. Apparently, this makes all the difference. Apparently it is their opinion that they simply ‘sat’ me on the wall, that they didn’t hang me over it. I will now be summoned to court to give evidence. I am grateful to have witnesses who are able to recount what happened with me, but simply hearing that these men can’t put their hands up and admit that what they did was wrong has shaken my emotional grip on the situation and it is through writing this here that I am trying to remind myself that this should not have happened to me. I did not do anything wrong and I will need to find the strength to take this as far as it needs to be taken until it is recognised as a criminal act. I will find that strength. "
"My story is about gender discrimination and how in a country like Germany at a multinational company, this thing still happen. After 2 weeks of starting my new job, my supervisor called me for some “feedback”. His words were: -Someone thinks you are competitive and aggressive, I can’t tell you who, but you should think about it and ask your manager about this- I was confused because after two weeks there I haven’t had the chance to do much work or interact with many people. I kept thinking and after a couple of days I asked my supervisor (my manager was out for a business trip) if there was the possibility that the person who said that about me was biased, that maybe if I were a man the comment would be that I am committed and passionate instead? He replied: -Yes, it’s because you’re a women. Look at the other girls, their are quiet and easily agree on everything- Afterwards, he started to make comments about me being too “masculine”, that I need to find a boyfriend, that I am too “dangerous” being single, and finally he told me that I need to get laid (he doesn’t even know me and he was making all these assumptions). When my manager came back I told him about this and end up being him (my supervisor) who said this about being competitive and aggressive. It took us three days of tough discussions to get to an agreement. He was reluctant to admit that was inappropriate to say what he said, and after some collaboration of my manager (Who thought this is not a big deal) he finally said: I regret have said what I said. That was his apology, not more; my manager told me that that was his apology and that I have to meet him halfway. For the peace of my mind and because I was emotionally exhausted of having to fight this by my own (they didn’t want anyone else to know) I took it and now I am confused, and very demotivated. I hope I can recover fast from this negative label that he put on me just because I showed an efficient but apparently “manly attitude” at work. "
"While working in a warehouse at a global company, I heard managers at a social event talking about a direct report commenting on her “tight fitting clothing” and saying that they would “do her any day.” This laddish culture is seen as perfectly acceptable. Managers should be trained to treat all female colleagues with respect, and not to discriminate against women excusing it as a male-dominated environment. The training was either non-existent or completely inadequate. This respectful treatment extends to beyond meeting rooms in the workplace and social events outside of it. "
"June 2013. Me and three recent graduates from the same course – two male, one female – all reached the interview stage for a job we were all qualified to do and capable of. I attended my interview and completed the practical assessment, a writing task, before the ‘informal chat’ took place. All of us were interviewed by the same two men. The first question I was asked was “am I an outgoing/social person” which completely threw me. What did they expect me to say to that? Was there a right answer? Wasn’t it pointless, because it’s not like I would have said no. I just stuttered something about enjoying socialising at sporting events with friends (I don’t go out drinking often and wasn’t sure if it was appropriate to say anyway). Afterwards I talked to one of the male grads about our interviews. When I mentioned they’d asked that question about my personality, he seemed surprised and said he wasn’t asked anything like it. The two interviewers seemed quite ‘laddish’ and were even casually chucking a tennis ball between one another at one point. That same male grad, alone with the female grad, also said they thought they seemed laddish when I discussed our interview experiences in separate conversations. The day came where we were emailed about whether we had reached the second interview stage or not. The two male grads did. Me and the female grad did not. This was particularly odd as in their job spec they had listed a driving license as a necessity – the female grad had one, one of the male grads did not. The feedback sent to me and the female grad on request was the exact same – apparently they felt we would be “somewhat underwhelmed by the role.” Apparently “the successful candidate would be predominantly producing copy” but that “we would be more suited to a more diverse role, where we could demonstrate our skills on a regular basis.” They also said they were sure “we would go on to have a long and successful career in the industry.” One year on and I am still jobless. (The female grad has better news to report though – she was in the year above me and finally got her dream job that autumn, almost a year and a half after graduating) The male grad I mentioned first eventually got the job. I saw him a month on and asked him how it was going etc. Turns out his role already involved more than “predominantly producing copy.” In fact, it actually seemed quite “diverse” (and the promotion he recently achieved is definitely very “diverse”). On top of that, he told me delightedly that the two interviewers, now his colleagues, had told him that they thought my piece of writing was the best out of everyone they interviewed. Clearly my reaction wasn’t what he expected as his face visibly dropped while I tried to deal with what felt like being punched in the stomach. If I was the best writer, why didn’t I make the second interview stage at least? Why did they ask me about my personality? Why did they fob off me and the other female grad with that utter bullshit about us being ‘too good’ for the job? For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me. If I was the best writer and they didn’t want me then I must not have the right personality. It was only when reading the chapter on women in the workplace in the Everyday Sexism book that I finally realised – I had been discriminated against because of my gender. So had the other female grad, I believe, particularly as she recently told me she felt it was the best she had ever performed in an interview. I wish at the time I had asked her and the two male grads more about how their interviews went and compared our experiences more thoroughly. I wish me and her hadn’t just chuckled about the ‘laddishness’ of the interviewers and joked that they must have wanted a bloke to join their team and be laddish with. Because what those men did was not acceptable. In fact it was quite disgraceful. Sometimes I feel like blogging a rant about it because even one year on it still bothers me, particularly as I have spent the last 10 months stacking shelves just to earn enough money to live off while I try and get a job in the industry I am qualified in. But how can I tell the world? Who would believe me? Even my own boyfriend thinks I’m “looking into it too much” and should “let it go.” And of course the company in question would never admit it. It might even be dangerous legally for me – after all, what ‘evidence’ do I have? None. I just have to keep going, stacking shelves, hoping that none of my other interview rejections have been related to my gender, knowing that I am fucking good at what I do, knowing that I have a first-class degree, but knowing that despite that, no one wants to employ me. And honestly, don’t know how much longer I can put up with it. "
"I get questioned by my own employees. Something my male business partner never experiences. I tell someone to stop doing something I get asked why, he tells someone to stop (fucking) doing something there’s no question. I often find myself having to explain my rational wayyy more than anyone else. When he’s agressive, he’s their boss, when I’m agressive it’s offensive and unfair to them. If I have to be seen as the “bitch” to get things done so be it. "
"My business partner is abusive (verbally and emotionally). Just a few words to describe him: Belittling, Racist ( I’m african american), Sexist and Homophobic. All around asshole. I come up with an idea that works, I’m then devalued and belittled in front of staff. I implement a new routine for my staff to adhere to a new law, he openly ignores my efforts until we are FINED $250 for doing the very thing I was trying to prevent, then it’s taken seriously. I want to take an afternoon off to wash my matted hair it’s a suddenly a ridiculous idea how could I ever need to do that, he wants to take the afternoon because it’s his dog’s 1st birthday it’s ridiculous of me to not understand. Never did it cross my mind that one can be in an abusive BUSINESS relationship but here I am. "
Iâ€™m a female sound engineer & Iâ€™m incredibly sick of older males asking me â€˜whereâ€™s the sound guy?â€?. Iâ€™ve had multiple occurances of (usually older) male musicians telling me the â€˜sound is no goodâ€™ & when Iâ€™ve asked a male in the room to go & pretend to â€˜fix itâ€™ but not actually change anything they suddenly say itâ€™s so much better. 
"Perhaps I am the lucky one but I haven’t had anything like the dreadful things others report happen to me. I am though, a very strong woman, brought up by a dominant mother who conditioned me to believe that I am nothing less than equal to a man. I can give as good as I get…..perhaps this is unusual. I consider myself human, female and then gay, in that order. As a gay female (who doesn’t look gay?!?!- yes this is a common compliment I receive, along with questions relating to who, in my relationship is the man and who is the woman?!?!) – I find that men do get extremely thrilled by my sexuality and have experienced everything from….ooh fancy a threesome? (with them and their girlfriend or me and mine) to……I bet I could turn you!!! The latter amuses me greatly as it implies that I chose to be gay in the same way that they chose not to be. Interestingly though, I have experienced much more inverted sexism perpetrated by women, especially in the workplace. I have worked with women who have commented on cases of rape and murder with utterances of…well, she is a bit of a slapper, or….what was she doing in that place? Shockingly I was at a meeting in which the topic of Jimmy Saville came up and heard a comment that implied that ‘these women are coming out of the woodwork and jumping on the bandwagon to make money’! Unbelievable. My view though is that, for some women, their need to be found attractive by men far outweighs the need to stick together with the ‘sisterhood’ – low self esteem? Feeling more like a woman if men ‘like’/’fancy’ her? It is a multi-faceted issue and I honestly don’t think we will get as far as we would wish to or even dream of, unless women themselves question their own values and motives. Sarah’s book certainly made me question mine. "
"I went to work at this restaurant as a waitress and in the first week I worked there I had 5 different guys ask in detail about my sex life and many others tried to grab me or said lewd things. I came to the realization that it wasn’t about me but the power dynamic. I was just a fantasy and an object which they could enact their fantasies without getting rejected. They did it because they could and they knew I couldn’t say anything without getting in trouble because you don’t scare off customers no matter how gross they are being. It got to the point where I was coming home everyday and getting a shower immediately because I felt gross. I could feel the looks, their hands and their words no matter how hard I scrubbed at my skin. I felt violated and I hated how they made me feel powerless. So I quit. I was in my work place and there wasn’t even that level of basic human decency and respect for me as a person much less are person at their job. "
Went to a colleagues leaving do. A disgusting and tediously boringold man who left my workplace a year ago showed up. he corners people and talks at them for ages. we know all about him – he knows nothing about other people’s lives coz all he does is talk – he never listens. He cornered me and he mansplained feminism to me for ages till finally someone rescued me. As I was leaving he slapped my bum. I am the same age as his daughter who he goes on about how he admires for being a strong woman. Yet he feels he can touch me in a pervy way. He is a hypocrite. worst of all I blame myself for just leaving instead of telling him to fuck off and die in a bin because I didn’t want to make a scene at my colleague’s leaving do. 
Every day I witness sexism at work. Not towards me but towards my female work colleagues. Constant inappropriate comments and gestures that actually make me feel sick at times. Every day my best friend is bombarded with things that make her feel uncomfortable but she’s afraid to speak out because she doesn’t realise that she’s allowed a voice. She can’t get through a shift without at least one person making a comment about checking her out or about how they want to “tap that ass”. I’ve called these guys out on it before and telling them that this is sexual harassment and is disrespectful and all they replied with was “you’re just jealous because we don’t find you attractive” excuse me but in what world would I be jealous of someone just because you’re not attracted to me? im gay so this made me laugh hysterically but that’s besides the point. Why did he claim that I was just jealous? There always seems to be a pathetic excuse to justify sexism and sexual harassment. It’s always either “I’m just joking” or “it’s just your womanly hormones making you overreact” or “you’re just jealous that it’s them not you” it’s pathetic. And to make matters worse my boss disregarded this and went back to whatever she was doing 
"I’m 67 so there are lots. The gyn who did the breast exam and then fondled my naked breast while he talked (I covered up quickly and pulled away). The male dentist who kept brushing his arm against my breast, nothing overt. The man who saw me pull into a motel parking lot on my motorcycle and called my room to ask me out for a drink. I felt I had to be really polite as I was pleading exhaustion. Didn’t want to find my tires slashed. Pressured into sex by men many times. Drugged and raped one time. My new boss firing me because I was female in a stereo shop where all employees were men, intimating that unless I slept with him . . . I took him literally at 21 and faded out. I’ve spoken up many times but more often just let it go, even If I was madder than hell about it.And speaking up is so often consider shrill and man–hating and ball-busting and bitchy and all that so it’s ignored anyway. Felt pretty good when I pulled into the gas station near the Grand Canyon on my 750 motorcycle with Massachusetts plates and the pump jockey said something along the lines of “girls don’t ride bikes” (I was 38 at the time) in an incredulous tone. I told him that I hadn’t noticed there was a place to put a penis in order to start it. He didn’t pursue the subject. "
"I am a teacher of 13 years experience, aged 41. We have just got a new Head of Department (two years older than me and with the same amount of teaching experience). In a departmental meeting, we disagreed about the matter of setting or not setting classes by ability. Most teachers of my subject (English) hold strong views about this. I put forward my view, which differed to his, and reasoned arguments for it. I was dismissed as ‘being emotional’ and when I insisted I was being perfectly professional, he again assured me that I was ’emotional’ about the subject and that therefore my views were invalid. He has used this adjective several times, but only with female members of his department. Since when did caring about a professional matter become a negative trait? I felt belittled and angry that my views weren’t considered. When I approached him about this, I got a barrage of bullying comments, which he was ill-advised enough to send in an email. I approached my union and asked for mediation from a member of Senior Management. To my knowledge, he was never required to explain his conduct or apologise for it and continues to use the same adjective to dismiss things that female members of staff raise with him. "
"When I left school, I went into electrical engineer as my career having loved mechanics and electrics since a child. I attained good grades in the relevant subjects at school. After the interview for the job, the interviewer told me I had excelled over the several other male candidates and to employ me was the obvious choice. My job was to carry out not only precise electrical work but also heavy duty lifting and manual work. I was physically and mentally able to do both, having been brought up helping my Dad who was also an engineer. I was utterly thrilled and extremely proud to have a job I loved and at which I was proficient. It was in a virtually male-only workplace; the only other woman was the company administrator. From the very first day I started work, to when I resigned six years later, I was subjected to sexism and sexual harassment every single day, often several times a day. The sexism included verbal attacks such as name-calling (slag, whore, split-arsed bitch), belittling and undermining (being call dumb and told I was irresponsible), being denied necessary tools and equipment ‘because I was a woman’, frequent invitations to watch my male colleagues urinate so I could look at their alleged large penises, and being asked to carry out sexual acts. I was sexually assaulted on a number of occasion, with one male colleague groping my bottom and regularly, over a period of several months, putting his hands down the front and back of my top. When I was 17, a man approaching pensionable age groped my breasts as he passed me in a doorway. He later followed me into the toilets and did the same but for longer, telling me I was a ‘lovely little girl’. I endured these daily assaults of sexual harassment from the age of 16 to 21. Before I resigned, I was so depressed about work that my doctor put me on anti-depressants and sleeping tablets and I seriously contemplated suicide. My fiancÃ© told me to leave as no job was worth my life. I am now in my 40s. I look back on what happened to me with sadness and regret that I lost the career I had worked so hard to build. I feel so desperately sorry for that young woman who was defenseless in the face of such vile treatment: when I gathered the strength to report particularly nasty and sustained abuse from a colleague to my manager, he told me that I was ‘being a typical woman’ and did nothing to help me.

"I’ve been recalling several things that happened in my childhood that relate to this site. I feel like all have had a lasting impact in some way. I remember when I was in Primary school I performing in a school play. During dress rehearsals I got my lines wrong and the (male) head teacher slapped me on the bum in a “playful” way. Later during break time I approached two female teachers to tell them about what had happened. They both told me to not make serious allegations as they “might cause a fuss”. Looking back I just can’t believe this, as a grown woman I wouldn’t expect a slap on the arse in my current workplace if I made a mistake. Fuss would vastly underestimate the action I would take, I feel let down that my teachers didn’t guide me in such a way when I was younger. In the same school I was called in at break time and asked why I always played with male friends. “what was wrong” that I didn’t want to spend time with female peers. lastly I was in a brownie group. Which you would expect to be focused on gaining practical skills! However there was a game that was often played toward the end of the evening called “witches and Princesses”. You would get told that if your hair looked nice and your nails were clean you would get to be a princess. One of the volunteer mums always tried to help me brush my hair and frantically clean my fingers whilst I was in line to be assigned. Needless to say I was always a dumpy brown haired “witch” trying to catch the skinny blonde “princesses”! "
"While completing an internship in the summer after my 3rd year of college, I was asked to take over a project from another intern. The other intern was male and had only finished his 1st year of college. At this time, we had only been working for about a month together. He frequently chatted with one of the other male interns, and was never too friendly to me. After asking him to send me the files, he said “are you sure you don’t want something easier?” I reacted pretty strongly by telling him no, this is the project I’ve been given and I can handle it. This was a wake up call for me that sexism in the workplace isn’t always in the form of an older male manager as it is typically thought of. "
"Was in a team meeting at work (I’m a programmer and the only woman in my department) and we’re talking about an upcoming seminar. The newest addition to the team suggests we can do some team building after by “heading to bars and picking up some chicks”. I wait for my three managers to step in, or anyone really, to say something, but all that follows is a few chuckles. So I finally speak up and in a voice dripping with sarcasm I exclaim, “Oh awesome! I love picking up chicks at bars.” I wait a half second for the looks of shock, and follow up with, “Let’s not. And let’s get this meeting back on track.” No one said anything or acknowledged that this happened. HR has received seven complaints for him hitting on women at the office and dismissed it as him just being “rough around the edges.” I’m so fed up with kind of stuff. "
Just got told by the bloke teaching a first aid course that he had to move cos he could see down my t-shirt while I practiced CPR and he was ‘safeguarding me’. And tried to justify it by saying another trainer distracted her clients cos her top was too low cut. Luckily the other women had my back. Felt like we couldn’t kick off properly cos he decideds if we get the certificate. Too angrey to enjoy my afternoon off now. 
"So glad that I found this blog! I have come home from work upset and need to vent! I have just finished my first week at a new job. It is in an office of a construction company so it is very male dominated. I haven’t had an office job in a while so this week I’ve been excitidly putting on my new dresses and skirts so that I can look smart and make a good impression. Today I wore a loose-fitting leather skirt, thick black tights and a long sleeve shirt, which for some reason is apparently an invite for some of the men in the office to stare at me as I walk past. I got sent home early as a Friday treat, and during my elated walk out of the office, 2 men looked up at me as I walked past, one uttered something I couldn’t hear, and the other said ‘just because you’re on a diet doesn’t mean you can’t look at the menu.’ Thus, my elated walk to my car on a Friday night turned into me thinking about everyday sexism my whole way home and becoming quite angry, because I should have walked back and stood up to those two men. I got home and ranted to my father, who said something along the lines of ‘well that’s just how it is if you’re a woman in a workplace full of men’ and actually laughed at the comment that the man made. I questioned this and said ‘but that isn’t how it should be!’ My father’s response was ‘well it may not be right But that’s just how it is’. I am a 25 year old woman, eager to progress in my career and be successful. I want to go to work, do my job and go home. But In light of my biology degree and experience in forensic science, sometimes I feel like an object. This isn’t how we should feel. I am so angry and upset that people have to go through things like this everyday, and we have to be okay with it because we don’t want to stand up for ourselves, for fear of being called a ‘bitch.’ To all the ladies of the world, I feel your pain. You are not alone. X "

"My supervisor asks me to go out speak to x (who is female) woman to woman because x is fucking useless. He tells me that he made y (a senior female lawyer) sit by the door because he didn’t like her. He tells his friend the partner is taking the male trainee out for lunch. He says “maybe he senses we don’t like this one” and points to me. Every time the make trainee walks in the room he says “here’s the lad!” And “I can’t give you any work because I have to give it to her” and points at me. He makes me run around doing Stupid tasks for him instead of giving me actual legal work. Such as calling a female lawyer who is off sick and demanding that she gives us tax advice. He doesn’t stick up for me and say he made me do this when her male boss emails me telling me not to disturb his associates when they are unwell. I am unhappy and cry. He tells me “if you can’t hack it he heat get out of the kitchen”. He constantly talks about the football with his male colleague as he knows I can’t join in. Male partner (his boss) sits me down for a chat. He tells me “I really admire my daughter. She’s smart, intelligent, ambitious, capable, super competitive but it’s really hard to be tough on a person’s behaviour when they are just the same as you”. Why do I feel as though I am being told off when it’s my supervisors behaviour that is the problem. "
"This didn’t happen recently but the anniversary is coming up and so it’s in my mind a lot now. Roughly a year ago, I was attracted to a boy for the first time. He seemed very sweet but a few days after we’d first met, he came to my room to help me with an assignment (my teacher had asked him to help me) and he took advantage of me, sexually. I was an impressionable teenager and he was in his twenties. I never went to the police- I thought/knew there wasn’t enough evidence. It was only my word against his. Now, a year later, those horrific minutes he spent assaulting me still haunt me and it makes me sad and angry that I feel I can’t report it. If I did, I’d have to deal with any legal proceedings and I might have to see him again. But the worst thing would be for him to think about me again. I’ll never forget what he did to me but I hope he’s forgotten because the thought of HIM thinking about me makes me feel ill. He’s already taken so much of my privacy, my autonomy- for him to remember what he did to me, for him to reminisce about it would only mean that he was raping me again, psychologically. "
"Received a promotional email from an online shopping site that I use frequently. Sorry to say that it made my blood boil. I am very angry and upset about the world we live in. The email was about â€œempowering beauty productsâ€? and a book written by a woman about how women can â€œempower themselvesâ€? by putting their â€œbest face forwardâ€?. In other words, itâ€™s basically stating that women need to plaster themselves in branded make-up before they can do anything worthwhile. It is very sad that a woman should be involved in this kind of marketing. There could be so much more that people could do to contribute to society. I have never ever bought any make-up products from the online shopping site, nor do I plan to. The only possible reason I can think of as to why I was sent this email is because my payment card details I use on this shopping site have a female name and title on them. Thatâ€™s it. I sometimes wonder if I have woken up inside some horrible nightmare and have to pinch myself repeatedly to make sure that I still exist. Just because I am female doesnâ€™t mean that I should be obliged to wear make-up. If men donâ€™t have to then why should I? Weâ€™re all human beings arenâ€™t we, so where is the difference here exactly? We will only ever truly be equal when women can enjoy similar hygiene habits to some men without being ridiculed. If some male astronomy professor can show up to give a lecture wearing a stripy jumper with holes in it, messy hair and an unmade up face, then I should be able as a female human being, be of a similar appearance and not be ridiculed. Just like the man, I should be judged on the content of my work and not on how I look! I have never ever seen the point of make-up (other than chap stick to stop my lips flaking). Not only does a lot of make-up contain toxic and carcinogenic products, but some of it (including eyeshadow and lipstick) contains ingredients such as glittery mica rock sourced from countries where illegal child labour is used. I have heard of stories where young girls have to work in mica mines for low wages wearing no safety equipment just so their families donâ€™t go hungry. How ironic and tragic that females in one country are â€œdisempoweredâ€? mining mica, just to empower privileged women in rich countries who can afford mica containing cosmetic products. I understand that the people working in the mica mines need what little money they get for food, clothing and medical care of their disabled relatives. I donâ€™t know what can be done to help or what can be done that lets people live their own lives so they help themselves out of this situation. The situation is deeply concerning given the dangerous working conditions. People can injure themselves doing this work without proper protective equipment and breathe in asbestos dust that harms their respiratory systems. As someone who has studied Economic Geology at an advanced level I can tell you that I was never ever made aware of the dangerous conditions that these people work in in the mica mines. All we studied in class was about fossil fuels and precious minerals. We never ever studied anything about mining rock to supply the cosmetics industry. I feel sad and very angry that I was not made aware of the deplorable conditions that some miners in some countries have to work in in order to survive. This is Economic Geology because someone is profiting from it (sadly not the mine workers themselves). Males and females work in these mines: some of them are just six years old. How can people tell exactly where these mica rocks are sourced from? This is why youâ€™ll never ever see me wear lipstick or eyeshadow because you just canâ€™t tell where this stuff comes from. Buying make-up is also prohibitively expensive for me as I am a woman on a low income and need to reserve my money for essentials. It would not be â€œempoweringâ€? for me to spend money on expensive make-up when I could be spending this money on food, soap, transport and clothing. If people ask me why I donâ€™t paint my face like a doll, I will tell them these things. I will say how pathetic it is in this awful society that women are judged on their appearance and not on the quality of work they do. Also I find make-up to be far too complicated to put on, so it is basically a very creative waste of time that serves no practical useful purpose. I work outside a lot, so if it rains, this make-up would run anyway, so what is the point? Please understand that I have nothing against people wearing cheap non-toxic, ethically sourced make-up on their faces for fun. I donâ€™t mind men wearing this kind of make-up sometimes either. I do not mind clowns of any gender wearing face-paint derived from vegetable products that is ethically sourced. What I do mind is people (especially other women) telling me that in order to be â€œempoweredâ€? as a woman that I have to wear toxic, non-ethically sourced make-up in a way that has to be dictated to me because â€œsociety says soâ€?. Some women say that women can get promoted and earn more money if they wear make-up. This isnâ€™t fair. Men donâ€™t have to do this. I donâ€™t want to earn money just on the basis of how my face looks in the morning: I want to earn money and merit based on the real work that I do. Can we please scrap this word â€œempowermentâ€? because it is very patronising to women and also gives the person supposedly doing the â€œempoweringâ€? way way too much credit and â€œbragging rightsâ€? for womenâ€™s own self-improvement. As I have painfully discovered, this word has very little to do with economic realities that many women face. It is a silly hypocrisy. What is the use of say producing â€œempoweringâ€? womenâ€™s T-Shirts produced in sweatshop conditions by women to be worn by bragging women in rich countries? This is why I really miss the 90s when I wasnâ€™t subjected to this wretched word. I played video games on my own. I solved Maths and science problems on my own at school. I worked out lots of things for myself. I did not need this word â€œempowermentâ€?. I was a kid and lots of my young female friends didnâ€™t wear make-up while playing outside on the climbing frame. I do believe in mentoring others and giving other people the tools they need. I believe in helping people out when they drop things. I do not believe in telling other women in â€œfemale empowerment campaignsâ€? that they are â€œbeautifulâ€? because they: play tennis, fly a fighter jet or put bacteria in agar jelly. Women should play tennis to play tennis, fly a fighter jet to fly a fighter jet or put bacteria in agar jelly to put bacteria in agar jelly. Doing these things doesnâ€™t make women â€œbeautifulâ€? any more than doing these things makes men â€œbeautifulâ€?. Men are expected to do stuff to get jobs done, not be â€œbeautifulâ€? (unless the men are drag queens, genderqueer or catwalk models). When have you ever heard a man being told that he is â€œbeautifulâ€? for cleaning out a drain or driving a racing car? Never. "
"Yesterday at work: Men I like, think are easy enough to get along with. But riddled with sexism. Covered in the stuff. I overheard them bickering, with the final comment being ‘shut up you lesbian’. I just couldn’t stand there and listen to it, they are constantly using sexuality as an insult. So I poked my head round, and said my piece on how its not right they throw words around like they mean nothing. I evidently touched a nerve as lesbian calling guy muttered ‘shut up you can have opinions when you have a better body’, whilst scanning me up and down, his eyes settling on my chest. I instantly felt belittled, although I wanted to be angry. As I reflect its easy to say his opinion is nothing to me, but I have massive insecurities about my body not conforming to a ‘real women’. A comment like that just eggs on the part of me that whispers that because I don’t have boobs, I’m not feminine enough. Slowly I am trying to accept myself, but he can go to hell. Words are dangerous. Your ‘joke’ is not funny. Its really not funny. "
"I’m a community health worker & I wear a uniform like a typical nurse’s uniform. Yet again today I was walking to my car in the course of my duties & a man in a car decided it would be amusing to ask for medical help when there was nothing wrong with him. And when I looked blank for a moment because I didn’t hear him at first he told me to “smile love! For God’s sake!” I wonder if I was being a bit sensitive, & perhaps he was just joking rather than being sexist? But I felt genuinely tearful & upset about it so I think it was sexism. I mean, would he have asked another man wearing a similar uniform the same question? I later thought of a come-back response, perhaps to ask him why he felt the need to comment at all. But idiots like that seem to get off on a reaction from their victim. And I was in uniform- perfect bait for someone to complain about NHS staff being grumpy. I won’t bother to report it because my employer isn’t interested. I spent the rest of the day walking to & from my car with my coat zipped up over my uniform, even though it’s hot here & I’m having hot fushes. That’s right, keep the woman covered up in case she titivates the silly boys out there. (Just needed to get that off my chest.) "
"I work as an administrator at a small University, specifically helping students with a range of disabilities to set up support. This one afternoon, I am helping an older gent get his paperwork in order. He is lovely, telling me about his life and waving through the window to his Grandkids waiting in the cafe opposit for him. I finish the appointment and have some stuff to send off for him, so I email him before I leave for the day to confirm it has been sent. All pretty standard. Come in the next morning and he has replied, saying thank you and how helpful I had been the day before. He ends the email with ‘ps that outfit looked great on you’ (weird but ok, I had been wearing a denim skirt and vest top due to the heat) ‘if only I were ten years younger…’ Not ok. Reported the email to a supervisor who sent him an email telling him not to hit on staff. He emailed an apology but will now forever be known in our office as Creepy Old Guy. "
"Told by email that I didn’t get a job because of my ‘unprofessional demeanour’. When I emailed for clarification, I was tols it was because my outfit wasn’t smart enough. O was wearing a grey dress, black tights, and black ballet pumps. Me and my friends can only think that they were opposed to either a small amount of visible bra strap, or the lack of heels. The interviewers were all women. "
"I was at work. I’m a booking agent in Amsterdam. I had a young British fella in and he mentioned in passing, as I was filling out his paper work, that he is the proud father of a 7 year old and a 7 month old. He also alluded to visiting prostitutes while he was in the city and I, knowing about his children and thinking he was joking, joked back that his wife probably wouldn’t be too thrilled about that. He nonchalantly replied “Oh I’m not married! I just like putting it ’round!”. What a gentleman, right?? So, to alleviate the awkwardness that followed THAT sentiment, I asked him “So, what are you looking to do in Amsterdam while you’re here?”. I hear an amused snort so I glance up to see him looking back at me like I’m the stupidest woman he’s ever encountered. He actually replied “Well, THAT’S a stupid question isn’t it? I’m here for the whores and the weed, of course!”. I gave him the most scathing look I could muster, icily responded “They’re called sex-workers!” and sent him on his way. Writing this, reminds me of yet another creep I encountered. This guy wanders in an an extremely busy Saturday when most of the city was full. It was VERY difficult to find a place for anyone. This guy could NOT understand why he couldn’t find a dorm bed for 10 euro in the high season in one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe. So he started on a rant about how shit the Netherlands is as a country and no one here has ANY business setting such high prices. “Your country doesn’t have mountains or beaches, it has NOTHING going for it!” he told me. I told him that I’m not Dutch but even I found what he said about my host country to be pretty insulting. But he wasn’t done. His hatred switched from the Netherlands to women! He started to rave about how things would be SO easy for him if he were a woman. “I could just wear a short skirt and a tight top and I’d have a place to stay tonight! Anyone would take me home… women have it so EASY!”. I put on a sing-song voice and, as sarcastically as I could, “agreed” with him. “Yes” I said, “because that’s TOTALLY safe! No woman has ever been attacked or killed in such a situation! And it’s not like women are ever blamed for their own attacks/rapes! You SURE would have it easy , if only you were a woman!”. He laughed in my face. "
"After finishing a gig with my band, my fellow bandmates are immediately approached offstage and surrounded with praise from the audience, and I am completely ignored, talked over, and treated like I am invisible. When I try speaking up, I am spoken over or elbowed aside. The only time I was approached after a gig was when two drunk creepy men tried to offer me a thong they’d found on the floor of a toilet. Other times, upon trying to enter various venues we were playing at, I’ve been stopped by door staff who don’t believe I’m a band member, or who ask if I’m ‘a girlfriend of the band’. I’ve had sound guys deliberately using overcomplicated terminology to try and confuse me (or imply I’m stupid), then when someone comes over to help me, they explain it dead simple to him. I’ve had one of my own band members ask me to wear something more ‘form fitting’ so we get more guys coming to gigs. I’ve been told that in the future, people might pay more attention to us because having a girl in the band is ‘interesting’. (It’s not.) Since I was in this band I’ve just been bombarded with constant sexism. People have told me it’s to be expected in such a male dominated scene. I try to dress androgynously, because actually looking like a woman has no place in our music scene. I write 80% of the material, organised our image, mix and master our tracks, create our artwork and designed our logo, and yet people never, ever assume I’ve contributed to anything, and it amazes them when they see I have. "
"A couple of years ago at college, I took a course in music technology to try and learn a little more about the career path I wanted to take. Here’s a few things that happened while I was there. By the way, this is all completely true, as unbelievable as it is. It still amazes me. I was the only female on a course of 32 guys. One of the only friends I made on my course was a guy called Jeff, who took a strong shine to me from the start, and looked after me. I fell head over heels for him and got with him, only to overhear that he’d won a bet by sleeping with me. I then overheard him go into crude detail of our night to his friends. We were put into groups of five or six, told to form a band together, and assign each person with a role (drummer, guitarist, producer, etc) so we could compose a song together, then write an essay on our roles. At the time, I only played keys, and my fellow group members wanted to make a heavy metal band. I was told by my group members that there was ‘no need for me’, as a keys player. They assigned me a role as a tea lady. Yes, a tea lady. I had to write an entire essay about making cups of tea for the band, and tidying up wires. The tutor took zero responsibility for the blatant shit I was experiencing. We had to do work experience at a local venue, micing up and setting equipment up, etc. I was repeatedly told by the staff working there that it’s ‘not a woman’s job’ (they actually said this to my face), and that it was ‘pointless me being here’ as everything was too heavy for me. At one point, while I was on my hands and knees setting a bass mic up, a band member approached me and asked if I was the ‘fluffer’, I ended up quitting the two year course after the first year. People treated it like I had wasted this amazing opportunity and heavily criticised me for it, even after I told them about the constant bullying and sexist abuse I was experiencing. To this day, I still hear about how I ‘dropped out of college, what a shame’ etc, even though it was five years ago. Oh and as for Jeff, well on my last day I entered the practice area on a break and emptied his entire bottle of lucozade all over his bag of coursework. I also took his ipod. Oh well "
"Why are many women’s clothes so impractical and designed to be sexy instead of comfortable even in workwear? I was looking for a new shirt to wear at work the other day, so many low necklines that would show my bra if I leaned over so I would have to awkwardly hold the neckline of my shirt together with the other hand if I had to pick something off the floor, see-through fabrics that I’d have to wear another top underneath which is hot and uncomfortable,clinging fabrics,blouses and shirts with odd cut-out areas, jeans designed to “enhance” your bum instead of being comfortable casual clothing, tops and jumpers that are too short and useless for keeping warm, and my pet hate FAKE POCKETS! Seriously what is wrong with adding some pockets I can actually keep useful things in? Not to mention bras that have almost no support but so much padding they’d probably double as body armour. It is so difficult to find a bra that is both supportive and not so heavily padded it feels like there’s a sofa stuffed down my shirt! And don’t get me started on shoes, are they designed by people who hate us all and want to torture us? "
"I work at a financial services trade organization in Washington, DC. I do excellent analysis, and am also shouldered with 90% of the administrative work in our section. I work upwards of 60 hours a week, performing multiple duties for individuals across the organization. Recently, I asked for a raise, and was told that I was being “demanding.” I have been patted on the head in meetings and have been regularly humiliated on the job (other people get credit for my work, I regularly fulfill a secretary role and plan meetings, etc). I got the raise – but it was about 13k less than both me and my boss were expecting. Additionally, I got zero back pay, after being promised backpay several times. One person decided my pay, and refuses to give an explanation as to why I’m being paid what I am. Meanwhile, the male analyst is getting paid substantially more, and is being promised his own position and six figures when he passes the bar. I have not gone to law school, but we have the same title, and I do substantially more work in nearly every section of the organization. I have to leave for my own sanity. My boss doesn’t understand why this is unjust, and neither does anyone else at the organization. I found a subject I love, but am being essentially forced to leave because I’m a woman. "
"As I was about to enter the building where I work, a man I’ve never met walked by me and exclaimed “Why do you look so angry? You need to smile!” and started laughing very loudly as he walked away. I paused and then shouted back at him “Hey man, don’t tell me what to do with my body!”. He didn’t say anything he just kept walking and laughing. This was a small incident, and I didn’t mean to “blow it out of proportion” but later that day I was visiting with my aunt and I told her what happened and how I was proud that I stood up for myself. I expected her to be on my side or say something validating. But to my surprise, she started saying how if he had been cute, I wouldn’t have minded or that he just wanted to say hi to me. I responded by saying if he wanted to say hi to me, he should have done that instead of telling me what to do. I considered his behavior aggressive but she said I was just afraid of men. I reminded her I work with many men in my office and since I am in management, I would not be able to do my job if I was afraid of men. The conversation escalated to an argument and ultimately led nowhere. I was left with the disappointing feeling that another woman, one that should be advocating for our right to be respected as a relative, mother, and minority was agreeing that women should just accept any kind of behavior from a man.

"I’m a very experienced artist manager in the music industry. The day to day sexism I encounter by being a woman in music is often subtle and sometimes so obvious it’s embarrassing. I’m often referred to as a “secretary” and PA, there’s nothing wrong with either of those jobs but it’s not my role and the truth is those titles wouldn’t be used if I was a male. The other night at a high profile charity function, I was having a pleasant conversation with a male manager (who is lovely) when we were approached by an older man in the industry. He completely blanked me, cut me off from any sentence I was in the middle of and didn’t make eye contact with me once. This wasn’t just rudeness, it was sexism as the truth is, I’m more experienced and my artists are more iconic than that of my fabulous male colleague. I would like to know what the music industry is doing to help its women? Great that we have “women in music” awards but actually on a day to day basis, nothing has changed in the last 30 years. At. All. There’s a reason there are few women in exec roles in music and that’s because no record label has had the balls yet to help in any real way. The most real way to do this would be to set up in-house daycare for our amazing children. I love my industry, I love my artist, I love a lot of the younger people coming through the ranks that I work with, it’s just a shame that the most powerful execs are not as progressive as they think they are.

He laughs and proceeds to give me a 2 min lecture about the difference between hardware and software in computers. Then he tells me to make sure to find someone handy to help me. Instead of asking for a clarification, he assumes that I don’t know what I’m talking about. "

"I work in a cash office for a supermarket and sometimes I help with the delivery and being on the till, today was one of those days where nothing is going right and we are really behind. My colleague ( who’s male) and I are on a till and there is a lull in customers so I go to help with the delivery. My till buddy calls me over and I’m thinking he’s got a problem with the customer he’s serving. Nope he tells me to stay on the till and he will stock shelves. Ok I’ll say nothing and get on with it I’ve other things to do today. It’s getting busy so he comes back to serve the long line of customers and whilst serving he turns to me to say that he didn’t like to see me physically working as in his country the women don’t work like that. Ehhh?? You’re not in your country, you need to change your attitude, yes all women work in some form and don’t say that to me! He then whispers in my ear ( please remember that we are in public, at work and both behind a till and serving customers throughout this exchange) he whispers you will never be my equal in a very threatening tone in my ear. WTF? He catches me off guard as I’m still reeling from the first comment. That’s not ok I say I’m only joking he says. Doesn’t matter what you meant it’s what you said I say . So it’s awkward for the next hour or so and he keeps smiling over at me saying it was a joke and am I ok? The final insult is when after all the work is done and I’m about to go back to my wee windowless office and do things like process people’s wages he comes over to me puts his hands on my shoulders and says you know Carrie I was only joking. Get your fucking hands off me now is NOT what I say. I smile as a way of forgiveness ,move away from him raging at myself that he’s got under my skin. As what’s the benefit? Better rising above it? Now I feel like the dickhead. "

"I work in a male dominated environment on the railway. My train had a problem with it so I rectified it and called our maintenance department. The man at the end of the phone patronised me by telling me that the equipment wasn’t at fault “maybe you haven’t done x, y, z” basically a process that I do hundreds of times per day. I was calling him to report an incident and that I had rectified it. Not for him to treat me like I don’t know my own job – of which I go through the same rigourous training as a man. The industry is horrendously sexist. When you get people talking down to you when you have to work twice as hard as it is? It is everyday sexism. "

In a male-dominated world I am an ardent supporter of vulnerable people, so felt sensitive to this remark. After a lot of thought I emailed the colleague to say that I thought her remark was unacceptable and attitudes like that keep us in the dark ages.

"Until I started reading the stories on here,I didn’t realise how much,and also how often,I have encountered Sexism.It genuinely has become accepted in today’s society,and this is wrong on so many levels. I was Sexually Harrased at 17 at my first job,it was a mainly male workplace ,and they were all at least 5 years older than me.It came to a peak when one male,who was at least 35, started to offer me money to sleep with him and would corner me in the kitchen.I left,it was only when I mentioned it to my parents and saw their horrified reactions, I realised how wrong the situation was. As a barmaid,in my early 20’s,the regulars,male,would play “Guess the Bra Size” .The male landlord would laugh along with them. On the bus/train,men who stand too close,stare,try to talk to me and brush up against me. In my current job in Retail,male customers buying lingerie ” she’s about your size” then stare at my chest. “I want to talk to the manager” I am the manager… They then proceed to talk to male staff members,who constantly try to send them back to me because I am their Manager.

"I’m a young (female) musician. My boyfriend is also a musician, and we were both invited to perform with a high profile band. It was a fantastic opportunity that we were really excited about, as we were playing with some really well known musicians who we really admired (all male, as is often the case in my industry). The other musicians didn’t know that my boyfriend and I were a couple. (We choose not to advertise this as I would like to be recognised as an accomplished musician in my own right – but that’s another story.) After one of the shows, the rest of the band were chatting while I was packing up my gear. One of the musicians commented that he hadn’t expected me to be such a great musician, and that he was really pleasantly surprised because you don’t often see good female instrumentalists. My boyfriend told me this later in private, meaning to pass on the compliment. …I get the intention of the statement, and really appreciate the positive sentiment… however I find it a bit strange that before people hear me play – even seasoned professionals that I look up to – they expect me to be bad, and assume that I am on stage for my looks or because I “know” someone. It’s up to me to “prove” this wrong. Every time. No one doubts that my boyfriend can play well before they hear him. "
"Today I had someone call me with an enquiry at work. We don’t handle most enquiries over the phone so I told her to send an email. I gave her the email address, spelled it out to be SURE that she was writing to the correct address, told her wat information to include etc. At the end of it she must have known full well that she was addressing a woman. Her email arrives a little while later and what does it begin with? “Dear Sir. . .” "
"This is a more general gripe rather than a specific event. I’m just frustrated on an almost daily basis at the way in which women are underestimated in the workplace. Even in a fairly progressive place of work such as the one I work in, there is still a culture among some (not all) men that they are the only one’s capable of doing the ‘important’ work and making the ‘real’ contribution. This attitude is often so under-radar and subtle that it takes a couple of days before the dawning realisation that I’ve had some sexism done at me sinks in. Often it feels as though this sexism prevents women from being able to progress in their careers, and is always, without fail, driven by the fragile male ego and the perceived threat that women might actually be smarter and have more potential than they would like. This is especially problematic when a woman’s physical appearance and attributes stir up all sorts of confusing ‘feelings’, both mental and erm, ‘physiological’… ðŸ˜‰ "
"I have recently suffered a very distressing bereavement. A few days afterwards, my new boss arrived from America. Despite my emotional difficulties I put everything aside to work very hard to prepare meetings, presentations and his schedule for him. One evening I took him out to dinner and as we drove to the restaurant his eyes were on stalks as he took in all the pretty women walking around London. He said “everyone is so young and hot – this is my kind of place.” Later on, after several drinks, I burst into tears and talked about my friend dying. He took that opportunity, when I was at my most vulnerable, to put his hand up my skirt, grab my hair and try to kiss me. Twice. I pulled away, telling him that it was inappropriate, that he was my boss and saying ‘no’. I then got us both taxis although he wouldn’t stop asking me why he wasn’t coming back to my place. The next day, not only was he very late for the meetings I had prepared for him, he denied all knowledge of what had happened the night before and just laughed about it all. I confronted him and told him that it was inappropriate, he had to know the boundaries and respect me as a colleague. I feel violated by this man and unable to work for him. I have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace before and had even confided that in him earlier on in the day and he had expressed disgust and said that that kind of behaviour would not be tolerated. What a hypocrite. Now I am looking for another job but I’m afraid to say anything in case I’m pigeon-holed as being ‘troublesome’ or ‘litigious’. "
"At a radio station I used to work for, I once took the work car on an overnight trip and inadvertently left one of my bras in the boot of the car – where my luggage had been along with a lot of equipment. The next week, a male colleague sent an all-staff email saying he had found a bra, and described the size and appearance, asking for someone to claim it. A simple process of deduction would have revealed it was mine, but nothing was said, and being too embarrassed, I didn’t claim it and hoped it would all go away. Next, the bra was handed around the office with a lot of scoffing and joking, and ended up hung from a male colleague’s radio antenna, where it stayed for several weeks. Whenever a woman commented on it, they were challenged as to whether it was their size. Finally it was removed after I emailed the manager suggesting it wasn’t professional office behaviour. It was a humiliating experience that didn’t belong in such a positive workplace, but that I believe was caused by the men in question being oblivious to 1.) what sexist behaviour is, and 2.) the fact they were doing it.

"I had my hair cut very short and my male boss, in an informal meeting with myself and a visiting engineering contractor, said in a supposedly “jokey” way, “You look like a cunt”. I told him that I had my hair cut for myself, and not to please anyone, not even my husband. The engineer guy said, “It’s just a bit of banter”. It always is, isn’t it? It’s very difficult to respond and defend myself in these situations when I normally get on very well with the men I work with, and they know that I’ll stand up for myself. They’re not bad guys, just part of the society we’re born into, and yet sometimes I wish I could be more emphatic about what I think is sexist (and there are many instances of “banter” and other remarks daily – it’s a meat plant and dominated by men). They always manage to turn my protestations around to imply that I can’t take a joke, or I’m taking things too seriously, especially when we’re all having a good “laugh” about something. Bloody frustrating, annoying and condescending. "
"A male colleague said recently that ‘In his opinion’ men are better drivers than women. When I challenged him on this, as his opinion carried no weight – I need facts – he then asked me to name one female formula 1 driver and when I couldn’t ( Ironic at how he used a sexist sport to back up his opinion) he felt that was enough to prove his point. Whether men or women are better at driving is irrelevant – we all have our strengths and weaknesses and they shift and change all the time. The fact that he felt the need to make this point and that he was able to do so without the manager or other colleagues challenging him or pointing out that his opinion was sexist is what is wrong with this world. He also made a point to say ‘People think I’m sexist but I’m not’ which again says a lot about him! This is just one of many sexist/racist comments that come from him – I actually feel sorry for him as he is very insecure and makes jokes and comments about and to others so he can feel better about himself!

When I challenged him on this, as his opinion carried no weight – I need facts – he then asked me to name one female formula 1 driver and when I couldn’t ( Ironic at how he used a sexist sport to back up his opinion) he felt that was enough to prove his point. Whether men or women are better at driving is irrelevant – we all have our strengths and weaknesses and they shift and change all the time. The fact that he felt the need to make this point and that he was able to do so without the manager or other colleagues challenging him or pointing out that his opinion was sexist is what is wrong with this world. He also made a point to say ‘People think I’m sexist but I’m not’ which again says a lot about him! This is just one of many sexist/racist comments that come from him – I actually feel sorry for him as he is very insecure and makes jokes and comments about and to others so he can feel better about himself!

"After reading your book, so much in my life has revealed itself to me as utterly grotesque. I’m 19 and I’ve been a feminist since I found out what it was and consider myself very aware of women’s issues but reading about other people’s experiences just kind of brought a lot of things forward in my memory. Being catcalled by men 40+ at age 12, boys who I went to school with asking to ‘spit-roast’ me, telling me to get on my knees, asking me at least 4 times a day if I would suck them off also from age 12, having my arse grabbed in clubs and when I turn to confront them getting told I’m a ‘fucking uptight bitch, I didn’t even do anything’, a teacher in school telling me I was on my period after I spoke out about something I thought was wrong, being emotionally manipulated into sex by an ex for 2 years and going into the bathroom to cry afterwards, falling half asleep while drunk and waking up to find a boy feeling my crotch at age 14, being yelled at and touched on public transport, an old woman shouting ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ at me after I kissed my boyfriend goodbye, my manager at a bar I used to work at slowly pushing all of the young female staff out of work because they wouldn’t let him be creepy to them. It’s just endless and I hate it, it makes me so uneasy and anxious and every time I’m walking somewhere at night I’m terrified of being attacked or raped. It’s so commonplace which is disgusting, I don’t know any one of my female friends who haven’t been touched/catcalled/assaulted/raped. My mum still tells me stories about her bum getting grabbed when she goes out and of being attacked in dark alleyways when she was my age, but I’m lucky that I had such a strong female figure like her bringing me up otherwise I don’t think I would be fighting back as much as I am. I now dislike how full my boobs and butt are and hide them under layers because it makes me feel uncomfortable when they’re visible and my sex drive is almost nonexistent after that what that last boyfriend did because he felt like I owed it to him. I can’t believe some people I talk to about this stuff still disagree with sexism still being a problem and cringe when I say the word ‘feminist’ when it’s effected my life and every girl I know so much.

"I work in a newsroom (which is the most sexist workplace I’ve ever encountered)… A massive story broke regarding a woman being raped by a high profile footballer. The woman was interviewed in shadow to conceal her identity and while the tape was being played back, a large group of male colleagues gathered to watch it. At one point, when the woman spoke about her assault – one of the guys interjected with, ‘this girl just wants media attention, she asked for it, she went looking to bang a footballer’. As the only female in the room, and with a close relative who is a victim of rape, I went completely nuts and blasted the guy. His only defence was, ‘hey, I know women who’ve been raped too!’… I was just aghast. My only reply to that was, ‘if you really know someone who has survived rape, and you understand the horror, why imply that women ASK for it?’… I just don’t understand. "
I was dumped by a girl for allegedly not pleasuring her enough and soon I found out she had told all her girlfriends about my small Penis.

"This was what happened to me when I’d just started working at my current job. I was 17 at the time. I was working on my till and a young man came through to buy alcohol. I asked him for ID and he became annoyed, he obviously didn’t have it because he kept asking me to put the purchase through anyway. I refused and called over my manager as I could tell he was going to make a fuss. My manager explained everything and left quickly. He still tried to get me to put it through the alcohol. When I told him that he could ask all he wants but I can’t serve him without ID, he said straight to my face “You know what, f*ck it! Go sit on a cucumber, you frigid b*tch!” He then went to a male cashier who also refused to serve him but he just left, he didn’t insult the male cashier in any way, he just left silently. I finished my shift at about 8:30 pm so I started walking into town still in my work uniform (definitely nothing appealing about wide legged trousers and a blouse that’s too big) to pick up some food before getting a cab home. In the 10 minute walk from work to the takeaway shop, I got catcalled twice, once from a moving car and once from a bouncer outside a club. Then when walking to the taxi rank with my food, a guy (who was probably already drunk, he definitely smelt like it) called out “Sugartits, wanna take that back to mine?” and then started walking to the taxi rank with me saying what he’d do if I went back to his. He didn’t seem to notice I had put my headphones in after he called out to me the first time so I only heard bits of it. And as the cherry on top of the proverbial cake, when I was getting in the cab, he slapped my ass before wolf whistling and walking away. "
"My boss (who is a woman) told me that my other boss who is a man said that I was being difficult to work with. This after the one time that I spoke up to say something wasn’t going well after a year of trying to make the most of a not so great workplace. She told me she didn’t agree with him, that it was probably sexist, but I would just have to play the game and appease him and “play nice” with everyone. AKA back down and don’t speak up again. Would you tell someone of a minority race to ignore workplace racism and “play the game?” How is it okay when it’s about gender? "
"I am a middle school teacher. I was teaching the Suffragette Movement to my seventh graders when a boy asked me why we are studying this because everyone is “equal”. Two days later my principal, who is a male, calls me into his office asking my why I called that boy a sexist. I never did, but a boy accused me and told the male principal. My boss then proceeds to tell me how the women wage gap is a myth and I needed to fact check before I told students information. Since when do all women make the same wage as a white man? Tell me again sexism doesn’t exist. "
"Today a colleague made a sex joke about me and it was really disturbing… I expressed my anger about the event to other women in the workplace, but their light response was: â€˜you should stop finding flaws in everybodyâ€™. At a former job, the team leader once pulled me aside and kissed me on the lips, though he was married with a pregnant partner. My initial reaction was embarrassment. I told him cynically: â€˜is this how colleagues interact?!â€™ He used to grope me to â€˜check my bellyâ€™, pull my shirt up to my waist and get really close to me when I was working. I asked him nicely, I lashed out, I threatened him, I even left an article on sexual harassment in his bag as ways to make him stop. Nothing changed. I was afraid of telling the boss because I was afraid he wouldnâ€™t believe me and I would somehow lose my job. Another colleague proposed to offer me money in exchange of sexual favors and used to get really close to me and make comments about my body and what he would â€˜doâ€™ to me… When he wasnâ€™t sexual, he would be aggressive in language. One day, he cursed me and I felt so humiliated that I left home before the shift was done. When I called my boss to tell him what happened, he told me I should stop doing that, that I probably allowed the guy to behave like that towards me and… that the problem was me. In college, I slept with someone when I was drunk. The second day, it felt like I had been (emotionally) raped. (See date rape and rape on campuses) When I was thirteen, an adult male sat next to me and started touching one of my breasts and grinning at me while at it. There were some people next to us… I freaked out and I left the scene. All the comments about my body, all the sexual offers and propositions, all the harassment throughout my life, all the stuff that used to feel normal but now make me go crazy. All the misogynistic women around me. Yes, there are female misogynists. Women who hate women in a sexualized way. All of that. Iâ€™m so grateful to be able to post here. A community can be strong.

"I often get cat called on the streets, wearing normal everyday clothes. Jeans, t-shirt, trainers. I’m not exactly an attractive woman, and I don’t make an effort to look that way when I don’t have to. Besides that, I’ve also been targeted by males, often ex-colleagues, who think that just because they’re male they immediately have control over everything I do, even when I’m not dating them. They make sexual demands no matter how many times I’ve said no, and expect to receive them in repayment for their friendship. If I don’t like you, I won’t date you. I’ve started to call them out on their behaviour but they never own up to it, or they get so scared that they back out and start to deny their actions. Sometimes they try to guilt trip me. My ex boyfriend tried it after I broke it off with him because of his anger issues, and many of my male friends who knew about it stuck to my side. The whole idea of having sexual power over a woman just because she is what she is, or because a man thinks she owes him something sexual for some reason, is one of the most pervasive and insidious things I’ve ever had to deal with. It’s disgusting. Then there are workplace expectations. My own mother once said that I wasn’t allowed to wear pants in the workforce, had to wear a skirt because that’s ‘what women do’. I shouldn’t have to show skin to be recognised for my skill set and earn a decent living. Other family members, women, have been surprised that I have a strong interest in woodwork and mechanics, and that I actively demonstrate my advanced skills in those areas. People look down on me because I want to start my own business and own property. Apparently women can’t do that, despite the many examples to the contrary. "
"When I first came to Australia (from Europe) and in a Women-in-Management meeting raised the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, the women – all 35+ – started laughing and sniggering. They really thought it was a funny subject, and said ‘we’ should be glad to get some attention from men! I had a good mind to tell them they not only were their own worst enemies but they were a generation behind their contemporaries in Europe. I didn’t say anything as it would have turned them all against me. Just now I saw a TV interview with Laura Bates in Sydney (St James Ethics centre). This problem was raised in relation to breastfeeding in public – where women were the ones coming forward to harass the mother for feeding her baby. Unbelievable. If I ever hear it I will come to the mother’s defence and this time speak my mind! Such women need to wake up! "
"I am 17 years old and I go to a high school that is very male dominated. I am already a huge feminist and believe strongly that men and women should be totally equal in todays society. I recently just wrote a paper on it as well. My school teaches us that us women should cover our bodies and be shamed, because it is a distraction in the education system, just like many schools in America and the UK. why should our bodies, that GOD created be out to shame and why do we have to feel uncomfortable in our skin? that is constantly my question. The fingers are being pointed in the wrong direction and we should not have to adjust ourselves to adapt to this male dominated society. I have also noticed my classroom settings. MULTIPLE classrooms i am in the ratio’s of male to female are absurd. I am one of 5 girls in a classroom with 20 males and a male teacher. the lessons taught in the classroom are directed towards the males, instead of us females. very sad how our society treats women. without us, these men wouldn’t even be here in the world. it is sad that sexism is shown in such an early stage in life. Cant wait to grow up and see how horrible it must be in the workplace. "
"I’ve been harassed almost every day of my life; walking on the street and taking public transit are usually where this happens. It has happened at work as well, when I used to work in the service industry, but I didn’t last long there. The reason for that is that never in my entire life I’ve taken harassment in silence. Not when it happens to me, and not when I see it happen to others. Women or not, although I can probably count on the fingers of one hand how many times I’ve witnessed a man get harassed. I shout back when I get cat called, and in the beginning I used to get very tense… My legs would shake and my face would burn up, but I’d still yell “f**k right off you f**king c*nt. I will rip your head off!” with all the confidence I could muster. Everyone always stops and looks and c*nt in question backs off. Sometimes they call be a “crazy b” and I yell back “you have no idea!”. Although I never planned much further than yelling back, I’ve always felt this immense relief when I noticed how pathetic they were that they’d just cower and walk away. On public transit I’ve looked square in the eyes of guys who have groped me and said “I will murder you if you touch me again” and they never know what to do. In bars I have literally punched a guy so hard he fell on the floor and his friends came apologizing profusely at me while I attempted to kick him. As I said, in the beginning I’d get tense because I was scared. My legs still shake today and my face still burns up, and my eyes definitely still get teared up, but it’s with anger now. I am fed up, but I still yell back. I am fed up, but I will never look down and pretend it wasn’t with me. It was never normal to me and it will never be, and I can’t do anything to stop it, but I will confront it. "
"Being told by my college advisor, at the time, who is also the dean of my chosen college that I should “choose a major that was up to my level”. After I told him I have disabilities and, showing him my transcripts that displayed my 3.4 cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale. After that incident, I found a new major that puts me on the fast track for my field. This opportunity opened up a door where I was accepted into the National Student Exchange which is a nation wide registry for students to exchange with another from a different college for higher education and experiences. In addition that, I earned an internship with a prestigious workplace in my field with no help from my former advisor. I’m glad I was able to prove that he is wrong. "

Among them, “don’t stand like that” when I was standing with my hands behind my back and chest protruding (a good look at my breast wipes away any doubt on what was intended) and “I would eat her like a bag of crisps”. I barely know this person, I did nothing to signal I was open to this sort of comments which I would have found annoying in a bar, but seem gross on the workplace.

"Iâ€™m a female worker on a mine site in Australia, and one of only a handful of females on the site every day, compared to the hundreds of male workers, and I am more than ten years younger than everyone else in my immediate team. Every single day involves a constant barrage of sexism. I could go on forever, but for this post Iâ€™ll only list the things that have happened at work in the past week or so. A male co-worker said that women shouldnâ€™t be allowed on the front lines of the military because â€œtheyâ€™re a f***ing liabilityâ€?. When I challenged this statement, he became aggressive, and raised his voice. The same person later wore a t-shirt which said â€˜your girlfriendâ€™, accompanied by the â€˜femaleâ€™ icon (like on bathroom doors) and â€˜my girlfriendâ€™, accompanied by a silhouette of a woman spreading her legs and bending over. While wearing this shirt, he was reading the book Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus. I strongly dislike that book for multiple reasons, but I wonder if he had any awareness of how the combination of that t-shirt with a book about how to understand women comes across to other people. I expressed my amusement to another male co-worker, suggesting that if you want to understand women, maybe you should just talk to them. His response was, â€œtheyâ€™ll just f***ing lie to youâ€?. Later on, the t-shirt guy was watching a youtube video about how women are â€˜hardwiredâ€™ to be attracted to narcissistic men. I was hoping he would ask me how that was going for me, since Iâ€™m female and not heterosexual. But he didnâ€™t. Another male co-worker muttered under his breath â€œshow us your titsâ€? after a female worker walked out of earshot from his desk. If a female worker walks past who is considered unattractive, a senior colleague casually remarks to whoeverâ€™s around â€˜geez, if you woke up next to that, youâ€™d have to shoot itâ€™. A while ago, another male worker remarked about a female worker â€˜Iâ€™d rather be hanginâ€™ outa that than me truck windowâ€™. Almost every day, I witness a male worker blatantly staring at women walking past them and making sexual comments. During a shift, I went to talk to another male co-worker and saw that he was watching a video on youtube called â€œ(male name) SCHOOLS DUMB FEMENISTâ€?. I asked him what it was about and he said that it was about how the gender pay gap is a fallacy. I gave him a couple of specific examples where this was not the case, but his reasoning was that all consequences have actions, and when anyone starts work, they voluntarily sign a contract for a specified rate of pay, so if they didnâ€™t like it, they wouldnâ€™t sign it, and if a woman signs a contract for low paying job, itâ€™s her own fault. Similarly, if a woman canâ€™t negotiate a better pay rate, itâ€™s also her own fault. I couldnâ€™t bring myself to continue the conversation, so I left. A group of four male co-workers were discussing how women are taking over the world now, and how women now want everything for themselves. A comment is made along the lines of â€˜men now are being made to pay for what their ancestors did because they didnâ€™t treat women nicelyâ€™. Apparently their own sexist views and behaviours are a complete mystery to them. Theyâ€™ve regularly tried to convince me that straight, white, middle class men are the most discriminated against group of people in the world. The fact that I canâ€™t marry my partner and am still denied a lot of associated legal rights in Australia right now is apparently completely irrelevant. As is all other rational and logical thought on the subject. A senior colleague openly admits to â€˜usingâ€™ prostitutes in foreign countries. He calls this his â€˜humanitarian workâ€™ because heâ€™s supposedly supporting single mothers and giving them the means to pay for their childrenâ€™s schooling. He also regularly brags about â€œstacking them five highâ€? and taking them to breakfast wearing their outfits from the previous night for the sole purpose of making married men jealous. A male co-worker was complaining about the caliber of people he had to work with, calling them â€˜weeping vaginasâ€™. Another male co-worker agreed, stating they â€˜have sand in their vaginasâ€™. The constant barrage of sexist comments was really getting to me one day, so I asked a female worker if she had experienced the same thing in this workplace. Her reply was that it is constant. She told me about one incident that was particularly memorable, and it was in a lunch room, where a group of men were looking at pornographic images. One man held two images up, and asked the entire group, â€˜which pussy would taste better?â€™ with multiple men engaging in the discussion. The story about the study of sexual assaults on Australian university campuses was on the news, and a senior colleague remarked, â€˜that must be from all the ones who arenâ€™t getting enough cockâ€™. One of the other men present laughed, and none of the other men there said anything at all. I really wanted to say something, but I was too angry to be articulate. I wish I did say something at the time, but I doubt it wouldâ€™ve made any difference to them thinking itâ€™s acceptable to joke about sexual assault. It might have meant that they just wouldnâ€™t say things like that around me anymore, but at this point, I feel like even that small outcome would be enough. I could have brought up parts of my own upbringing and my partnerâ€™s experiences with sexual assault and domestic violence. I could have asked them how many cocks I would have to miss out on before I was justifiably a target for rape. But I didnâ€™t have the presence of mind. Iâ€™ve tried so many times to challenge their sexist (and racist, homophobic, islamophobic) views and comments with civilised conversation, and I have never been able to get a good outcome. Iâ€™ve walked away plenty of times. Several times, my challenges have been met with anger and aggression, and often result in multiple male workers rallying together to shut down what Iâ€™m trying to say. Only twice have I ever received support from a male colleague that was more than just the smug comment â€˜everyoneâ€™s entitled to their opinionâ€™. I want to find ways that I can fight this kind of sexism that happens every day, but it is SO difficult when the majority of men I try to discuss this with seem SO adamant that women are causing so many problems. I want to keep trying, but sometimes Iâ€™m just exhausted, and all I feel I can do is try to isolate myself from them as much as possible. "
Sometime into my PhD I had a conversation with my primary supervisor where I asked him to allow me to live and work remotely from the university I was enrolled at (something we had originally agreed that I could do when I accepted the position). During the conversation I was told that I was being “emotional” and that “I needed to go home to my parents for a bit to get grounded”. Somehow I can’t see those same statements bwing made to a male student. 
"This was a group of electricians in my home. I hear a discussion about dust, and one man calls the other a ‘little girl’, and that he is just like the tenants for moaning about the dust.

I say ‘oh yes, all women are the same, we are all ninnies’. He shuts up at this point. When he leaves he calls me darling. This man is less than half my age. "

"I’ve had my discussions of sexual harassment laughed off by guys – how do you explain that fear to those who have never experienced it? Girls and women are subjected to harassment on a shockingly regular basis. I was undressed and “played with” by older boys when I was 4. I was crotch grabbed by a teenage boy when I was 8 and that same boy tried to offer me money to undress for him. I was cornered by a group of older boys when I was 10 who grabbed at me and cuffed me on the head as I ran for freedom. I was made to feel afraid on several occasions when walking along the street and men followed me in a car, calling obscenities out. I was cornered and touched by a 12 year old boy when I was 14, and told I was a slut as he sauntered away. When I was 13 I was told by a group of teenage boys that I was ugly and not worth anything. I have been followed along dark streets and found myself thinking I’m going to be attacked, and my heart rate went through the roof and I felt myself starting to panic. I have stood behind a male friend for protection when another man wouldn’t take no for an answer. I have been in workplaces where the men talked to my chest and proudly displayed their pornographic wall decorations. I’ve even been to a house for sale and was leered at by the real estate agent when he showed me to a room covered with porn pictures. The cat-calling by tradies as you walk past, the sexist comments by male workmates or aquaintances, the ‘look up and down’ my daughter got at 10 years old from my husband’s boss, the leer my daughter kept getting at 9 years old from a ‘friend’, the sexually suggestive comments from a ‘friend’ aimed at my daughter when she was 4.

"I was shocked, disgusted and yet, unsuprised to learn that Laura Bates now receives regular death and rape threats since beginning this project. What is it that’s so threatening about people wanting equality? Why is it that peaceful actions often provoke a violent response? I am 33 years old and have worked in multiple jobs, in multiple countries, since I was 16. All up, I’d say I’ve probably worked with 12 different companies. Yet my current job is the first I’ve had where the upper management is entirely female and women aren’t penalised if they (heaven forbid) have a family. I’m no statistician but even I recognise that that ratio is messed up. Early on in my working life I heard women who stood up against sexism being called ‘bitches’, ‘stupid’, ‘mentally un-hinged’ or being told that that they were taking themselves too seriously and needed to ‘lighten up’. I’ve had male managers that would ask me to sit on their knee, try to give me “massages” I didn’t want and be forced to listen to hundred of jokes relating to rape, domestic violence and women’s “F*ckability”. I also know of people who won’t hire women or give a woman a promotion if they have or want to have children as it’s “investing in deadwood”. It’s pretty draining and sadly, it conditioned me to expect that sort of behaviour as the norm. It’s only now, when I work in an environment devoid of sexism, where women bringing their babies into work is commonplace that I’m beginning to get angry at the absolute contrast between my very inclusive workplace and all my past experiences. I’m disgusted that our society has become so blind and complacent about women’s rights (aka EQUAL rights) and am determined to challenge sexist behaviour in future. Even if this makes things awkward sometimes. I recently discussed the Everyday Sexism project with a group of friends at uni. Hearing their tales of discrimination, which were so similar to my own, made me realise that the issue is so much larger than my personal experience. Sexist behaviour occurs all the time and it’s unacceptable. Thank you Laura, I’m so happy that this project exists to help shine a light on all the inequity that still occurs. "

I am a senior member of the team who used to make strategic decisions and was respected as being somebody delivered quality work. Since he arrived he has insidiously undermined and eroded my role and now he tells people my main strength is that of a good organiser! All women in the team say they have experienced the same thing. We have complained to our university employers (located in the south west of England and which prides itself on being an equal opportunities employer),to senior management and to HR but it is so difficult to prove what he is doing that nothing comes of our complaints. It took me a long time to acknowledge that this is really what was happening to us, I really didn’t believe relatively young men behaved that way in the 21st century! "
"I went to a work presentation today with the director (a man in his 50s) giving a talk on workplace safety. He started off with saying that he spent some time looking for youtube videos on the subject, and he found some really good ones from the 70s and 80s, but could not show them, as you wouldn’t believe how sexist they were in those days. Great I thought! Then he played the video he had chosen, some comedy rap from Malaysia. And one of the first scenes was of a man working on a building site, taking his eyes off the hammer to check out a young woman walking past in a maid??? costume with a very short skirt – to the tag line “concentrate, don’t be looking at the pretty young maid”. Wonderful! "
"I was in a cab with a Director from work this morning making small talk. The discussion moved to books, and then to Harry Potter. He instantly commented that the books were fine, but that Quidditch was a game “clearly invented by somebody who doesn’t understand sport”. After a few minutes of joking about the rules, he ended with the line: “I mean, you can tell she didn’t have a man in her life when she wrote that”. Because obviously (a) women don’t understand sport and (b) female authors need men to sense check their writing. As ever, I wish my surprise hadn’t left me completely unable to respond. "
"At a work event that I attended with the president of my company, the (male) guest of honor turns to me and thanks me for “keeping [president of company] on a leash,” the implication being that I am the president’s assistant. I am not even remotely his assistant and nothing about my actions suggested I was. I walked away feeling belittled and asking myself, “Maybe I need to wear more makeup or buy a better suit?” as if looking older or dressing in more expensive attire would somehow fix the assumption that because I’m a woman I’m someone’s assistant. "
"I post this as an entirely hypothetical situation. It’s like a story, fictional, invented. It certainly never happened to me. And certainly not at my workplace. You begin a new job. Within days, a creeping feeling gnaws at your extremities, as your (older, male) boss describes to you the curvaceous figure of his sister-in-law, complete with exaggerated hand gestures cupping her breasts and stroking her hips. A few weeks later, it’s your wedding anniversary. In front of the whole office, your boss refers graphically to your sex life, and what you’ll get up to that night. You bloom scarlet. A few months pass, during which, your boss does the following – repeatedly refers to younger female staff as ‘kiddo’, ‘sweetheart’ or ‘sunshine’ – Hires a lovely, but totally unqualified young woman, then proceeds to make numerous comments about her figure and sex life. – Said young woman wishes to purchase an expensive bike but isn’t sure her partner will approve of the large expense. Boss suggests she “go to Victoria’s Secrets, put on some tiny, sexy lingerie, and get on the bike. Bet you he’ll want to buy it then.” – One staff member was introduced to another employee as â€˜cute and prettyâ€™. – In a staff meeting, the breasts of another staff member were discussed. – A staff member changing into workout gear in her closed office is told she’s putting on a strip show for the neighbours, and should open her door so the rest of us can see – Sexist jokes are shared, and female staff receive unwanted attention and intrusion into their personal lives. – The n-word is used in front of a black employee Over time, the gnawing feeling evolves into deep unhappiness and a lead weight settles on your shoulders. But you’re new. So you don’t know what to do. There’s no one you trust at work to discuss it with. But you know this isn’t right. There’s a formal grievance procedure in the handbook, but you’re acutely aware of your precarious position. You don’t want to rock the boat. After all, he’s not groping you, so maybe you just can’t take a joke. Eventually, this feeling will be scrubbed away by repeated attempts to ignore you. You grow immune to being told you’re a pain in the backside, and why don’t you get a sense of humour. You stop caring. But back to then. You tentatively call HR with a hypothetical situation. You’re testing the waters. HR admits the scenario you’ve outlined would indeed be unacceptable. But indicates they “don’t want to take this too seriously”. Apparently, the boss’s manager will have a discrete chat with the offender. You’re never clear whether this is actually done. The harassment continues unabated. Over another six months, your concerns are reported in various ways, increasing in volume and strength, yet little action is taken. The concerns are always acknowledged as correct and valid. Nobody seems surprised to hear them, yet no significant action is taken. So you reach boiling point. And compose an epic, four page formal grievance, which you send directly to the CEO. To her credit, the CEO calls you immediately to apologise, to make you aware she never knew (you believe her), and to order an investigation. The investigation begins, and after several months, the boss is found to have breached the Code of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act. However, it is decided not to discipline him. Because apparently, he wasn’t quite aware of how unacceptable his actions were. Instead, the female staff who came forward after the complaint (the floodgates opened, and once an independent investigator was hired, miraculously, a dozen women felt safe enough to share their stories) were told the suspended boss would return to work as usual. And they were to assist in his reintegration. They were to support their harasser and were forbidden from making any reference to his behavior. The past is the past, you know. We can’t hold grudges. And disciplinary action could be taken if you can’t get along. The employee who filed the original complaint was previously in the process of being promoted. That promotion was agreed in principle prior to the complaint. You then take maternity leave, with the promotion to come into effect upon your return to work. You later negotiate terms and conditions. You “lean in” and push for extra pay and vacation. You win, and a formal offer letter follows. You start your new role after maternity leave, but funnily enough, find that many your previous responsibilities have disappeared. You no longer manage the staff you previously oversaw, for example. But your new pay level, title and vacation are enacted, as agreed. Except two months later, your HR advisor briefly mentions they won’t be honouring your extra vacation entitlement. Apparently, you were too “pushy” during the negotiations. So sorry about that. After veiled threats of legal action (the basics of contract law appear to have eluded your Head of HR), they back down. But only after saying that you negotiated too hard, and didn’t deserve the extra pay or improved conditions. And threatening to sue you if you revealed the terms or conditions of your employment. You are now persona non grata at work. You are the trouble-maker. You wonder if stripping your responsibilities was punishment for the sexual harassment complaint. Or for the fact you took maternity leave and may do again in the next few years. You wonder what would have happened if you’d not threatened legal action. You wonder, if ‘lean in’ doesn’t even work for the privileged white women it’s supposed to help, then what’s the bloody point? You amuse yourself by imagining the horror if you sent out a organization-wide call for unionization. You wonder how an organization that supposedly campaigns for social justice can treat its own staff in this way. You consider writing a post about it all, but you aren’t sure you’ll ever publish it. Then you think, what the hell. It’s all hypothetical anyway. This is just a story. Made up. Invented. Totally not real. "
In my first one to one with my skip level director of a global top 20 brand we realise we both have twin girls. His are older than mine by about 10 years. We joke a bit about how hard it is managing twins especially when they are younger. I ask if his wife also works. He’s says she used to but gave up “because we wanted to raise them ourselves”. I was so surprised I didn’t say anything. 
"I went for an interview for a job for which I was abundantly qualified. I was the only woman in a group of ten or so. One of the interview questions was: “You are stranded on a desert island with the following items: tarpaulin, mirror, bottle…” etc., and as a group we were asked to work out, under observation by the interviewers, how we would survive. My male teammates all sat in abject silence, staring abashedly at their pads. After a minute or two I started to organise the group’s response: “OK, well I think the first thing we’ll need is the bottle – what does everyone else think? I’ll just write bottle for now, we can come back to it. Pete, what are your thoughts?” The question was answered satisfactorily, but I didn’t get the job. When I asked for feedback, I was told that I was rejected because I was ‘domineering’. "

"I work for a large engineering company of approximately 2000 employees, (and part of a group of such companies which employs over 40,000 people world-wide). I’m an engineer and department manager. Fewer than 5% of managers are female. Today in a meeting, our on-site head of HR was outlining things they are doing to attract children and teenagers to careers in engineering. One of these things is to donate a technical tool kit to local primary schools, and work with them on a project where the kids explain this stuff to Kindergarten children. Wow. I appreciate that our company is prepared to make that much effort that early with the aim of recruiting kids later. Then he says this: “it’s a shame there are so few male kindergarten teachers”. Implication: if the kindergarten teacher presenting the toolbox was male, there’d be a better response to it, or he’d make a better job of it. In this one throw-away remark, the HR manager of a large engineering company reinforced the stereotype that women do not make good role models for engineers. What is a female engineer considering a career in management in that company supposed to think? Or a male employee faced with a female supervisor? When challenged, he of course said that women made good engineers, and that more and more are joining the company and performing well. I’m sure the remark was spontaneous and not thought through. But that’s the point: it’s these latent, unconscious beliefs which lead to disadvantages for women in the workplace. And by the way: of course it’s a shame that there are so few male kindergarten teachers, but not because they’re the only ones capable of teaching certain subjects! "

I was trying to get past them however they would not move and one of them told me to “smile” while another shouted “cheer up” and was met with laughter from the other men, some of whom I would have considered friends and some who constantly treat me with disrespect (e.g. Calling me “woman” in the workplace instead of my name.)

I was shocked. I told him flat out that I was crying over it, and that it was NOT a breakdown. "
"I am a server and was working one night when two middle-aged men (I specify age here because I am 21, the age gap making the encounter even more infuriating/disgusting) came in and sat in my section. Within 5 minutes of serving them, I realized they were completely drunk, told my manager, and we agreed to cut them off if they ordered anymore alcohol. The whole situation was unusual because I work at a mid-to-high range sit-down restaurant, and had almost never had to cut anyone off in the 3 years I’d been there– it was not the kind of place you got drunk. The comments started small- saying their night was better “because you’re here” (serving them) and making comments like “you’re beautiful, you know that?” Every now and then (very rarely, thank God) I have to serve a middle-aged man who makes these sorts of comments and proceeds to eye me up all night, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The comments started to escalate; “beautiful” turned into “sexy,” confirming that they had been sexualizing me from the moment I started serving them. I was asked multiple times if I was married, if I had a boyfriend (yes), which did not deter them. Thankfully, they were leaving shortly and wanted their bills. I was frankly terrified to bill them because I would be forced to stand at the table for several minutes with no escape. In hindsight, I should have gotten someone else to take payment– I should never have to feel uncomfortable at work. I brought the bills and waited while one of the men whipped out some cash. He placed some money on the table and asked, “Would you like another $20?” I responded, “That is completely up to you, sir.” He then said, “How about we go outside and talk about it?” The implication that he would pay me for–presumably–sexual favours was fairly obvious, especially considering the escalating comments and lecherous stares. I simply said/yelled “NOOOOOOO I don’t think so” and walked away as he said “Jeez, I was just kidding” in an offended tone. I waited until he had left to clear his table, and saw that his glass was broken- according to the table next to him, he had smashed it. As I was cleaning up the glass I looked around and saw he was coming back, which was terrifying. He shouted “Hey YOU! COME HERE” at me from about 20 feet away. I froze, and he came up quick- he threw a $20 at me, which I snatched, glaring at him, and quickly walked away (I thought about throwing it back out of principle, but the thought of having been through all that bullshit AND having to tip out of pocket on the bill convinced me to keep it). I got a bit of smug satisfaction when one of my friends hosting said that guy loudly complained, “‘I tipped her $20 and she didn’t even thank me!'” as he walked out the door. While this was an extreme case of sexism, I have received a ton of harassment and sexism working in the service industry especially. Men take advantage of the power position in which it is your job to facilitate a good experience for them to make inappropriate comments that would otherwise end that interaction. Normally, if a man said something about my appearance on the street, I would ignore him. In this situation, my choices are fairly limited by the fact that I must serve them for the next two hours. Although I warned my manager about the situation and kept her updated on the sexism, she agreed (when it was just comments about my appearance, i.e. ‘beautiful’) that it was something we (female servers) had to put up with every now and then. Of course after telling her about the final encounter when paying the bill, she assured me that if we recognized him again he’d be thrown out. This isn’t the first or the last time I’ll encounter sexism in the workplace– thankfully, besides this incident, it usually involves comments that are not blatantly offensive/degrading/disgusting. I would still prefer it if men my father’s age would stop saying the following: -“You should come join us for a drink when you’re done” (usually said jokingly-but not jokingly by groups of 2-3 middle-aged men) -“You have really pretty eyes. Come closer so I can see them.” -“Do you work out? You look like you work out.” No, sir, I do not want to join you. I would like to know how you like your steak, and that is all. "
"I was working for a construction company which was in the process of hiring staff for a new project. The office was small and open planned – I was the only woman in a room of 5 men.The project lead started discussing up coming interviews and said that on the coming Tuesday they were going to interview a woman for a particular role – I cannot remember the exact title. During this discussion, one of the men in the room interrupted the project lead and said that they shouldn’t interview a woman for that type of role because “Don’t you know that ladies don’t like small spaces and she’s going to have to climb in and out of piping and holes”. My jaw was on the floor! Thankfully, within 30 seconds the project lead, who was a man, responded that he had hired plenty of women for that type of role and never had any issues of that nature before. I was new to the team and said nothing but I very much regret not speaking-up in defence of my own kind. "
"For my boyfriendâ€™s leaving do his property agent work colleagues took him out to a strip club. I found out because he boasted about it on Facebook. Early in our relationship I had understood vaguely from him that this sort of outing is common among property types, but I had made it clear to him that I was deeply uncomfortable with the entire concept of strip clubs, and had thought that he respected me enough not to go to them if he wanted to be with me. I brought the subject up the next time I saw him, which was in a bar with more Edinburgh property friends. His best friendâ€™s fiancÃ©e verbally attacked me, claiming that it was par for the course in their industry, that until worked in property I could have no idea how â€˜essentialâ€™ were the regular â€˜businessâ€™ meetings at strip clubs, or of the pressure my boyfriend was under to conform to these habits, and that personally she was â€˜secure enough as a womanâ€™ not to have a problem with it. I was astonished by the aggression, vehemence and snideness of her manner â€“ I can only guess at some suppressed discomfort at going along with these outings herself on a professional level (or more likely, at going along with this behaviour in her fiance). Since when did somethingâ€™s being an established custom, automatically make it right? I was particularly disappointed in my boyfriend â€“ I canâ€™t respect someone who succumbs to peer pressure so easily and who moves happily in such a tawdry, seedy circle. Needless to say our relationship will shortly be at an end. Whatever the experience of strip club workers, it canâ€™t be denied that there are ramifications for other women. I believe that ordinary men viewing women in these contexts feeds into objectification on the streets and in the workplace as well as the â€˜pornificationâ€™ of sexual expectations which has become so widespread. In a work setting it is beyond inappropriate. "
"I am a HR Officer at a manufacturing plant. I was about to go out onto the shop floor with a manager. He said to me “you haven’t got your safety boots on” I said “I don’t need them in the area we are going as we are not going beyond the yellow lines” (we do not need to wear them unless over the yellow line). He then proceeded to say “oh please wear them, I never get any excitement, you look sexy in them and they make your bum wobble”. "
"During a discussion at work, my opinion clashed with my line manager’s. When he ran out of additional arguments to present he simply said, “I feel sorry for your husband… you must be a nightmare to argue with at home.” "
"In a workplace where I was the manager, the three owners would be in the bar on a Friday afternoon with a large contingent of male friends drinking copious amounts of alcohol would verbally and physically harass the female bar staff (ranging from 17 – 26) lots of very rude and nasty comments, inappropriate touching without consent etc. I would often interject indirectly by sending members of staff on errands. But numerous times I directly interfered with the interaction by objecting the behaviour verbally or even creating a physical barrier with my own body. Sometimes to only have the attention turned onto myself which often ended in a very curt conversation. My bosses would either blank the behaviour from their mates or join in. One of these bosses bit my bottom while I was changing the projector. I was threatened with the loss of my job on numerous occasions for disapproving of this ‘boyish good fun’. It got to the point of having to shuffle the roster to give female staff a break and staff quitting. On the other side, I had several serious complaints about the other female manager and her very inappropriate behaviour towards the male staff. And that was just one workplace. It happens in every place I’ve worked but also in social situations and even private ones. I’ve had a stranger walk up behind me as put his hand up my skirt, grabbed a bottom cheek and my vagina. When I violently rejected such unwanted touching, he threw the glass at my face, shouting obscenities…. And that’s just one incident. "
"My colleague who is above me but not direct boss at work started to ask me if and when I was going to have a child and that his cousin had a child on her own at a later age so I can do so as well. This was out of context to our general conversation and not solicited at all. This person is in the top 1% of income. The comments from my colleague escalated to after a meeting with a male client who is the same race as I am that I should marry that male client because we are the same race. This was again unsolicited. When I asked my colleague how to make more money, he told me to marry to make money. Specifically, he told me to marry older men for their social security and how I can marry a few of them in a row. He said that many women such as myself with a graduate degree from a top school marry richer men and then don’t work. He has asked me repeatedly what I would do if I did not work. This is not what I think about much because I would like to work and enjoy my work. The last comment he made to me was that I no younger man would marry me because they wanted to have kids and that is the purpose of marriage. They will marry younger women to have children. All of this was said to me at work in his office while I was actually trying to work, unsolicited. "

They are not jokes, not teases – these are examples of sickeningly prevalent (benevolent) sexism. "
"I’ve been turned down for more than one job I was qualified for because of my sex, childbearing age, and often because of my physical appearance. That was when their questions didn’t bother to hide the fact. I am a normal, healthy weight but don’t wear makeup. Once I’ve gotten over that hurdle, there’s the endemic workplace sexism. Before anything, I know I will have do everything in my power to make sure I can afford to litigate – just in case I am threatened with dismissal for complaining. "
A guy at my old workplace (Debenhams birmingham) constantly follows women into cupboards and stockrooms to get ‘alone’ time with them and then proceeds to just try and feel them up.

"When I first joined that company in financial services in Canary Wharf, the first thing that I noticed was the fake plastic tits on the desk of one of the male bosses, the second thing was that a female boss sat right next to him and did not seem to mind!? That says it all about my experience there: a sexist world made of 80% men, where women, the minority, let that happen, even as bosses, they never demanded more respect, respect of basic civil manners. How shocking coming from women who have education and money. This is why sexism is so widespread: nobody fights against it, even women in high positions, they just accept it, go through it, go with it. My 1+year there is just a combination of feelings varying from disgust to nearly daily humiliation, that lead me to protect myself. My direct team leader spent his time sabotaging successful women only, by describing them as flirty, whereas they were not, that was the only way he found to express his jealousy and no one ever stopped him. One day working late at night, left with only one of my male colleagues, suddenly, when I was about to leave and go for a week holiday, he came to me and touched my buttocks. I was shocked, I never expected it, never experienced that before, I did not know what to do, so I just left. Another female colleague was there and witnessed the event, just to look down at me!, what an awful reaction, she did nothing nor to help me neither to support me. So I just left quickly and tried to forget about it, and never mentioned it to anyone, particularly not to my sexist boss, who I guessed would have turned the event against me. Other few have had a bad behavior towards me during my time there, like being too close to me, or throwing papers or elastic bands at me, or even one guy shouting at me. It is the only time I saw people behaving like that, they were spread on 2 teams, about 12 people, who had just no rules, and I had no protection from the team leader, it actually came from him, he fostered those attitudes against women and let them do, just saying (as another female team leader there told me too) that it was banter, that they did not mean bad. Oh god, I am so glad I got the strength to eventually broke free from them and leave. It took me several months to recover and heal from the trauma of that awful experience, regaining self-esteem and self-confidence, it has been so long, but now I can feel I have healed. I do not want that awful experience to break me, I want to overcome it and get my life running again. I tell my story because I would like other women, especially young ones about to choose their future career to think twice about working in financial services in London, sexism is widespread, it is what weak men use against women, and do not expect solidarity from most women in there. There are other fields that are interesting and not fueled with sexism, go for them! "

They were always happy to oblige and I never saw her requests refused. A positive story for your website ….

"So two incidents have occurred in the last 24 hours. First I was walking home last night and this guy walking in the opposite direction stuck his arm out, put it near my crotch and said ‘Come on just put it here baby’. Shocked, I brushed past him and continued walking which he responded to by screaming ‘Bitch!’. The saddest thing for me was that there was a couple nearby, who had witnessed all of this and they just continued chatting and laughing as though nothing has happened, as though it was completely normal. Then I had a meeting today with a client which he wanted to end with a hug as opposed to a handshake. When i asked my male colleague if he had tried to hug him in their previous meeting, he said ‘No, but I’m not very huggable’. "

"One of my biggest concerns is sexism against women by women, particularly in the workplace. Recently I was part of a discussion with three older female managers who don’t have children. Two of the women said that they wouldn’t hire a woman of childbearing years or a mum if they had the choice of an equally qualified man, because the woman may need to take time off due to her children. Today I became aware of a female manager using an argument I experienced 15+ years ago; her justification for paying a male employee more than an equally qualified female employee was that he was the primary breadwinner in his family. The argument was flawed, because the female employee was also the primary breadwinner in her family. The manager stood her ground. I don’t know that any of these women realised their comments were discriminatory, which makes it even worse. How can we expect to achieve equality if we’re not even supporting each other? "
"I recently graduated from a Phlebotomy program in a city that is referred to as “the healthcare capital”. I was shocked when my instructor (a female) openly told the class that even in a female-dominated workplace like our clinical sites, that female directors were twice as likely to pick a male student over a female every time (regardless of qualifications). The reason she gave is that “too much estrogen makes for a catty work environment” and that “you just need a man to mellow all the women out”. "

Barring one or two minor car-bicycle collisions over the last decade, this is the worst cycling experience I’ve ever had and the most danger I’ve ever felt I’ve been in over the last fifteen years of commuting. If it weren’t for fear of repercussions, I’d got back and give them a piece of my mind (as a cyclist and a feminist). When there is no workplace, how/where do you report ‘casual’ harassment? "

"I worked in McDonalds when I was 17/18 and the shift managers (middle-aged men) used to stand very unnecessarily close behind me making physical contact, and touch/stroke my shoulders,back and arms needlessly whenever they passed me or were talking to me/ giving me something. It was the majority of the male shift managers who did this, and they did it to most if not all of the girls and younger women working there. My brother was also a shift manager (we rarely worked together) and I told him about it and he must have threatened them because they suddenly stopped, and became very apologetic if they brushed against me. It is not ok that the only reason they stopped is because I had a man protecting me, which none of the other girls and women had. "

Sexism is alive and well in the US Workplace, it has never gone away. No amount of laws can really make it stop. "
"The subject of Tim Burtonâ€™s â€œBig Eyes,â€? Margaret Keane was the painter who created â€œthe big-eyed waifsâ€? â€” pieces of art that became wildly popular in the 1960s. Her husband, Walter Keane, convinced her that they would make more money if he put his name on the paintings. Years later, she claimed in court that he threatened to kill her if she ever went public with their secret. Eventually, Margaret divorced her husband and told a radio host the truth in a 1970 interview. She challenged Walter to a live painting contest to prove she was really the artist; he didnâ€™t respond. Then, in 1986, she took him to court. According to a People Magazine article at the time: â€œMargaret, 58, and Walter, 70, hadnâ€™t laid eyes on each other for nearly 20 years when they walked into federal court in Honolulu last month. They proceeded to have at it in an often heated 3Â½-week trial. Margaret acknowledged that she had gone along with Walterâ€™s claims during their marriage, but only because he threatened to kill her and her daughter by a prior marriage if she revealed the truth. At the behest of her attorney, Margaret sat before the jurors and in 53 minutes painted a small boyâ€™s face with those unmistakable outsize orbs. The painting, Exhibit 224 of the trial, may be her greatest artistic triumph.â€? "
"Today at work I was doing shopback, and I entered an aisle that was empty except for one woman. I thought I’d be safe from harassment there… NOPE. An old man entered, and IMMEDIATELY shouted at me, “You just like walking all around the store, don’t you?” teasing me. I set off my personal alarm to try to startle him, but he just laughed. All I could do then was call him an idiot and tell him to go to hell before walking away. I wish I’d kicked him hard! Even if it would have lost me my job. I am getting less and less tolerant of this every time it happens. I guess that’s a good thing because it should NEVER be tolerated even once. I DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TEASED BY RANDOM MEN JUST FOR DOING MY JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m seriously considering quitting this horrible company. "

"A guy at work calls our support team the ‘admin girls’. The team is women aged 35-60. When I told him they weren’t girls he complained saying ‘oh come on, I’m not allowed to say anything’. He doesn’t realise how patronising and undermining that is. "
"Apparently, me being invited to give advice to Government was considered less important than an internal news story about the correct way to dispose of agar (not down the sink apparently) by our news team. When a male colleague was then subsequently invited to also join (on my recommendation to the parliamentary team) it made it to the front page of our external website. I am now measuring my worth alongside powdered seaweed, as apparently I don’t even make it on to the same scale as my male colleagues! "
"I am a lawyer and I used to work at an international justice organisation, where I had to prepare all my advice in French. My head of department, an old French man, would check the contributions from the non-francophone lawyers.

"I am feeling battered. Today I had the experience of being â€œdepersonalizedâ€? by a man who I work with in a way that I havenâ€™t experienced before. We are peers â€“ equal roles on opposite sides of the client / provider fence and weâ€™ve had some frustrations in the recent past. These are largely due to the enormous stress we both face on our respective sides of the work weâ€™re engaged with : big teams, politics, shifting demands, challenged decision-making and so onâ€¦ I feel frustrated because he operates from a single base and doesnâ€™t seem to appreciate that it is extremely hard for me to â€œjust pop inâ€? to his office for a chat whenever thereâ€™s an issue â€“ Getting there takes an hour from where I engage with my team to get the work done. He is also oblivious to style he uses to engage with me, which is very directive ; his tone implies â€“ most of the time â€“ that he is actually not interested in hearing my point of view. This means that his expressed desire for me to â€œjust come and chatâ€? is undermined by his manner; what comes across implicitly is â€œcome here so I can shut you downâ€?, and needless to say I am reluctant to do that more often than necessary. He is frustrated by me because being bossed around tends to rub me up the wrong way and at times I respond quite vehemently (surprise!) â€“ particularly when I believe there may be a better way of doing things, or that there are things heâ€™s failing to consider. He is a man who is used to being the Head Honcho, and he doesnâ€™t like being challenged. Up to now I have managed to absorb what I believe to be increasingly personal levels of criticism, but yesterday â€“ at our clientâ€™s request â€“ I posed a question by email to another team who are themselves facing pressure. It was a very simple question â€“ I just needed informationâ€¦ and as I say, I was asking on behalf of our client, but the person who responded was obviously anxious about the context in which it was asked. They copied in their superior, and the man in question above, expressing a concern that I might be about to push work in their direction. I quickly explained this was not the case, providing a short but direct explanation, and assumed the matter was settled. On turning on my laptop today, however, I found an email that disturbed me profoundly â€“â€“ and I am at a bit of a loss as to how to how to deal with it. He has emailed the person to whom I posed my original question, saying â€œwe are having some difficulties with this person and her method of comms. Apologies.â€? Iâ€™m not sure quite which part of this has me more enraged or upsetâ€¦.. â€¢ The fact that he has the audacity to interfere in this exchange in the first place, completely ignoring the context I had subsequently provided, which I believe had resolved the concernâ€¦. â€¢ The fact that he has copied in a still wider audienceâ€¦. â€¢ Or the fact that he has referred to me as â€œthis person.â€? On the whole I think it is the last item that has me the most freaked out. I am copied in on the damn email after all!! WTF is up with referring to someone in the third person like that? The way it feels is that it is a way of trying to depersonalize me â€“ the woman who he is finding hard to control. It feels like an attempt to â€œput me in my placeâ€? in exactly the same way that a drunk in a pub might refer to a woman whoâ€™d rejected his advances as â€œthat slut.â€? My emotional response to being both publically undermined and depersonalized in a two line email is the same gut-wrenching feeling that I have experienced when being sexually harassed (which happens a lot more often to ALL women than most men might think.) If I had a partner to discuss this with I would, but in the absence of that I am putting this out there as a way of taking the burn out of it. "

"Im a support worker working in residential care and a male colleague recently told me that I’d make a wonderful house wife. I was making a pot of soup at the time and cleaning the kitchen. I didn’t think anything of it at the time. I generally get on with this colleague and have got used to his passing comments praising me for being ‘lovely’ or ‘sweet’ but suddenly I realised that I felt so angry and upset that he is constantly undermining me. I now feel that I need to prove myself and remind this man that I’m an ambitious person and while I would like to get married one day this is not my goal in life! I’m also upset that in this line of work women, such as myself support men with personal care while the male staff can only support men. Strikes me as sexist because I feel uncomfortable assisting men who might enjoy the attention from a woman like myself. "
"I had a job in a cafÃ© and bar and I was introducing a new colleague to the workspace and his tasks. When our boss walked in he would only speak to my colleague and ignore that I was there. He ended the conversation with the instruction for the day: “Daniel, there are not so many guests today because the weather is bad, so this will be a quite relaxed day for you. Helen is going to clean the bar today, so if you want, you might join her.” "
"Sexual harassment7 in the workplace: I was 17 and had just started working part time, whist a full time student at sixth form college. I was working at a local shop and about 4 shifts into work, the store had closed and I was on the â€˜closingâ€™ shift – I was cleaning the till area, as usual when I was called into the office by two males co-workers. One, being the store supervisor. I walked into the very tiny office where the two men were sitting and was told by my supervisor that he wanted to ask me a questionâ€¦ â€œa personal questionâ€? – I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it, so I let him ask. He told me that they had been discussing it and both had different opinions but that they wanted me to clarify. â€œAre you a virgin or not?â€? "
"During my internship, the boss was really kind of sexist without realising probably. He adressed me and the other female intern with cute names but he never did that with his male employees. We were working on some educational stuff for kids, and he had these great ideas about ‘girl planets’ and ‘boy planets’ *sarcastic eye roll*. One time he had a big delivery of paper that had to be carried up the stairs. I asked if I could help, he said “No, I need strong guys for that”. Oh there was the time I was asking for some tools at the school’s workshop and the guy working there kept talking to my friend, even though he only followed me because he had nothing better to do and he probably never even touched a hammer. When I mentioned the latter the guy tried to defend himself by saying, well but if he gets a girlfriend he has to know how to fix stuff right. (the friend has a boyfriend btw). But what made me really angry about female/male stereotypes was when I worked part-time at a kids toy store. I’ve seen a lot of boys being dragged away from the barbies and other ‘girly’ stuff by their parents, being told: “nonono, that’s for girls, not for you”. One boy could choose a present and he chose a playmobile camper. His mom then tried to talk him out of it for like 5 minutes, telling him “no the camper is for girls, you like the cool pirate ship better, right?” Luckily he kept saying he liked the camper the most, so in the end he got it. (like wth, that stuff is unisex as f*ck). Oh and when parents are looking for a blue version but we only have pink ones left. A guy asked “are these the only ones left? Because it’s for a boy” I replied “Well maybe he’d like a pink one” and then the guy laughed and said “luckily he doesn’t.” I do think that’s where it starts though. Little boys get told the barbies are something to be ashamed of, so they start to see girly stuff as less worthy. About sexual assault, I usually don’t get much ‘negative attention’ from guys, but one time when I went out with a friend at night. My friend just found out she likes girls so I promised to go to a lesbian bar with her. We got approached by multiple guys assuming we were both lesbian and also somehow into having a trio with a guy (yes, let the logic sink in.). I must say I have good hopes for the future though. Especially in films lately there has been a slow but steady improvement of female representation. I hope it keeps up and society changes for the better. "
"We are recruiting for a new position in my department. My boss handed me a pile of applications to sift through, looked me square in the eye and said “I don’t want any mothers!” (I am a mother). "
"When I was a teenager I had very large breasts. At my high school we had a fortnight of work experience in year 10. I walked to my temporary workplace, which was very near my school, every day. Now that I was wearing office-appropriate clothes rather than school uniform, I suddenly found that many drivers were beeping their horns at me as they passed me walking, which had never happened to me before. After I left school, but before I had a breast reduction operation at the age of 19, I experienced this regularly when I was walking in the street. As well as being beeped at I would regularly get men shouting greetings to me or making noises at me from cars and vans, and on a few occasions men who were passing by on foot on the other side of the street would shout to me or make gestures about my breasts. I mostly ignored it, but if what they were doing/saying was overtly sexual or obviously about my body I would usually stick two fingers up and tell them to f*** off. I wasn’t at all surprised to find that the beeping, comments and gestures from male strangers all stopped happening as soon as I had my breast reduction. "

"On the job for a British tourism agency in Australia, I had a supervisor who would repeatedly stick his hands in his pants when talking to me, make wildly inappropriate jokes, and had no shame that he preferred to hire hot young female interns. The other male supervisor repeatedly ignored this behavior. Our HR was overseas and his childhood best friend was the company owner, so I felt completely unable to report any of this without risking losing my position. There was absolutely no effective harassment policy in place and now I look for this kind of protection in the policies of every new workplace. "
I was advised to tone down how I dress in the workplace recently by another female if I want to get on. Cut my hair short to be more corporate and avoid wearing anything overtly feminine. I’m not sure I agree with the advice – it feels like conforming because of how others might wrongly perceive me. 
"So, while at school I experienced some serious hassle from one guy, who got a kick out of sexually harassing me. With hindsight, I am absolutely horrified by what he got away with, touching me, squeezing, and slapping, my chest and backside, constant verbal references to my genitalia and so on and so forth. We had never dated or anything, it was purely out of malice, and he knew it upset me, which is exactly why he did it. It went on for months. Then, one time, he slapped my backside, hard, in front of my then-boyfriend. The BF was absolutely livid, got the rest of the story out of me, and basically made me report this guy for sexual harassment to the school authorities, or he would drag me down to police station and make me do it there. It took him a while to get me to see that if this had taken place anywhere else, in the workplace for example, the police would have got involved (especially as I was under 18 at the time!) So, I finally went to the housemistress and told her that I was being sexually harassed. She sat me down and explained how serious this issue was, and that the guy could get into a lot of trouble, and did I really want to make a fuss over something this “minor”. Only the memory of my BF’s reaction stopped me from saying “okay, leave it”. So, I pressed on and told her everything, how he’d shoved his crotch in my face in the IT lab, for example, and told me to be grateful for the attention. That silenced her, and she told me to go back to my room and I’d hear from her later. The guy was promptly suspended for three weeks, and got a black mark on his record. The worst, and most disgusting part of it was that several girls in the school then proceeded to treat me as a pariah because I had complained. His sister was particularly awful, repeating the line that I should have been grateful for the attention, and “what did I think I was doing messing up his chances of getting into a good university”. In the end I had to sit her down and explain to her just how serious his behaviour had been, and that the only alternative to letting the school handle it was to go to the police, ending with a criminal record for this guy, and his being on the sexual offender’s register for life. I had witnesses to many of the assaults, and told her to go and verify the incidents, if she didn’t believe me. I hope this guy learnt his lesson and, 15 years later, treats women with respect and is grateful that I only complained to the school, and not to the police. "

As I’m in my twenties and trying to establish myself in a new job and career, I felt so humiliated, as though I had no right to be there. Although I was surprised that I was mistaken for a teenager (particularly while dressed in office wear!), I would be even more surprised if any of the young men at work ever hear themselves described as ‘someone’s teenage son’.

"I went out for dinner with new colleagues last week, 7 men and one woman. One of the men repeatedly asked the woman to have a threesome with him and his girlfriend, to take her top off, or to let him go home with her.

"Hi, I’m a Telecom Engineer, I’m Italian and I’m 30th years old. During the university period I was good at studying and I worked hardly to reach good results. But when I took high marks for exams, most of my friends laughed, and told me that it was just because of my good-looking. No credit for the effort then, just for my boobs and my smile. Well, I finished university and I had a lot of job interviews. During these interviews the HRs asked my not many about my technical and scientific knowledge. Instead, they asked if I wanted to have a family, what if I had to choose between job and family, and even if I was engaged, if I lived together with my boyfriend, how long and if it was something serious. Sounds terrible, right? I started working for a big telecom company as engineer. I worked a lot using the phone to talk with colleagues. Nobody took me seriously and every time I answered the phone I had to explain that I was the network engineer and not the secretary. It was often impossible to explain this concept to the technicians who spoke with me: sometimes I had to give up and call some male colleague. When they finally understood that I was actually the engineer, then they began to insult me. At best, instead of insulting me, they invited me for a date. Good. Once a colleague told me these exact words: you want to be a “2.0 female”, but your place is just behind the stove, changing diapers, and that’s just the way it is. You cannot change the reality. Ok, I cannot change the reality, but anyway I changed job. Now, the situation is pretty good, but I’m still the only girl in my office and I have no family. After years, when I go to job meetings, when I meet my colleagues even from other countries, we are always very few girls. Very few. What if I really cannot change the reality? What if it’s true? "
"I had been working there for 1 year. That man, Georges, was only part-time at the office…around 60 years old. I did not know him very well, but some of my female co-workers had already talked about him staring at their breasts and that sort of things. One day, I was at the photocopier, in the hall, and he got behind me. I noticed him, but made no case. Strangely, I knew something was going to happen and I was wondering what. First thing I knew, he was slapping my bum (gently) with a rolled up sheet of paper, saying “Good morning!”. I turned around, my face burning with anger and said loud enough for everybody in the hall to hear: “Not too self-conscious, this morning, Mr. Georges, are you?” He muttered something and kept his head down. No one around looked like they were aware of what had happened. Everything carried on as usual. But I was proud of myself and made sure to tell my story to each of my co-workers who had a similar experience with that man. I no longer work there. Hope Georges reviewed his old-fashioned way to consider and treat women. But what’s important is the strength I gained. "
"After multiple comments from a colleague about my ‘arse’ when I bend over in the shop to put stock away I finally brought it up with my manager and a couple of other members of staff. ‘Oh, but that’s just Matt, you get used to it’ was the response I got from each of them. Why should I have to get used to that kind of thing? "

"I applied for an administration position a few years back. I had put 80 wpm on my resume despite typing closer to 100 wpm. The female interviewer looked at my resume, then with a condescending tone, said “80 words per minute, hey? That’s pretty fast for a man.” insinuating that I was lying on my resume (technically I was, as I was actually faster than I claimed). I grew up playing online games before VOIP was even a thing and communicating quickly in team games was an absolute must. I used MSN Messenger to communicate with friends all throughout my highschool years. As such I developed a fast typing speed. I’m afraid to put my true typing speed on my resume when applying for jobs in female dominated fields in case employers think I’m lying and just throw my resume in the bin. "
"I work in a fast food restaurant. There are two men I work with who constantly torment the girls there every shift. I only work part time with college and my last two shifts I have been experiencing this. One of the men has now been promoted to team leader so he keeps bossing me around “joking” getting all the other lads to laugh. He keeps saying things like “If there’s anything wrong with your workspace, you have to kiss/ride me” and saying “After this, you’re coming back to my house” and even two of them would stand there casually talking about their graphic sex lives, or how “sexy” I am while I’m right there. One of the lads told me that I must’ve loved all the attention he was giving me. But I don’t love it at all. I don’t know why I just can’t do my job without being ridiculed by my co-workers and sexualized in everything I do. Why can’t women in the workplace just be seen as people in the workplace? It’s hard to say anything or even act annoyed because in our culture today it is so normalized and just written off as “taking the p*ss”. "
"Being told to ‘smile’ as I’m walking to the kitchen or toilet, or just sitting doing my work, whenever my male colleague thinks I should be smiling. I note that no one, ever, tells a man to ‘smile!’ on command. Why the expectation that I should be ‘smiling!’ as I go about my day in the office, when I’m not interacting with anyone? And why is it ok to say that to women? Now I make it a point to say ‘smile!’ to this man when I see him. He does not appreciate it. "

The MD was there and laughed at me and told me to calm down it’s just a joke. Still hitting my bum. Also found out he’s married, tried to have an ‘affair’ with a woman who was just friendly to him and is also married and 10 years younger but somehow he gets away with it because of the culture of the workplace.

"I went to a creative meeting and it was mainly all male designers, they looked up and down collectively as I walked in. A male designer when he found out I was also a designer instantly wanted to see my work asking quite aggressively. When I showed him my website he said websites are old hat, i’m not your mother you don’t have to verify yourself to me. Without prompt or any reaction from me he said : “you should be confident in your work, no ones going to do it for you, be stronger’ Then he proceeded to touch my hand which was uncomfortable and his fellow male colleagues were laughing. Not one of them was treated in this way, pretty reminiscent in all publishing, art world and graphic design enviroments! "
"I was at dinner with friends and one girl came straight from her internship to the restaurant. Over drinks she mentioned that there weren’t many good looking guys in the office, actually it was mostly younger women and that women held most of the top spots in the company. I said something about girl power and she laughed and said something about the guys not really minding. I said I thought that it was great that the men didn’t feel emasculated by strong women, to which she replied, no i think it’s because they enjoy the pool of attractive girls to look at and that I sounded like a “right feminist”. I said well yes of course I am, what’s wrong with that, and she said she wasn’t one and that it wasn’t very attractive to men when women are overtly feminist. Also that it’s fine that I am one, but she doesn’t like it when feminists “push their agenda”. As if equality is somehow a nefarious agenda. Honestly, what fresh hell is this? She’ll go along with feminism when it’s under a spice girls slogan, but not when gender equality is actually referred to. Another girl in this group also said she doesn’t understand why people protest anything, that it’s pointless and women don’t really have anything to complain about nowadays when I mentioned I was thinking about going to a march that was set up to bring attention a speight of rapes and sexual assaults in my area. This first girl also constantly pushes nights out on the group that boys she’s talking to are going to be at, and on more than one occasion has then cancelled on us after we’ve agreed because she’s got a tinder date instead. I have no issue at all with her seeing multiple boys and enjoying dating, but it’s getting very hard to mask my irritation whenever she makes her life completely revolve around these boys, especially when she does so in a way that prioritises them over her friends.

"In my lunch room at a major university, the conversation turned to politics. There were repeated references to “balls” and “pricks” (the size there of) and a lot of laughter, banter, and ridicule. As a thinking woman, I was appalled by the position my male colleagues were put in while occupying the same space. I feel we need to support all forms of casual sexism and ridicule. Normalizing being as bad as the worst examples of misogynistic behaviour is not a good or useful response. We all deserve compassion and not to be victimized on the basis of the lowest exemplars of our genders. I felt ashamed. If my male colleagues had done the same, they would have been reported and sacked. "

As if a girl couldn’t possibly want to work with computers. I’m working towards a degree in computer science… "
"I was talking to friends discussing careers, parents and growing up. Midway through this conversation I realized that all through my childhood I had been told by my parents, mainly my Father, that to get anywhere and to succeed in life that I would have to work twice as hard if not more to get to the same place as male colleagues. These comments that before had flown under my radar as â€œlife adviceâ€?, are now becoming apparent as something a little more damaging especially combined with the programming found in the rest of the media and society. Looking at it now objectively, I realized that he was trying to prepare me for the hard work it would take for me to push myself into a male dominated career path, something that I had shown great interest in from an early age. He strongly thought that hard work was the be all and end all, and disparaged women that â€œused their looksâ€? to advance. And so, I knew from a reasonably young age that I would never be pretty or sexy enough for that even if it was â€˜acceptableâ€™; that I didnâ€™t have family contacts or money, so your work ethic and quality had to speak for you. This resulted in excuses for a wage gap, unending long hours, being saddled with an unequal work load, putting a hold on plans and making personal and social sacrifices that male peers don’t. being unwilling to take time off because your boss can guilt you easily into not taking it, because you know it will be counted on your pay review and used as an excuse and explanation about why you canâ€™t match the â€˜boysâ€™. Constantly fearing and worrying about your image, the conversations that stop the moment you walk into a room, the subtle and not so subtle teasing and remarks about your body, clothing, appearance. The boys will be boys attitude and the excuses and acceptance of the culture. If you wear makeup, if you donâ€™t. if you wear an outfit more than once in a week, even though that person has worn the same suit all week just with different ties. If your dressing like a â€˜girlâ€™ or â€˜trying to fit in with the guysâ€™. God forbid you wear heels, opens a whole new can of worms. Knowing that you must work your way up in experience but the person next to you has been there for less time and is totally incompetent and has already been promoted. Having to constantly play an incredibly convoluted social game that male peers bypass with â€˜locker room talkâ€™ and a couple of beers for the male boss. Worrying about being too bossy, not assertive enough, being told that women are just not really suited to a leadership role. And even then at the end of writing this feeling like I have to apologise for pointing it all out and voicing my frustrations, and guilt, like itâ€™s all my fault and that I shouldnâ€™t be making a fuss and that it not ‘significant’ enough to warrant sharing.

"I was 17 and had worked at the same place for three years. It was a part time job next to high school but since I had worked there for so long I’d learned quite a bit. It was a jewlers shop and we’d also fix watches. One day a man walked in and asked me: “Your boss. Is he in?” I replied that she wasn’t in but I could help him or leave a message for her. Then he said: “Who is that guy who works here?”. I answered that the guy who works here is called Paul. He looked at me and said: “Okay, do you know when he’ll be here?”. I didn’t know and asked him if there was anything I could help him with. “Oh I just need a new batteri for my watch”. I told him that I could do that and leaned over the counter to take his watch when he snapped his hand away. “I prefer someone more experienced”. I told him that Paul was in fact my age and had only been in the job for two months whilst I had been working there for three years. He scowled and asked if the jewlers a few blocks away was open, he needed a new battery as soon as possible. I told him it was open, but I knew it wasn’t. I was just so mad. After half an hour he came back with his head lowered a bit. “Uhm, can you change the battery for me?” I looked up at him and asked “I don’t know. Can I?”. Sorry for any English mistakes. It’s not my first language. I’m from Norway: one of the countries that is ranked as most equal in the world. I know this seems like a small thing, but simmilar stuff happens all the time. I’ve even been told by teachers to tone it down a bit in class because I was making the boys feel inadequate. I’m an angry feminist because I have the right to be angry; both on behalf of myself and on behalf of others. "
"We’re 3 girls working with 2 men, the toilet is outside down a narrow paved path, every time one of us goes to the toilet, George one of the men goes to, he stands in the narrow path and makes us push past him, no matter which way we walk, front, side, backwards, he pushes his crutch and erect penis on us. He thinks it’s funny, there is also a narrow hallway in the workplace and George stands there to pushing his crutch against us when we walk by, he laughs, sometime we even laugh. But it isn’t funny!

"I worked for a small home building company back in the â€˜90â€™s. My boss (who was the father of 6) allowed me to bring my infant daughter to work with me so that I could care for her myself and still do my office work. An investment advisor friend of his came by the office while the baby was napping. My boss was on the phone so I chatted with our guest while he waited. The whole time we were talking his eyes kept wandering to my breasts, crotch, and occasionally my face. It was gross, but not my first experience with this type of man. Finally boss-man got off the phone and his ogling guest joined him in his office. The baby woke up later on and I was breast-feeding her at my desk. Our guest walked back through on his way out. We spoke for a few of minutes before he took his leave. During this second conversation, ogle-man was capable of maintaining full eye contact for the entire time. I still wonder about this abrupt difference of behavior all these years later. I guess having an actively nursing child is a sort of porn kryptonite? "
"I am going through the process of buying a house with my boyfriend. We are not married, so we do not have the same surname. We would be categorised as people co-purchasing a house. The background is that it was my registered account with the housing association that brought the notification email, indicating that the development was available for viewings. When we saw the house and decided that we wanted to go for it, it was me that submitted the expression of interest form. When things got rolling, the instruction to the solicitor came from me. It was also me who firstly and directly contacted the financial assessors and sent through all of our documentation for them to review. Now, that is not to say that my lovely boyfriend hasn’t more than done his fair share. We have sat together evening after evening filling out forms and then calling people. I have always been applicant one, with him as my co-applicant. This is how we have filled out every form and the way we have approached it form the start. And yet… everything, but EVERYTHING we get sent back to us switches my boyfriend to applicant one and me to appliant two. The first form we got back was from the housing association. I immediately rasied it with them saying that the details of the form were incorrect, as I was applicant one, whereas they had switched me to applicant two. I was told that it ‘wasn’t relevant’. Our housing association contact is also a woman. My boyfriend also sent a reply email asking for the names to be switched back to me as applicant one, as this is how we have filled out every other form. They changed nothing. The next thing was a letter sent to us by the solicitor. When it came through, same thing, my name came after Mr’s. I sent an email to the solicitor right away, asking that my name be the first addresse on all correspondence, as I am applicant one. The reply was that ‘the system’ automatically puts my boyfriend’s name first and that there was nothing that she (that’s right, another woman supporting sexism) could do about it. Too right ‘the system’ puts the man’s name first. Well, I am furious. The housing association and the solicitor’s practice will hear all about their system’s archaic shortcomings once we are safely in our new house and the whole process is over. Just a reminder to everyone about the context of this, not only is it the year 2017, it was International women’s Day yesterday. How sad… "
"My ex-boss, a man of 31, noticed a few greys in my hair and demanded to know when I was going to dye them. A third of his own hair is silver, but of course when women gets greys, dying them is priority #1, amirite? Instead of pointing this out to him and risking his wrath professionally (he is a VERY petty boy) I instead mentioned how I wanted to try Henna in my hair as it’s all natural. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said something to the effect of “Women will believe anything you tell them! Hair dye isn’t natural!”. Anyone who knows what henna is will know that he is the one who is, in fact, the idiot because it’s a dye that’s 100% natural. "
"Last Friday i was in Vienna with a friend of mine and we were just having a walk and at the moment there are a lot of asyls from afganistan and so on which are also in linz where i am from, and im used to it to get some comments about my appearance and my look. But it’s not about them now. So we were walking and there was a policeman and he was really goodlooking, a very pretty man, i said to my friend “look at hin he’s so pretty” he didn’t hear this he was too far aways . I wore black leather trousers. im 17 and he was about 35 & he was a damn policeman, so we passed by him when he said ” Sexy trousers” i said what ? he smiled with a dirty face and said again ” you’re wearing hot trousers” I was confused and frightened because on the same day i got botheres a few times more by asyls.. and instead of taking care to make me feel safe or not that low there is this policeman flirting with me.

"I work in a bar in Toronto, Canada and my boss has sexually harassed me on multiple occasions. He has grabbed my ass, said inappropriate things to me of a sexual nature and just yesterday, when I thought he had stopped (a friend who also worked there made a comment about his inappropriate treatment of me), he pantomimed spanking my bottom in front of several customers. When I reacted in a surprised, upset way, he passed it off as me being “oversensitive” about my body being touched. No boss, its called workplace sexual harassment. "
"I was followed, when walking to work at 10:30AM, for approximately 10 minutes, by a man shouting that he “was going to eat my sweet c**t”. I passed a busy bus stop and a tram stop filled with people with him shouting all the while. Looking around all I got was turned faces or smirks. Finally, fearing he was going to follow me all the way to my workplace (where I generally work alone) I told him to “f*****g leave me alone”. He replied, with a smile, “Next time I see you alone I’m going to rip you apart”. On telling people, the majority responded with : you shouldn’t have antagonised him. I was left feeling helpless twice over. "
"A mild annoyance, but something that troubles me nonetheless as it’s happened more than once: When my boss brings a male customer into the back office to consult on a project, and the customer says to him, “Oh you’re outnumbered now mate!” – referring to the fact that me and my recently-hired co-worker are both young women. These customers are usually lovely blokes and great to work with otherwise, but this drives me crazy – we’re not silly/crazy/ball-busting wenches who will gang up on our poor boss. In 2014, educated young women are not something unusual to find in a skilled workplace and our presence should not elicit surprise like this. The fact that we’re both women is completely inconsequential and shouldn’t be getting a reaction at all, even if it’s a good humoured one. We have our jobs because we were the best and most qualified people available (in a trade that is by no means dominated by men anyway). Our boss doesn’t feel threatened by us or superior to us. It’s a great place to work in that sense, and comments like these only remind me that other women aren’t so lucky – and what ridiculousness that we should feel “lucky” that we’re treated like just another employee when surely that should be the default. And then there are the blokes who make jokes/comments alluding to sex, or implying that us arguing with the boss over something somehow makes us like his wives, or other such nonsense. How do they not see how creepy and uncomfortable that is? "
"I am a professional conference interpreter, worked for various conferences including the UN, IAEA, and ILO. Once a well-known German automotive company hired me for their high-end lux car launch event. Throughout the entire week, I was addressed as “Missy”, “Ms. Interpreter”, or worse, “A-chan” (“chan”: Japanese word for “little miss”). The only time I was called by my name was then they wanted to introduce me to one of their client who “personally liked me”, and asked me to “sit next him and pour beer to his glass”. I downed my pint and walked away. "
"I was running an office for the VC of a well known and prestigious London university and was also the VC’s PA. I’d been doing it for 2 years with a team of 3. A new VC was being inducted when I was told without consultation or any notice that I would be redeployed or made redundant. No explanation why, nothing. There had been no performance issues nor were any subsequently raised. The person who replaced me had no experience of line management, or of managing a team or an office, or as a PA, or of the administrative demands of a busy office at high level. Furthermore they would not be expected to do any PA work. They could write policies however, something I could have done but was never asked to and which could have been dealt with as a developmental training matter. The person who replaced me was a man and to add insult to injury they were put on a starting salary two bands higher than mine. I asked again a year later why I was thrown out of my job and was told that I didn’t like the incoming VC anyway! I successfully fought to keep a job with my employer. I fought successfully again to be placed on a higher salary band with my male peers. And guess what… I write policies in my current role! Oh and the man who replaced that man was promoted up another two salary bands with no change of job description. "
"After a year of promising to promote me and insisting that I deserved the promotion and would receive it during my next “official” review (which was then delayed and rescheduled three times over the course of 10 months), I addressed my frustration with my boss very directly. She snapped at me for my “demanding” attitude, which she deemed “inappropriate” and “ungrateful” and reminded me that “there are hundreds of girls graduating every day with liberal arts degrees lining up around the block for your job. You will never have an opportunity to negotiate your salary. Keep your head down and be grateful.” I then overheard her discussing my situation with another of the senior employees. My boss was annoyed by my doggedness in persistently asking her to deliver on her promises, and blamed “the Lean In effect” to which our coworker replied: “tell that little twerp there are more important things happening right now than her silly promotion.” "
"I was at a job interview in which several of us sat and waited outside the room and went in one at a time. No-one said anything but it was quite easy to hear what was being said, you could hear the other applicants being interviewed, and it became clear that the interviewers were asking the same questions to everyone. Obviously this gave a big advantage to people going in last. Anyway, a male applicant went in before me and I heard him say that he’d stayed at home to look after the children why his wife had gone to work. I listened in intently at this point because I had been out of the workplace for a long time too for the same reason. The interviewers, one female and one male, starting asking him why he “let his wife support him” and “didn’t he contribute financially” and they summed the situation up by saying “so you’ve been living off your wife for the past x number of years.” I knew that it was going to be an issue that I had been off the job market for a while but I didn’t think the interviewers would be so hostile and basically accuse me of sponging off my partner. Anyway, my turn came and they got to the questions about my recent work history and I explained that I’d stayed at home to look after the children. They asked me about how I supported myself during this time and I said my partner had gone out to work. to my complete surprise they just smiled and one of the interviewers even said that looking after children was a job in itself. At the time I was relieved but later it really niggled at me because it showed that there is still such a strong belief in “woman’s work”. "
Having to explain to someone why commenting on women’s looks approvingly isn’t okay in the workplace and then *of course* it is claimed that I “just don’t have a sense of humour” and I am the one in the wrong.

"I could not possibly narrow it down to one time or one place, sexism and sexual harassment are things I’ve experienced since I was a little girl learning about what “girls are good for”. I remember hearing from the men and sometimes women around me from a very young age that girls were not as smart or as strong as boys, girls were supposed to grow up, get married and have babies. That was my reality. I was molested by neighborhood boys when I was very young, raped by guy I didn’t know at a party at 13, survived an attempted rape at 15 and raped again by a boyfriend in high school, and when I threatened to leave him he hung the threat of suicide over my head knowing I had lost other friends and family to suicide, I felt trapped. I was sexually assaulted and humiliated at my high school prom and tossed around like a rag doll, guys were always trying to get me drunk and I couldn’t count how many times I have been told to drink up when I knew I was already far past my limit, I got tired of hearing about my”hourglass figure”, boys didn’t hear me, they saw me. I had my ass grabbed by my ex-father-in law, he laughed it off like it was no big deal. I drank one night with my husband and his army buddy, I woke up and my (ex)husband wasn’t there, but his friend was and he had my shirt almost completely unbuttoned and he kept trying to tell me he wanted to help me get my pajamas on and put me in bed. I was once literally cornered (while at work) and touched by a married man when I was 5 months pregnant, he kept telling me I was beautiful pregnant, and lifted my shirt and started rubbing my belly, his energy was intense and intimidating, I had to push him away, scared the crap out of me! He kept insisting on giving me money for baby things and kept coming in when it was my shift and he knew I was alone, I had to report it. Same job, a co-worker who was also married approached me and out of no where asked if I liked giving head and if he was the kind of guy I would date, etc. I had to switch shifts to get away from him. On top of sexual harassment I am tired of feeling like I should have to be a certain way, look a certain way, act a certain way, I have lived my whole life with depression and off and on suicidal tendencies, eating disorders and drug abuse (in high school) because I had, and still in some ways have, a warped sense of self. It’s something I have been working on for so long to come to grips with, dealing with trying to feel “normal” after everything that has happened in my life. "

When my boss told me he wanted to take me to the lapdancing club that was considered a good spot for ‘teambuilding’ nights out. Some female coworkers had pointed out that it was a teeny bit pointless to arrange a team night out and only invite the men. His solution was not to change the venue but to ask if he could watch while I had a lapdance. 
"My mother, who I love dearly, thinks that women who have children and work are selfish. ‘Why did they bother having children if they never see them?’ This is not something that people usually ask of men with children. I have a child. I work, because I need the money (not that my reasons should matter). But still she makes these comments. I see examples of women – but not men – being expected to put family first, everywhere in society. I live in the UK, and although we have maternity leave, return to work at the same level is made difficult, if not impossible, while also maintaining a healthy, stable environment for the children. This is utterly short-sighted! Leaving early for the school run, flexible working hours and sabbaticals are seen as some kind of treat, rather than something that not only enhances the family unit but also society. Well-attached, confident children make effective contributors to society, both now and as adults. Recent changes to maternity law have allowed both parents to shared the leave, which is a step in the right direction. But if companies genuinely want to retain the smart, talented individuals who they lose to motherhood, then they (and governemt) have to make it easier for us to stay. Sexism won’t just go away; I see it like a horrible disease in society that will slowly be eradicated, generation by generation. "

"A male Archaeologist in a supervisory role with a new wife and baby working in an all male team (bar me, female) boasted of how he’d love to get some ‘ripe 15year olds’ volunteering on the site. I don’t think he meant boys…. A male Archaeologist colleague working in an all male team (bar me, female) on hearing the news that a female supervisor would be joining us for a while, spitted out venomously how he wasn’t going to be ‘told what to do by some fucking WOMAN!’ A male colleague, on hearing that cake is being offered in the team, makes the by now well worn (out) comment; ‘Great, I love a good tart’. A male former manager, on welcoming me into the team with my CV in front of him, looked down at it and sneered, ‘So, you’ve got a First’, and proceeded for the next year to prove through bullying and belittling behaviour, how stupid I really was. He was demoted some years later for abusing workplace rules, including bullying another female member of the team. A male cab driver who regularly drives lone female colleagues around has in his cab, a pair of pink rubbery boobs with the words, ‘I Love Tits’ underneath, stuck to the passenger side)dashboard. On leaving a hospital visit to a male friend on an all male ward recently, my friend asked me to adjust his pillows. When another male patient asked with a knowing wink if I could do his too, my usually rational, intelligent and sensitive friend shouted over, ‘She will. She’s not cheap but she might even do you a few ‘extra’s’ to laughs around the ward, before I even had chance to answer. When I berated him for it a few days later he brushed it off with ‘Oh, it was just lads having a bit of fun’. A married male former manager on coming over to my desk to apologise for over-reacting to an oversight on my part, leaned into my ear to tell me in hushed tones that I could ‘slap his wrists for him’ as a punishment for his behaviour. An ex-boyfriend got in touch some 17years after we split up as young 20-somethings. On taking off my coat, revealing all of my size 12-14 frame, my ex said, ‘Don’t you go to a gym then?’ (He didn’t try to keep in touch afterwards). Similarly, a male colleague some years ago said I was pretty but ‘Could improve myself a lot if I just went to the gym a few times a week’. These are just some of the immediate examples that spring to mind. I’d find many more if I dug deeper. On balance, I have met and still know, many wonderful men who don’t judge women by their looks or perceived sexual availability, who are not threatened by their qualifications and intelligence and who are respectful, witty and fun to be with or just unoffensive and therefore more approachable. Long may they live and BREED!!!! "

Can you move these boxes for us?.” Big smiles on and very polite, when I politely declined they both looked incredibly shocked and put out. I tried to point out that yes I am a man however there is a PE teacher who is at their physical best just a meter away and they are physically fitter and more capable for the task of deadlifting and moving a heavy object than I am. The PE teacher was female, unfortunately the two office staff looked at me, then to the PE teacher, then each other and back to me and with a confused look said “but your a man?”. "

This has been disturbing me a lot and every time I get superangry again, but my male collegues or male friends always respond that I’m overreacting and that it’s not a that big deal, while literally every single female I talk to about this seem to understand my frustration and furthermore relate to it…. I have discovered that I truly am the stereotype angry feminist; not because I hate men but because the rape culture constantly justifies and normalizes what happens to me.

"I moved overseas to work for an aid organisation and became one of the targets of severe bullying. Being a young woman from a minority background and brought into a role of seniority that was somehow deemed undeserved, in retrospect I was an obvious choice. A fellow young female recruit was treated so badly with daily verbal abuse and taunting she moved teams in a matter of months. When she left I bore the brunt of the abuse. I took my problems to management, HR and finally the ombudsman and nothing was done, the direct accusations of ‘incompetency’ ‘letting people down’ ‘destroying months of people’s work’ and so forth then turned into indirect rumour spreading that became so pervasive it spread outside the organisation. I was humiliated in front of people that I hadn’t even met. People I considered friends distanced themselves from me. I was alone, unsupported and continued in this way for a number of months, to the point where I found myself speaking to at least 3 therapists, workplace mediators, and even lawyers. At one stage someone even considered me a suicide risk. Needless to say, I got out as soon as I could, though not before they had begun to label me the ‘heavily medicated woman” despite me never having taken any antidepressants at all. When I first complained, it was my word against theirs, then when I collected evidence of the bullying they threatened that they could prove I somehow illegally obtained the proof. I have completely lost confidence professionally and personally, I still cry whenever I think about it. Not a good place to be considering in my previous job there had been an incident where at a work function two older men (one married) decided they wanted to grope and kiss me after they had too much to drink. Not reporting that incident is still a regret of mine although I had no doubt at the time that it would have resulted in my termination, just as another girl who complained about sexual harassment ended up taking a long ‘stress leave’ and eventually left the country. I wish I had a good story to tell, maybe one day things will improve for us women. I hope to see this in my lifetime! "
"“Do you have any idea how many people check you out?” A client said this to me one day while walking down the street in Toronto, ON. The same client who wanted to have an affair with me while he was still married. In my 20’s I was sexually harassed in every single workplace. Not to mention molested by a family doctor. I was asked for direcions once went to the car leary…(thankyou mom) and they guy had no pants on. ewwww I was 12. In my 40’s working in the construction industry, you aren’t taken seriously unless your behind a desk shuffling paperwork. I would take a female boss any day of the week. All of this has made me a stronger woman although I feel sad for my girls who are 13 and 14. I’m thankful my husband is respectful of me. This will definately help them to see their worth and accept the love they know they deserve. "
"A few years ago, my boss who was only a few years older than me harassed me for six months. He conducted my interview for the job and at that time I found him to be very shy and quiet. First he tried to make friends with all the staff, inviting them over to his house for parties because he’d just moved there and wanted friends. He felt lonely, he said. He finally started to invite just me and one other friend who worked there over to his house. He started texting me a lot, rostering us on together, asking if I wanted to hang out outside of work. I did, thinking that he was just trying to be my friend. Then the comments crept in – I was beautiful, amazing, every good thing under the sun. He would text me good morning, using pet names. I told him he was my boss and that he couldn’t act like he was my boyfriend and that I wasn’t attracted to him, so he had to stop. He got upset and tried to make me feel guilty for rejecting him. I had to reject him another five times, in the workplace. He said he’d hired me because he had fallen in love with me the first time he saw me. He said he would quit his job – which was well-paid with good benefits – in order to be with me. I told him repeatedly I wasn’t interested, and that he was just my friend. He persisted for six months. He kissed me, which I wasn’t receptive to, and then said I couldn’t tell anyone because he’d lose his job. I switched departments after a while because it was affecting my personal life and my mental health. A lot later I realised what he had done was wrong – so I reported him for sexual harassment. I told my new boss that he had harassed me and she tried to get me fired for gossip in the workplace. I hung on by a thread after that, eventually being hospitalised. To my knowledge, my boss whom I reported for harassment hasn’t been able to find employment since. That was two years ago. "

"i have four boys and i was a single mother since my oldest two (twins) were 8 – they are now 26. I am an individualist and my sons are big on respect for women but they do fall down. I have listened to my kids and how they make their way in their world without a male role model (their father was and is abusive towards them, as well as me in the past). It is scary and when i look back – there are things i wish i had done differently but there are things i just wouldn’t change. One thing i could never work out was how a mother with my thoughts and behaviour had brought up four male chauvanists. One thing i got used to hearing was “you are not a boy or a man”, so how would you know? To them, there is woman’s work and there is man’s work! Simple. My youngest is a brilliant listener and communicator and i have encouraged him to do a basic counselling course but his reply was “men don’t counsel, it isn’t men’s work!” I am trained to level 3 in counselling and i can honestly say that i have always been confused by people throughout virtually my whole life and i am 48. Counselling has made a world of difference to my understanding of the world and human behaviour and i wish i had done it earlier, it might have helped with some pretty difficult situations. At 22, i discovered that life was lie! My husband had delivered his first slap which blacked my eye and told me not to bother telling anyone because no-one would believe me. He went to work and i called my mother and told her i was coming home because my husband had just hit me and she told me that ” life isn’t a bed of roses, the grass isn’t greener and maybe i need to be controlled!” My two twins were screaming for food and i was sat in total despair on the bottom of the stairs. It was January 1988 and we were to take my newborn twin sons to liverpool to visit his parents. To do this we needed to hire a car and for this he needed his passport which he couldn’t find. i told him where it was but he still couldn’t see it and when i went to the cupboard and passed it over my shoulder i was accused of poking him with it and he lashed out. End of the beginning! My life plan (happily ever after) had just taken a new course. Over the next eight years, it got worse, i was locked in the house without phone or keys to get out, i was locked in the garage for short periods, cold, in the dark. i went without the meals i had cooked. i took punches and was thrown across the room. My goal posts changed and instead of seeing these punches as wrong and painful, my goal was to stay on my feet – it was never achieved! Finally he lost his cheque guarantee card one night in October 1994. Again i told him where it was and he couldn’t find it, so i went to the wardrobe which was ceiling height almost. he was 6’3? and i am 5’2?. so i stood on the bed and then on the bedside cabinet and i found it. i handed it to him and jumped down whereupon he lashed out! i no longer felt it. i didn’t believe him when he told me my blood was on the wall. i just wanted to get away but he took hold of me and made me see the arch of blood where he had caught my nose. It was now my job to clean up the mess i had made and told him to do one. i carried on trying to get away whereupon he threw me on the bed and sat astride me and put his hands around my neck. It sounds crazy when i say it felt nice as i passed out – a bit like that floaty feeling we get sometimes get before we fall asleep, relaxed with not a care in the world – a far cry from minutes earlier when i was trying to remove his hands and shrug him off my body in my terror. When i came round my five year old was standing in the doorway in his pyjamas threatening to kill his father if he didn’t get off me and then he legged it when my husband moved to chase him so i jumped up and onto his back and was thrown across the room landing on the bed winded at least twice. It was some years before i realized that my five year old had witnessed most of it and in some ways more than i had – his father must have panicked and sat there hitting me to bring me back round – this memory came out when i had to spend most of 2000-2001 in hospital because my youngest had cancer. This left my third child, my witness, feeling abandonned which he voiced and he asked how i always abandonned them when things were difficult. I wasn’t there when i divorced because i was being threatened with death and had to leave and i wasn’t there when my son had cancer because i was at the hospital with my youngest child for three weeks of every month for virtually the whole year. i lied when he asked why his father was hitting me (which also came out) “i told him his father was trying to help me”. ok it was a half lie – my husband was trying to help – but himself – after he had lost it and done something unintelligible which he obviously realized was wrong or perhaps he was scared. But what affect has that lie had? i asked a counsellor years ago if i should go back and correct that because i have always felt guilty about not telling him the truth but always with an awareness that he should make his own mind up about his father and we are spoonfed ideas about love and respect for parents when we are kids – why should mine be any different and why should i have been different? I hadn’t done any counselling training then but since that time the same child has been threatened by his father more than once, he has asked me if his father put me off men and was gutted when i told him about past relationships which had been kept hidden to protect them. Our children are good judges of relationships and i shouldn’t have hidden them, my kids could have guided me into steady relationships instead of ones which ended when the men involved needed commitment and i was too scared to give it. Apparently, my son had assessed the men concerned and had thought he could have made a dad of two of them in particular even though this conversation took place when he was 18/19 whereas the relationships had occurred ten years previous. he voiced his outright disappointment at his father, the let down of a bad role model, the lack of a drinking partner and someone to talk to about the boy to man stuff which i couldn’t advise on. Shaving isn’t as straight forward as we women might think apparently. Except when i first divorced, my mother told me in no uncertain terms that i should not have another relationship because step fathers are the worst for abusing kids. Even at 30 years old, my mother had the moral authority and wisdom to advise me with crap and heresay. I had started divorce proceedings in August 1995 finally and in those eight years i saw my witness thrashed, while dangling in the air, until he was red from his ankle to back. i was scared he would bruise. i went after him when my husband dropped him and it was over but was told to sit back down or i would get the same. i sat back down. i was given leave to get the child a while later. i was amazed at what happened. I went to my child who pushed me away and just looked at me, no tears, no words just a silence across which we both communicated something. He didn’t want the contact, he needed to stay away, he needed to stay intact. i talked to him from the other end of the bed on which he was lying across, respecting his needs. I told him that he had to come downstairs and he did. My husband took him on his knee and apologized and kissed him (my kids were not allowed to kiss me because kissing was always for puffs) and then he told him that that was Daddy’s job, what daddy had to do to teach him right from wrong and that if he didn’t do wrong, daddy would not need to do that. My two year old – my witness – had already learned to man up (as my kids put it). That is scary!It was only then that the child cried. My oldest was five when we were walking to school one day – he had worked out his father’s shifts and said “dad will be home tonight, won’t he?” and i said “yes”. He shot back, “I hate it when dad’s there”. i didn’t say anything, i couldn’t say anything. my child felt exactly the same way i did. He didn’t like being forced to watch “Toy factory” – just the gorey bits – and all the other videos which i was shocked to learn that were all the same as the Jamie Bulger killers had watched! I had to do the same. Me and three sons, lined up on the settee under threat of his temper. The youngest was had cried over ET so he got cut a bit of slack. I could go on forever! The point is what went wrong? Why did i stay for so long? What changed? First off, we have matters of respect for kids! As a kid, i saw my mother fear my father. I wasn’t scared of him, i was scared of her and her temper after she used a stick on my four year old sister for repeating some swear words she had heard in a supermarket. i was dumbfounded that day and never really got over it, i guess. It was my mother who did the shouting, screaming and hitting in our house because she was trying too hard to bring up the perfect kids. I learned i didn’t want to be like that though and when on a school cruise in Italy, i threw my lire into the wishing fountain in Rome, my wish was to have six children and to listen to them – i was 11 3/4 at the time. i have done just that. But i had internalized something and it is something about public perceptions and expectations about relationships and displaying the happy ever after. it is also about putting others first. I stayed for the kids. i stayed because i wasn’t believed because i was a weak irrational female. I kept quiet after my first complaint and thought my mother was taking the mickey when she asked me one day why i had a black eye. i cannot remember the incident but i remember telling her one of the kids had thrown a toy car and it had hit me. i was confused by her question given that i had complained a couple of years before and couldn’t believe she was so thick skinned (she was). You see we just have to move on, get over it and i got good at that. On a daily basis i was a baby, a short, fat, ugly, slut – these were issued from my loving husband. My young witness’ first words to me were “fuck off”. I told him he was wrong to speak to me like that and he shouldn’t say that and he didn’t ever again. He was also male and that is something that has always irked me. I internalized superior male values and it is layered through my family at some level. One of my twins in college did social sciences and learned that women in the workforce had actually meant that his wages weren’t as high as they would have been – we were denting his male ego and it was unacceptable. They have to start giving the rounded version of facts – my son might have understood it differently if the tutor had then pointed out how women were at the mercy of men until they were able to earn their own wages. As a single mother, i didn’t insult my children and i tried everything i could to negate and surround them with nice people. i was always angered by father’s words towards my kids “big girl’s blouse, puff, baby”. Then one day my youngest at nine years was taken hold of by my father for something stupid. My father squeezed his arm rather tightly and lifted him slightly and my youngest said “fuck off” and walked out. After a search of the area, i had to extend my search and i started to drive home ten miles away – i found him three hours after exiting on the dual carriageway a mile from home. he must have run most of it. I dropped him home – he was a good kid – and went back to my parents to collect my other three kids. my parents were disgusted but i stood proud “you were hurting him and you have no right to do that” my mother told me that he should respect my father and adults and i stood there and said when he is respected, yes! The best thing i ever did! My father never touched any of my kids again at least not to chastize them. As they got older one of my kids got into punching fights with him – i could never understand what was so funny about taking it in turns to punch one another’s upper arm but the point was the squirming from it. My son proved that he could take it; he was a man! Name calling, laughing at children, putting them down, calling them stupid, sarcasm – it is inherent in most families at some level and it is easy to talk about them in front of them because they can’t fight back. We follow the patterns of family behaviour. i walked in my mother’s footsteps as a wife but as a parent i did it my way. It is how we treat kids that counts. Let’s follow their example. My kids knew right from wrong from the first and they believed me and themselves. it was the adults in my life that got it wrong. Adults who are the moral majority and authority who are not so moral – when we allow ourselves to be challenged by our children on an equal basis we prove to be pretty useless as a guide and example or at least i did. i can tell you a thing or two about some of my experiences but they did me good. I came home one night late after dinner on a rainy night with a friend. It was one fortyfive am when i arrived home after her husband had told me to stick around because the lanes were lakes and we had nearly got stuck. My 18 year old padded down stairs and demanded where i had been. After quite an interrogation, i pointed out that “i should remind you that i am the adult in this relationship” to which he replied ” oh yes, you’re the adult. The adult who is big on respect, the adult who demands we phone home when we are going to be late”. and then i knew, i closed my eyes and quietly signed as realized – as you do. ” So where is your respect, where was your phone call?” i paid for days! he made sure of that but it did teach about my own double standards! They let me know about my incongruence and hypocracy as i told them to do it one way and then another and then they pulled me up and said you keep changing your mind and we had to agree to let them lead their own lives and i was their support, standing at their shoulder in times of strife but they learned to take more responsibility than i ever knew how to do. My parents were always for responsible for me and then my husband. Women were not capable even in the 1980/90s and we always had to obey didn’t we? And i did! I obeyed my mother and i obeyed my husband because they were superior. I will never forget sitting in a counselling lecture and answering a question. my answer was different to everyone else’s and the tutor asked why i thought that and i replied “because my head is up my own arse”. She just looked at me and said “someone has said that to you – who? I was shocked at the time but it took me all of five minutes to work it out – my parents, although i didn’t admit it at the time. They were my father’s words but my mother always supports him. I have had my head up my own arse since my early days, we are just not allowed to make our own minds up are we? I treated my kids with respect and they respect me. One son stood up against a pimp with a knife to protect a prostitute and when i told him he was stupid or brave, he replied “No, he probably wouldn’t have used the knife (his reasoning was that most people wouldn’t) and if it was me i would want help in that situation” – i felt ashamed. It was my fear for him that lead me to make my statement but it was his sense of right and wrong that made the difference”. It was his twin who lost his job after speaking out about bullying in the workplace. It was my youngest who accompanied a child in school to stop the bullying, who was crying when i came home from work in 2010 because he had read on the internet about a young girl who had died after 70/90 strokes of that cane for being raped, that a woman had been stoned, unearthered, stoned and finally shot for her adultery with her innocent male married accomplice all in the same week that a mother in the uk had taken drugs or alcohol and left her child in front of the fire to die (not intentionally. I sat and talked him through it. I like his response although i stayed standing so that i didn’t make him feel uncomfortable was he was trying to hide his tears – if boys don’t cry how shameful is it for an eighteen year old. I respected my sons and they are chauvanists in their own way, but they have another side because i instilled them with respect by respecting them. That is what we need to change in this society. We need to take lessons from our children and consider our own adult authoritarianism and hypocracy, follow 5 year old standards of behaviour and we can breed out this insulting, offensive behaviour. Children are not born evil, they learn the nastiness whilst presenting niceness to the powers that be in the family, in school. How many parents have screamed at their kids and then opened the front door to present cool, calm and collected nice as pie to the astonishment of their hurt youngster? What is all that about? Do as i say not as i do – do we not expect higher standards of behaviour from our children than we do from adults? Should we not be trying to cool calm and collected with our children. When my second twin was 15 i pulled him up about something he had said. i told him that i felt ashamed of his behaviour even though only us in the family had heard what he had said. He said “you’re angry aren’t you?” and i replied “no, i am absolutely furious” he shot back so why don’t you act it, scream shout or hit me” and i came back with “where does that get us? what do we learn from that” He then told me that ” i should let go” and then he advised me that “being screamed, shouted at or hit is easier to deal with! It is short and over with. This way I have to live with myself!” I couldn’t help but hide my smile. he had just told me how right i was to discuss rather than behave like most authoritarians. He was taking responsibility for his own behaviour because it was under discussion and he had to acknowledge it. All these problems are inherent in our society: authority doesn’t necessarily know better because of the different historical context. And who is the authority anyway? How does authority behave – how many parents and teachers do as was done to them, scream and clip round the ear (or worse) over and done with. i always wondered how come the teachers who demanded the highest standards were the ones who screamed the loudest and the most, and looked like idiots sometimes. They demanded control from us students but where was theirs? When a teacher tried to help me, encourage me, befriend me, not for any horrible means, i believed even that she just wanted the best for me and instead of taking on board her heart felt interest, i was confused by her niceness and had a need to protect myself – from niceness, i ask you! I didn’t feel cared for as a kid and was big listener of Pale Shelter by Tears for Fears on their The Hurting album. I wondered how parents could say they cared when they didn’t listen, they mocked, they hit, they shouted, screamed and they hit, where is the caring in that? As kids do not the majority of us learn that controling behaviour is caring just like i did. We didn’t feel good about ourselves. At 11, i learned about adultery in RE when i met my secondary school friends and we saw one father in the local town with his bit on the side. At 15 one of my school friends father commited suicide and his wife – my friends mother was always so serious which was a dead giveaway about how she felt about life. A boy at 14 insulted me badly one day and then he asked to speak to me – he apologized and told me where the bruises came from – he was protecting his mother from his fathers drunken outnursts. i was the only one that knew in the school. We had always been friends and now we spent hours in the long grass being accused of all sorts but he was really telling me how he felt about life. At 19 he was the one of only two who advised against my relationship with my future husband. he recognized it and said it and i didn’t believe him because he was 19. My mother didn’t like my future husband either and had threatened to cut me off from the will but told me she preferred that he was going to live with me because it put her mind at rest! When my father asked “are you sure about this? as we were about to walk down the aisle. All i could think about was what my mother would say? At 22 i was as scared of her temper as i was through childhood from that day. Fear is doing our society in! We are taught to be frightened, it is transferred through the emotional interaction we have as children. Fear and the resulting fight or flight. If we fight we hit out as many men do and a growing number of men. My ex-husband explained after we had divorced that i was too good and made him feel bad because i took it and didn’t complain making him feel worse again. He respected me for a short time after he had strangled me. he sensed something different. For one he was being threatened by a five year old and this was only going to get worse. i was awake enough to work that out. but he had pushed some kind of button. i knew i was angry – i wanted to kill him and might have done if i had the means. his death was to be brought about in a certain way you see, to reflect the pain we suffered. But the means wasn’t the only problem! The kids would have had a dead father and a mother in prison so my parents would have got custody and i didn’t see that as good either.But after 8 weeks, he threw a 20 lb piece of metal at a work colleague and got suspended. he just had no control. His mother always controlled him you see. she was still hitting him round the face at 17/18 years old. He had been brought up with the knowledge that he had caused her nervous breakdown when he three or four years old. that is one hell of a burden to carry through a young life. I may have been the one to get retribution on his mother. We all have fear of our parents to some extent but we turn our backs on our gut instincts, our humanity in a quest to be everything to everyone. Everyone public wins because they get the nice, the family gets the other side! It was an obvious step forward from a child abused when on the cruise. Only i was in Turkey. i kicked the guy and cried as i ran after my chaperone’s who laughed at me for crying and being upset. i was most upset or scared that i had kicked an adult. i made friends with boys from another school. i don’t remember what the guy did or how far he got – denial. buried somewhere real deep that i can’t even use my training to get to it. For years i listened to my mother tell me that i hadn’t suffered what she had when she was a kid and she never gave me the opportunity. i became the failed high flyer after that cruise. she reminds frequently about that as well. There never was any discussion. She asked the question and flew off the handle and i guess i just learned to shut up. i didn’t trust her but i didn’t know how to trust myself either. It is only a couple of years that i told her why i didn’t drive until i was 30. Every time i pulled up at a junction, my driving instructor had his hand rubbing on the inside of my thigh. i took 18 lessons over a year, failed the test and never went back. On the way home from school, we had men in a van get a large dildo out and wave it at us and i was petrified. I was sexually assaulted at the swimming baths by a man and panicked at home. i pretended to be doing biology homework when i asked my father if we could get pregnant in water. I didn’t like asking my mother. I was at the swimming pool when i got kicked in the head. i made to the bus stop to get home and a boy from the nearby council estate recgonized i was in trouble. i was concussed, dizzy, couldn’t see and going green. he saw me home to my door whereupon i fell in and threw up! my father’s concern extended to “and what the hell was he doing here?” He couldn’t be missed as he had something wrong with his legs. But he had helped me, genuinely helped me and it went unrecognized because of where he lived, what his parents didn’t have, what disability he did have. What sense does that make. i guess what i am suggesting is that the arguments are multifaceted. but if we are to change the world, we need to teach our children to feel cared for by caring for them and not giving mixed messages because of our own fears about conventions, what people think etc. I learnt a long time ago that we only local news for a short time! the next victim isn’t far behind us, and they themselves will only be headline news for a short time! What i have learned from counselling training is that i never knew how to be cared for and it is hard being cared for sometimes – like accepting it when we have done something wrong or we feel bad about something which is usually beyond our control! That was pointed out to me by a counselling tutor – most of us are very hard on ourselves for things which we can do nothing about. It is a mixed up world because all the messages are mixed up. What do child groomers do? They are nice! They get the oxytocin running in their victims? What do conmen do? They are nice! They get the oxytocin running. What do wife beaters do? They get the oxytocin going and when they got us hooked, they become themselves. They all do! Perhaps we are all at it at some level but to my thinking if we are brought up feeling cared for, and with some degree of trust in ourselves then we will make different choices from being young to old. But we need to learn from the young, they set the best example and ultimately, we all want to feel liked, respected and valued. Let’s use that! "
"I work in a traditionally male-dominated field, and my particular workplace has had a dramatic shift towards gender balance over the last five years. There’s been no conscious attempt to make it this way — we’ve simply had a large volume of exceedingly well-qualified female applicants, which simply wasn’t the case in the past. A few weeks ago, I overheard one of my coworkers remarking to a colleague from another site that continues to be male-dominated, “It’s okay when there are only one or two women. But once you get too many…” I’m not entirely sure what he thinks the problem is with “too many” women. The women and men in this workplace contribute identically to the program. Those who have taken leaves of absence have been both men and women, for reasons both academic and parental. And the only weak staff, both those who have transferred to other jobs and those who remain on, have thus far only been male. So, I’m sorry about your workplace, sir. I’m sorry that the strong, intelligent, capable, responsible, innovative, hardworking, fun-loving co-workers you have to deal with happen to be both male and female. "

"Working in a freelance industry meant I had no maternity rights and so despite having worked for almost 8 years mostly for the same company as soon as I was visibly pregnant my work dried up. I was invited to the Baftas for a project that I had worked really hard on, but when I said I would have to pop out for 20 mins to feed my daughter, I was no longer invited and my place was given to someone else. As a freelancer, awards like this matter and I had earned my place to be there. I was discriminated against because I needed to feed my baby, and to discriminate for this reason is illegal. The majority of people in this industry are lovely and decent people, but the number of women in the industry is declining which means that what is produced has lost a female perspective. "
"In my current job, I worked my way up very quickly, as my boss values my hard work and dedication. For the past year I have been responsible for training our new staff and also our apprentices. One thing I have noticed over the past year is the male junior staff repeatedly ignore me and my authority. I have to include my boss (a male) on any emails to them just to get them to do what I’m asking. The apprentices in particular constantly try to correct me in areas they have not been trained in, despite me having 3 years experience in my position, and me being their manager. I half expected this kind of attitude from middle aged men, not 17-18 year olds straight out of education. I know this has absolutely everything to do with my gender and not my age (I am only 24) as I have no issues when training and managing the female junior staff, some who are much closer to my age and yet still respect my authority and experience.

"Yesterday, I was helping two French men while a Belgian man waited behind them. When the Belgian man heard the other two speaking French, he started conversing with them. My first language is English and I brightly mentioned that, despite not having studied French in 10 years, I could understand their conversation. How did the Belgian man respond? Why he sang, in a low, creepy tone and all, “Voulez-vous couchez avec moi?” of course. My smile and brightness instantly faded, the two French men looked away embarrassed, the entire atmosphere became an awkward one. . . and so the world keeps turning. "
1. Several times at work I’ve made a comment for a project and get no response only to have a man say it a few minutes later and everyone says it is a great idea. 2. Several men in the workplace simply ignore the work that I do and keep me out of the loop. 3. Honking horns and catcalls still occur when I am walking on the street just down to the store for a few items. 4. For some reason men keep touching my right shoulder. I don’t get it. I am finding this new pattern annoying. 5. It feels I must constantly be on guard these days with men. It sucks. Where’s the respect?

"I am a man who has experienced sexism in the workplace. When I asked my boss(also a male) to work in the lounge(because its a bigger section and you can make more money), he told me i needed more experience. How can I need more experience if I have been serving tables for 2 years. 10 months of which have been in that particular restaurant and all of my scores are higher than anyone else’s and I have more regulars than anyone else and also work the most hours than anyone else there. So I waited a couple more months and asked my manager about it again and he told me they were going to put a different server in there.

"My employer offers 2 months paid maternity leave to my wife and one week to me if I really insist. This not only deprives me of some leave with my child, it sets up a situation where the woman is forced to be the one to take the time off to care for an infant. This then creates a often documented scenario where women get discriminated against in the workplace because of taking maternity leave. If men and women were offered the opportunity to equally share maternity leave, I think it would lead to less negative impact on a woman’s career and signal a dramatic shift in the workplace away from the negative attitudes and career impediments that women face simply because they choose to have children (not to mention getting us guys off our butts to participate equally in child rearing) "
"I worked at a software company in 2000 as a software developer. When I was hired, the hiring manager told me that it was “not possible” to pay me more than a certain amount, and that “we make up the difference between programmer salaries and the prevailing wage” by giving annual bonuses at the end of the fiscal year to everyone who meets a certain metric. For the next three years, the owners of the company declined to give anyone an annual bonus, citing “financial difficulties”. I noticed that the owner of the company bought himself a brand new $75,000 sports car during these “financial difficulties”, but chalked it up to narcissism. Then I found out, almost by accident, that this software company – based in California, a state which outlaws wage or employment discrimination on the basis of sex – had been hiring young men with less than 1/4 of my experience as programmers for almost DOUBLE what they were paying me. These were men whom I trained and supervised! This company had been doing this all along: before they hired me and after they hired me. There was absolutely a “male wage” and a “female wage” at this company, despite this being completely illegal at both the state and federal level. Please note that this wasn’t in 1950, this was in 2000! Of course they went out of business and I was left with an important life lesson: just because a hiring manager pretends to be your “buddy”, eats vegetarian because he doesn’t like to hurt animals, wears Hawaiian-print shirts and sandals to work, talks about wanting his daughters to be “strong women”, does yoga and meditates in order to “raise his consciousness”, that doesn’t mean that he won’t also be a rabidly sexist sack of dirt when it comes to negotiating salaries with female employees. I am now a BRUTAL negotiator and walk away from any hiring manager whose opening offering to me is less than 105% of the prevailing wage for the position in my geographic area. I know I’m worth it based on my intelligence, education, skills and work performance. If he can’t figure it out through reading my resume, talking to me and checking my references, then I don’t want to work for him. I will never again accept being paid a “female wage”. I would quite literally prefer to starve. Only when women absolutely REFUSE to be taken advantage of in the workplace will this hideous form of sexism finally die away. "

I have walked into two meetings where I have been lied to about the agenda specifically to throw me off guard to weaken my position. The first time I was incredibly young and naive, the second time I was prepared but was interrupted and ultimately shut down by upper management and told to comply with the demands of my male colleagues.

Sitting on the train about two months ago- west midland service- and a lot of seats were free. Guy steps into the coach and chooses to sit next to me instead of taking any of the other free seats. For two hours he sat with his legs stretched apart so that they touched mine, making himself bigger and bigger and therefore touching me more whilst I pushed myself against the train window. I simply do not know why I did not get up. I felt so uncomfortable. Yet again, I thought maybe I am just making this up. Maybe I am just making a fuss. Waiting at a bus stop. It is night time. A guy walked in circles around the bus stop and whenever he passed me he hissed “hey sweaty… I want to fuck you..” 2 years ago, I met with a PhD friend to celebrate her successful viva. Her supervisor came along too. We went to an on campus bar to have a drink. Another lecturer and PhD colleague joined. I only drank water. The supervisor managed to sit next to me and started to – ever so slightly – touch my back and hips. I moved forward on the coach, moved away from his arm and hand, questioning whether I was overreacting, whether I could say something against him – given he was the supervisor of my friend. It got weirder when we left. He insisted on joining my friend and me back to our campus accommodations. I stopped at one hall where I did not live but I did not want him to know where my real flat was. He pulled me towards him and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I quickly walked away and hid in the hall. I thought about my actions and felt super stupid. Why did I not speak up? Why did I not stand up when I could feel him touching me? I simply argued it away in my head in terms of it would have been rude. After a week – I decided to tell my supervisor about this incident to explain to her why I did not want that lecturer to be my internal examiner. She was very supportive. We took it to a higher University level; which was a big mistake. I did not intend to cause the guy any problems, but wanted to warn other students not to get in such an uncomfortable situation. The higher instance – a middle aged guy – was not understanding. He asked me whether the touching was simply naive boyish behavior and whether it was my fault for wearing skirts. I was speechless. This was at a UK University. Once in London, I was going for a run in the morning – 7am. A guy appeared next to me – running with me. He asked “do you know what time it is”; I told him. He thanked me. Then it looked like he was about to change directions. Instead he let me run in front of him so he could slap my butt. When I turned around angry he did it again and then ran away. I was in complete shock. This happened at 7 am in the morning – in the middle of the street. The feeling of not being save anywhere was destroying. I had another bad encounter with a lecturer. I won’t go into details but it ended with a random girl asking me whether I felt save when I went to the pub bathroom. I told her that I felt stuck as this was a lecturer at my University, that I feel very uncomfortable but do not know how to exit the situation. She then offered me to help me out. When we went back to the table, she and her boyfriend said that they were heading to the tube and it is late and whether I want to join them now to get home safely. I said yes, jumped up and went outside with them. I couldn’t thank them enough. Very nice people. They spotted that I felt super uncomfortable and that this lecturer was pushing me into things I did not want to do (which I voiced towards him repeatedly saying that I am not interested). Another bad experience happened with a lecturer. I thought I was careful. I wanted to know more about a specific theory this person used in his research but my previous male lecturer experiences told me not to ask him for help. So I asked his supervisee whether he is an ok guy or whether I have to be worried. She said he is a good guy, nothing to worry about. To be even more careful, I asked another friend of mine to join me when meeting him. Luckily she agreed. We met in a public cafe. Nothing obvious happened – besides that this lecturer did not talk about his theory/model at all, although I kept asking him about it. Instead he kept saying how much he would like me to be his students, how great my research was, etc. After a while I gave up trying to get an answer to my questions and my friend and I left. My friend was deeply disgusted by this lecturer, saying that he so obviously tried to hit on me. I felt horrible and contacted his supervisee. She then confessed that she was about to change Universities because she felt uncomfortable with him. From that moment on, I kept my distance from male colleagues profs etc. whenever I feel only the slightest hint of discomfort which helped me when I changed Universities. For example, a new colleague wanted to meet for coffee. But the type of questions he asked me felt too personal and for my taste he did not leave me much personal space (with me moving away and he coming closer when we were walking). So I excused myself and walked away. I did not tell him that I felt uncomfortable and maybe he really didn’t have evil intentions. But I felt good to have escaped the situation. Whenever I see him now, I pay attention to be nice but keep my distance. So far it worked very well. I could add stories from my childhood, with a male neighbor who made my sister and me feel very uncomfortable and how my dad told us to be nice to the guy and not to be so sensitive. He touched my sister inappropriately and always demand to kiss my cheek. When we both were older my sister broke the silence and accused my parents for helping the neighbor to sexually harass her. My mum then confessed that she felt horrible for not having stood up for my sister. To the present day, my dad has not apologized to her. Thank you for this platform. It feels good to share this. "

"I work in a council run nursery in Falkirk with ante preschool and preschool children. The other day during Welcome Time, one of the little girls was telling everyone what she got for her birthday, “I got dinosaurs and Lego” The adult leading Welcome Time said, “You should have been a boy” and a second adult confirmed this belief by saying, “Yes, you should have been a boy”. None of this was said with sexist intent nor malice. But it was said and the damage was done. Sad to say, there were 5 adults in the room & only 2 could believed what was said was potentially damaging. "
"I am a Pilates teacher and had an older man in my classes for many years. He would make suggestive comments at times which annoyed me and made me feel really uncomfortable. One morning he touched my bottom and I angrily told him off and carried on with the class. At the end I asked him to stay so I could talk to him about it. After I had described how inappropriate and upsetting what he did was and he had nodded as he listened to me, he answered “Well it was just too tempting”. I felt so angry that I sent him an email telling him not to come back again. "
"For two years, I received unwanted advances from a male consultant at work in the form of unnecessary physical contact e.g.squeezing my sides, often wanting to shake my hand and then holding it for a protracted period of time; chaotic emails with comments on my appearance; and leaving cryptic notes in my office drawer. He is a middle aged man; I am a 30 year old newly married woman with absolutely no physical attraction towards him. At no time did I ‘lead him on’ or encourage this behaviour. I asked him to refrain from the excessive physical contact as it made me uncomfortable, I avoided being in proximity to him, reduced conversation to work only. He left my workplace seven months ago,in that time he has sent me inappropriate emails which have included details of photos that he has seen on my facebook profile (we have never been facebook friends but he had found my profile – I immediately blocked him and changed my name), details of how attractive he finds me etc but with cryptic and aggressive statements. He has txted and called me with unwanted messages; I have blocked him. He is now only able to contact me via my work email which he continues to do at least monthly despite me ignoring them. He is due to return to my workplace on a short term contract soon and I received a lusting and slightly aggressive nonsensical email last week from this man. Following advice from female colleagues, I decided to inform my male manager of the harassment that I have received from this man. My manager was broadly supportive and I provided examples. He discussed it with his male manager and I have since been informed that there is nothing that they can do, he is just a sad and lonely man. Is it ok to harass a woman just because you’re deemed sad and lonely?!? Apparently it is a personal issue and perhaps I should talk to someone at home about it. I have cut off all lines of communication that I can but I am helpless to do anything about my work email and cannot avoid this man coming back into my workplace. I am angry that he will not even have the code of conduct outlined to him before he recommences work or any,even brief, conversation regarding his harassment. Unsurprisingly, I work in a department which is less than 10% female with no senior female managers. "

"I was training in Massage Therapy, when a guy of a similar age who studied on the same course, asked me politely for my phone number. I gave it, naive to his intentions. During the course he started sending messages with content I had never had to contend with before. ‘I am just driving home, and am struggling with a hard-on just thinking about you’. I never reciprocated or replied, but somehow felt responsible, so told no one. I dodged working with him as we had to partner up to practice the massage routines. I mentioned in the morning of the last day of the course, how he was acting, to another female colleague and she took it straight to the leader of the course. Within an hour or so, he (the leader) had kicked the guy off the course. For weeks later, the guy (who’s number I deleted – but knew by heart by now) texted me ‘how could you be so sensitive, it was only banter, I had been waiting for a girl like you, but now I know you were like the rest, I thought this course would have got me ‘in’, at least I still have the skills…’ That last remark still terrifies me. What also does, is that this occurrence has happened more times than I care to remember, in different courses (acting, writing etc) so it seems to me, whatever the circumstance, if you are willing to learn (and in some way, to do so, you must be open, perhaps even vulnerable) there appears to be someone who is willing to take advantage.

These were their responses: I can’t hire a woman because I want to say “cunt” or swear whenever I want; “I would never hire a woman – her tits might distract me”; “Womem would not cope with the all men team”; “I can’t hire a woman – she might cry”: On the last one, I pointed put that I never cry at work and am treated no differently to the men, but he laughed and said “you’re different” "
"Yesterday evening I was at work, bagging groceries. A man entered the checkout line and looked at me creepily in the way a lot of harassers and predators do, but it only lasted a moment before he stopped and focused on the transaction, so I didn’t walk away as I’ve been doing with suspicious customers. However, at the end of the transaction when he came to get his bags, he started teasing me out of the blue. I’m so sick of this sort of thing happening (I’ve submitted several similar stories on this site) and I wasn’t going to take it anymore so I told him to go to hell, then walked away. He got mad and complained at customer service, then went home, got his wife, and came back with her so they could both complain, even though the wife had nothing to do with it. Later I was pulled into the manager’s office, lectured about how the company’s money is more important than my dignity and self-respect, and sent home early. I don’t regret what I said. I found out today that I’m not going to get fired, but even if I did I would have no regrets. I stood up for myself – and it felt great to make the harasser mad for once, instead of letting him walk away laughing. I hope he and his wife are mad forever. This is getting to the point where I might just try to avoid all men. Not because I think they’re all harassers, but because there’s no way to know which ones are harassers until it’s too late. Oh yes, and I may add that I asked the male cashier I’d been bagging for if the customer had said anything of the sort to him, and he said no. "
"My employer has a clear salary policy. It states the starting salary, competency salary and upper limit salary for each employment ‘band’. You are supposed to automatically jump up to competent one year after your commencement date (assuming no negative feedback in your annual appraisal or concerns with your performance/behaviour). For my band, this is approx a 6% payrise. I discovered this policy after 14 months of employment. I went to my linemanger (male) to request my payrise. He said he would investigate, and reported back that there wasn’t any allowance for it in the budget. Why was the budget planned without this allowance? I never received an answer on this. I then found out that a colleague (male, same employment band, very similar function and prev experience requirements, lesser responsibilities and smaller workload, considerably less competent than me (evidenced by my line manager asking me to clean up his mess on several occasions), with slightly shorter service than me, working in the same directorate so under the same budget), had been granted his raise after asking for it the first time. I went back to my manager and requested my payrise again, and was rejected again, despite me making this comparison. I asked for my manager to invest in my pursuing the various professional qualifications we had discussed at my interview and he had (verbally) agreed to support. Apparently they is no budget for this either. And I didn’t have the agreement in writing. My colleague, however, has had an entire professional qualification training paid for my our employer. It’s not even a requirement for his role. My line manager then sacked one of the temp contractors we were using on a project for incompetency. This man was on Â£550/day. He was not replaced despite his assumed costs having been planned for in the budget for several more months. The payrise I was requesting and was due as per the policy would have been Â£2,000/year; the training would have been Â£600. I asked for either again, and was turned down again, because apparently there is still no money in the budget. I have now found a new job. It is a Â£15,000/year salary increase and they have stated in writing that they will financially support me through the qualifications. My line manager was genuinely surprised that I was looking and that I have accepted it. It costs my current employer approx Â£3,000 each time to recruit to a new role (calculated as the cost of everyone’s time to sift, interview, etc plus the HR time). Then they have the costs of training up a new person and having someone not yet up to speed in a critical role. It would have been cheaper and easier, as well as simply being fair and right, for them to have just given me my damn payrise as I was due. I genuinely think it’s because I am female that I was refused. My colleague’s and my roles are pretty much identical on paper, we have the same management and our salaries are paid for from the same budget. My job description specifically mentions particular qualifications, and his doesn’t. And I know that I am better than him because of feedback from our manager. But I am female and he is male. "
"I don’t know how it happened, I guess in part because as a teenages I was a freak in school and I found TV disgusting most of the time.

Now I usually dress up so that I feel comfortable, and I have absolutely no need to use make up.

"Where do I start? When I was 16 I was in a fashion design competition. The national competition was (unfortunately) held in a casino. There were girls there as young as 13 years old being ogled by old men. We were afraid to even walk to our hotel rooms alone. Also when I was 15-16, I moved to a very urban area. Suddenly, I was being honked at, yelled at, gestured at, and even more! This wasn’t just once or twice, this was every. single. day. When I was seventeen, I was taking the train to a dentist appointment, talking to my mother who was sitting right across from me. A man sat down beside me (no big deal, it was a free seat, go right ahead), after a couple of minutes, I noticed that his hand was slipping constantly closer to my thigh. Thankfully my mother noticed as well and quite obviously stuck her leg up on the seat between the man’s hand and my thigh. Unfortunately, when we went to get off the train, the man started to follow us. It made me so afraid that we actually ran to our next train and hid in a crowd in hopes that the man wouldn’t see us (he didn’t and we haven’t seen him since). I work at a grocery store and EVERY DAY I get men who try to stare down my top, joked at about being “young and pretty”, stares at my butt, or even something as small as being told “that’s heavy, here let me take it” then turning a blind eye when my male coworker goes to lift something equally heavy. Why is this ok! I can’t even walk through my workplace after a certain time because I am made uncomfortable by a man my dad’s age! Yet I can’t say anything because he hasn’t physically done anything! Even my youngest sister when she was 13 was being stared at by men 3-5 times her age! Why is this ok? My dream is to become a pilot, but I am scared because I know that I will be sexually harassed and assaulted every day! I can’t go out in the evening with friends because I know I could be raped.

"I worked as a waitress at a family owned pizza store when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I worked with a man in his early thirties, he was married, with two children and was the son of the owner of the store. I don’t know how it all begun, I have never spoken about it before, to anyone, so I think for the most part I’ve blocked the whole memory out, but he would whisper obscene things into my ear during my shifts, that he wanted to have sex with me, how he would have sex with me, what he would do to me and my body, in absolute explicit detail. I remember I was petrified every time he would say something, I would shake, and my skin would crawl, but I never knew what to do, so I would stand there in silence, petrified, wedge myself against anything near me, in an attempt to escape and shield myself. He would only do it when I was alone, bending over washing dishes he would come up behind me, stroke my hair and whisper in my ear, he would see me shake and see I was uncomfortable, and find it humorous, the fact he was sexually harassing me seemed humorous to him. And every single time I said nothing, and did nothing, I stood there like a stunned mullet, and when we would make eye contact afterwards, I would smile, hang my head and hurry off. I spent my entire working life avoiding him. It progressively got worse, he would then create circumstances where him and I would be alone and work one on one, he would brush my hand when I walked past him. I remember feeling so guilty for his wife and children, I would see her on occasions and I felt like I was going to throw up. I was too scared to tell anyone because I felt I would be making a fuss and people would think I wanted the attention, that no one would believe me, that maybe his wife wouldn’t believe me and get angry at me, that people might think I’m a whore, so I continued on saying nothing. I would think about the situations over and over again, the guilt would kill me, and then I would interpret the situation as a fault of my own, that maybe because I didn’t say anything to begin with that it was my fault, that he interpreted it as me giving him consent, because I wasn’t a virgin, it didn’t matter, I should be use to this, this is what it’s like. I remember I stopped wearing makeup to shifts, would stuff my hair in a hat, wear larger shirts and try and extinguish any kind of sex appeal, thinking it would deter him and how I looked was the reason he would do what he did, my image is what validated what he did and it was up to me to make sure he wasn’t a sexual deviant and to make sure I wasn’t a victim. I took complete ownership of the situation, total blame, because I wear makeup, that’s why he’s doing it, because I straightened my hair, that’s why he’s doing it. I never told a soul of my experience, even after I left. I always thought it was never particularly relevant, because no real physical contact happened it wasn’t sexual harassment, his words don’t count as sexual harassment, only touching and serious instances do, as if he fell through some kind of loop hole and how there are bigger problems in the world that people are going through and any one I told would tell me to lighten up, get over it and the Police would simply just think I was making a fuss and wasting their time, I didn’t want to bother anyone, I thought my particular situation wasn’t worthy of speaking up about, almost thought it was normal, although every part of me ached and the guilt kept me awake most nights, I didn’t want to make a fuss and I was too scared of the ramifications. It took me a very long time to step foot near that pizza store again, it’s since come under new management and I believe he has now left. I am a lot stronger now in my twenties, I can see how my situation wasn’t normal, wasn’t right and he should be locked up in jail, but being a sixteen year old girl, intimidated, the thought of complaining scared me. I have come a long way, I am now an activist for women’s rights and equality, I am surrounded by generous, kind, respectful men in my workplace and social life, and I know the difference between how I should be treated and how I shouldn’t, my self worth has grown, and I would never allow another man to disrespect me like he did. I now regret not saying anything, not just for me, but for all the other women this person may harass, and for the pain that could result from him, I regret it for her, I can’t sleep thinking of how she might feel because of him. He deserves to be locked away. But, I love my life now, I have an amazing family, amazing social circle and all the men I know respect me and celebrate me and would be appalled to know what this man did. I suppose the morale of my story is the hopes to connect with fellow women who have lived the situation I have, I don’t want them to feel alone in your battles and triumphant. For all the women in this situation now, you’re beautiful, and of immense worth, and no one can ever treat you this way, don’t allow the idea of creating a scene stop you, create a scene, talk to someone, scream and shout if need be, because you are worth it, you have support, you deserve better, you are better and there is better.

"My thesis considered gender inequality in the workplace and this is a personal passion of mine as well. I carried out an observation in a restaurant where the level of sexism shocked me. Women were interrupted and teased. They were referred to as ‘girls’ and gendered conversations made females come across as weak and vulnerable. One male even spoke of rape as a humorous topic. Furthermorem, my friend Amy runs her own business and we often discuss gender equality together as she works in a male-dominated area. When customers approach the business they often bypass Amy and speak straight to her father or partner, assuming the male runs the business. This website is such a good idea – sexism is often masked as humour, but this is part of the problem! I believe that gender inequality exists in every aspect of social life, from Eastenders to toys. Have you ever noticed how successful career women in soaps are portrayed as cold and bitchy? Maternity and paternity policies are another source of inequality for women – allowing assumptions to be made about child care. I could write a whole book! "

"My ex boss and I were chatting with an 8 year old boy as we worked. He asked the kid what he wanted to do when he grows up and the boy replied that he wanted to be a footballer. My boss said ‘Yeah? So you can get all the best women!’ I was sick of comments like this from him and horrified that he was sharing these attitudes with a child so I said ‘you think the ‘best women’ are the ones who go for footballers?’ (not quite the point I wanted to make but I was stunned by his comment) and he actually looked confused for a minute and said ‘well… the best looking ones.’ Thankfully the little boy looked baffled by the whole thing and said that he just liked playing the game… I mean he was EIGHT years old! … and I was able to move on chatting to him about that. The same boss also told my workmate while carrying a cabinet together that if she kept leaning over like that he’d drop his side (she wasn’t even wearing an especially revealing top, not that that is the point). When I stayed overnight for my trial shift (it was a remote area) he told me not to tell his wife that I had stayed in their guest room… the next day he said he’d told her but it was ok because ‘she knows I’m working too much and too tired to do anything anyway’ … I just didn’t know what to say and the work experience felt too valuable to pass up. Finally on my last day with him he shoved me hard because he wanted me to move and I hadn’t done so immediately because I needed to sort out a safety issue where I was (I worked on a boat so this was pretty urgent at times). I instinctively turned and hissed ‘for fuck’s sake’ and he backed off but then I had to carry on giving a presentation to a large group of people while trying not to cry with shock and rage. I felt like I couldn’t say anything about these incidents because I needed a reference so he is still out there, behaving how he wishes to his (mostly young, attractive female) staff. I consider myself fairly tough and an outspoken feminist but needing job experience and a good reference led me to put up with this sort of treatment, and I can see from reading thousands of other entries that many others feel the same pressure to let such incidents go. This makes me so angry and frustrated at the society we live in. Reading your stories and your brave comments has inspired me meet sexism and harassment with anger rather than fear when outside of work (thank you) but pressure to be submissive in the workplace is a huge issue. Thank you for reading this rant- at least here I have a platform to share the rage I felt I had to suppress at the time. Laura, this is a wonderful creation. "
"Not only is sexism, in the workplace, educational institutes, home, public places etc., a problem but it is also extremely hard for older women. We face sexism and ageism. I have a business degree and have worked in senior management for 26 years. Now that I am in my early sixties I cannot even get a job as a receptionist. I am too old. I am obsolete. I am useless. When men get to their 60s they are considered mature and supposedly bring a world of experience to an organization. Not women. We are faced with ageism. Even retail outlets treat me differently. Men are more ‘handsome and mature’ as they age. Women get wrinkles and sagging. We become ugly and old even though we may have a youthful attitude. Society looks at us as worn out. As aged out. As useless women. The makeup counters at large department stores avoid my eye now instead of trying to sell me their products. Clothing stores rarely cater to anything but youth. I went into a pub in downtown Vancouver for lunch and was ignored and served after a table of young people came in after me. They got their order taken first and they got their food before me. And then I am criticized if I don’t tip- TIP stands for ‘To Insure Promptness’. So as we age we face sexism and ageism. "
At a meeting of a Regional Flood and Coastal Committee. The chair suggested the committee should recruit more female members to improve the diversity of the committee. A member representing a local authority responded with a dismissive comment that women “had only just been let out of the kitchen”. He was rebuked by the chair but is still a member of the committee. And I bet it won’t be minuted either. And we’re trying to encourage more girls into science and engineering…

"A couple of years ago I went for a Professorship which everyone thought I would get- given I had teaching awards, top research rating and world class rating for impact and was over retirement age. The emphasis though was on how candidate would attract new research monies which I didn’t at the interview stress, having stupidly thought my achievements would speak for themselves and because it was my last year of teaching so it wouldn’t cost them much and because I thought it crating a supportive atmosphere for my colleagues who had felt devalued would be the best way to encourage more research applications. In the event, my two younger male colleagues were promoted over me, much to their embarrassment . At the time I blamed myself for not being savvy enough to read the runes and tailor my interview presentation accordingly. And that is partly true but on reflection I think there was sexism within the structure and in the way I was perceived. For though there were managerialist women who did succeed to high position in the institution, the managerialist model is implicitly very masculinist. The sort of work I did, though academically rigorous, was politically engaged, organic and people-focused. . I was always told how highly valued my work was but it didn’t translate into formal recognition of a Chair. I retired soon after and was subsequently was accorded an honorary professorship by a more prestigious university which was somewhat of a recompense (though significantly it was a female head of department who supported that and helped to make it happen).

"Let me just preface this by saying that, looking back, it probably began earlier, but I can say for sure that I’ve experienced regular sexism since the age of 8. That’s when the boy next door, whose childish affections I did not return, began hitting, hitting on, and assaulting me on a regular basis. He & his friend would follow me when I came over to play with his sisters (he had two, one my age, one the same age as my own younger sister) and scare or annoy them till they took off, then try to push me down on a mattress or the floor, to touch me. I fought, and yelled, and never got any help. Sometimes they just tried to kiss me, or hung around asking me disgusting sex questions. The worst part of all was that when I told adults or my older siblings that he was bothering me, had tried to kiss or touch me and wouldn’t leave me alone, they all said variations on the theme of “The lady doth protest too much” and “someone has a boyfriend” or they sang that annoying song about two kids sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g. They made fun of me for liking someone, while ignoring what I was saying about him, and my stated feelings for him. It went on for years. And I hated him, for what he did, and more for what was implied about my character in all the reactions to my reaction to him. I guess I’m lucky that I held on to my anger, because otherwise I might have become an abused wife, with that kind of negative reinforcement. That was a long time ago, and it would be impossible to catalog all of the sexism I’ve experienced since, which ranges from being made to think from grade school on that being a girl meant I couldn’t succeed in science or math, to having co-workers try to get me drunk at a holiday party so the manager of another department could paw me while they all left the room. The next day I turned down a date with the guy; and less than 8 hours later, I was “laid off” for not making my quotas– when I had made them. Yesterday I turned 53 and I could go on and on telling stories. It has been continuous since childhood, whenever I walk outside my door, and often when I don’t. Even with a wonky memory, I could fill a book with detailed incidents of sexism & sexual harassment in school, at work, at home, in shops, out in the world, here on my computer. Hell, when I borrowed my hubby’s laptop recently, the first thing I noticed was that the pop-up & banner ads there are all about the hot girls he could be fucking, or the hot girls in online games that he could be manipulating; mine are about how I could be losing weight faster, how I could get plastic surgery to look younger, etc. We’re targeted for different vulnerabilities. But as a woman, I’ve been targeted non-stop. Whether it was having the father of children I was regularly babysitting strut naked into the living room one night, pretending he hadn’t known I was there yet, or having most of the people at my second university campus assume I was fucking my younger male best friend despite our denials; because why else would a 20 year old guy hang out with a 30-ish woman– it couldn’t be because they had similar backgrounds & interests, could it? Here’s another work one: after a female customer complained because her husband had looked at me while I was serving their table, I was given instant probation at Pizza Hut for not wearing a bra (not mentioned in the dress code at that time), when the SOP was to have three written warnings before ANY verbal warning or further action was taken. I was told by my female manager, who had never noticed in the almost three years I’d worked there that I didn’t wear a bra (along with at least five other female employees, because it meant you had to wash your bra every day you worked to get the grease smell out and we were all students so who could afford that), that it was “unhygienic.” I asked why the male employees weren’t also required to wear bras, then, because my nipples didn’t ooze any special secretions I knew of; and on any given day, it was unlikely that all of the guys were even wearing underwear (true). She told me it was because of my “big floppy tits.” I gave notice on the spot and wore a bra to work for my last two weeks. For any of the work incidents (and the dozen ones I haven’t mentioned) I could have tried to file charges, but without money to back me up, I knew that being a pretty young woman was not a plus in fighting sexual harassment. Previous experiences of not being taken seriously made that choice perfectly clear. "

I work evenings in a supermarket and walk to/from my job. I have two options for my commute: walk through an unlit park which is much quicker and quiet or along a main road past two pubs. I choose the park as I feel safer going that way as the only people there are folks going home/dogwalkers and as it’s quiet I can hear clearly even if I have headphones on. Much nicer than going past pubs full of drunk men! However many of my male colleagues feel it is appropriate to tell me to change my route home because it makes them uneasy! Even though I feel safest that way

Men will think you want it” “She doesn’t mind” “Why do you wear so much makeup? men like natural girls” “Wear makeup! Men like girls who look pretty” “You’ll never get a man looking like that” “Who you trying to impress” “Look at them tits!” “Look girls like you won’t be what you want be” “Pretty simple, girls are dumb” “May as well know this now, if you don’t grow some boobs you won’t get very far” “Men like thick girls” “She’s moody, must be her time of the month” “I’d let her sit on my face” “Don’t drink too much, you’re vulnerable” “I bet Â£5 you can’t get off with her” "

Dad’s solution: stop studying, don’t take the exams, after all, I was engaged to be married. I’m now a chief finance officer, still married, and a proud mum.

"I’ve just come across this via a Facebook link and I’m so pleased to see a place where women can write down their experiences of sexism and misogyny – I’ve experienced both over the years and it’s cathartic in a way to be able to anonymously talk about incidents (my husband either doesn’t want to hear or thinks I’m overreacting). From prolonged sexual assault aged 11 years by an older brother; boys on bikes grabbing my breasts as I was walking up the road with 2 bags of groceries, men who think it’s ok to grab you through the legs from behind, policemen thinking it’s ok to say a ‘strip search might be in order lads’ or being told by a senior police officer at a social event that ‘you have great boobs’, male colleagues being physically and sexually intimidating – being pulled into empty rooms, held against the wall demanding a kiss, a 6ft 4inch man (and almost as wide) standing in the doorway of my office so that I couldn’t get out, visiting a so-called male friend and being physically restrained and told ‘you know you want it’, being stalked by a bus driver, being verbally and physically threatened by a man who shouted I had taken his parking space on a busy road in the city – he was going to pull me out of the car and kick the car in if I didn’t move; I did move and reported him to the police who traced him through his registration number and, guess what, according to him, I was the one at fault! As I’ve got older I come across it less as I won’t put up with any s*** and I can now spot the type a mile off, also, being older has its advantages – generally you’re off the radar! My aim for my granddaughters is that they learn to be assertive from an early age (which they are) don’t put up with any ‘bloke’ talk that makes them feel uncomfortable even though it makes them appear ‘humourless’ and to tackle intimidating behaviour head-on.

"I’m a teacher in a higher education establishment. A senior male colleague there (in terms of both position and age – fyi I am in my early 30s), who I’ve known but not that well for a few years, has always been very friendly and helpful towards me and addressed me by my first name whenever we’ve met, as I have him. However, I committed a minor offence the other day: I forgot to clear the Interactive Whiteboard when I left the classroom. n.b. I’ve only been using them for a month and it slipped my mind. Anyway, he must have been in the classroom after me and had to close down the windows I’d left open – maybe 3 or 4 – i.e. 10 seconds of non-physical effort, no biggie, but a little irritating for about the time it takes to close them, I suppose. I’ve found less high tech classrooms left in far worse states, cleaned up, and forgotten about it – it’s par for the course in the profession, really. Hours later, he approached me, and said ‘Ms [my surname].’ A little surprised, I said, ‘Hello [X}, yes, that’s my name, how are you?’ In a condescending, slightly menacing tone, he said, ‘Do you remember how you left the IWB when you were teaching in the classroom?’ I said, ‘Err, not really?’ and he said ‘No, clearly not,’ and then proceeded to patronizingly tell me off as if I was some kind of naughty child, not a colleague who had made a trivial mistake that teachers tend to do now and then. Really humiliating. He’d had plenty of time to decide how to approach me, so his intention was definitely to put me in my place over something quite ridiculous in the grand scheme of things. Would he have done the same to a male teacher my age? I think it’s unlikely. I know it’s trivial and far worse things have happened to me, but it’s not what I expect in my workplace and at my age. "
I complained to the police about a male who was stalking me and the response I got was he has a right to drive around in a place at the same time as you. He had just been released from jail and was on bail for robbing a bank. I gave all the peoples names that he sexually assaulted to the police and not one of them or another person said they believe me. The sexual assault centre discharged me numerous times on the basis that I was apparently doing well. I have reason to believed that I am being stalked at least on occasion and it has been more than ten years since the first incident.

There was an older customer there who had repeatedly crossed the line, but because it was a job and I needed to make money, I just laughed it off. But this night, he pulled me onto his lap by my breast and then asked me very loudly how I masturbated. He continued on with this, working to get the entire restaurant involved. I would walk to tables with couples and the man would then ask me how I masturbated and the woman would ignore it or tell him to knock it off. No one stood up for me – the cook even got involved. The next day, I told the managers what happened. I was thankful that they stayed that night until the man came in. I shook when I poured his coffee. When he asked me what was wrong, I told him and my voice shook too. He looked upset and said, “I only thought we were having fun.” "

"Last night I was talking with a female and two male colleagues. My female colleague revealed that she was a national Karate champion (second place) and that the girl who beat her deserved to win, as she was much better than her. The two men spent the next 10 minutes mansplaining to her why she should beat men up if she can because ‘it’s awesome that she’s able to do that.’ When she explained that Karate isn’t about beating people up, they explained that she should anyway. They then mansplained why she shouldn’t be so self deprecating in relation to her her opponent, the national champion. I kept quiet for a long time, wanting to come to her aid, but not wanting to upset the evening. Eventually I had to say something. I tried to be unconfrontational, but call it out. The two men then shouted over me (and her as she came to my aid), mansplaining why they aren’t sexist. When I eventually stopped the conversation because it was going nowhere, one of them accused me of offending his sister, mother and grandmother. Sometimes I feel like giving up. "
"I was on the bus to work a few months back when an argument erupted between the (female) bus driver and a (female) passenger due to the driver asking the passenger to move her mini-suitcase which was blocking the aisle. The passenger refused and started shouting abuse at the driver, using disgusting language. It got to the point where the driver stopped the bus and asked her to get off but she refused and continued to give a torrent of abuse so the driver called the police. We were waiting for the police to arrive and several passengers started talking to the passenger, asking her to apologise to the driver and saying that they were “just as bad as each other”. Eventually another bus pulled up behind us and as we got onto it the (male) bus driver said “oh she should have just ignored her and got on with her job”. Now I was annoyed as everybody else about the interruption to my journey but I completely supported the actions that the driver took. At the end of the day the driver shouldn’t have to put up with that level of abuse from a passenger while she is simply doing her job. Her colleague should have supported her, not told her to “get on with it”, likewise the other passengers should have been more sympathetic instead of getting annoyed that their journey was delayed. It shocks me how this abuse of a woman simply doing her job was normalised, the other passengers and the male bus driver seemed to think that she should just put up with the abuse and get on with it. I have worked in customer service before, and I would not have put up with that level of abuse. I’m now a criminal prosecutor and know that she had every right to call the police. It makes me wonder what would have happened had the passenger and driver been of different genders? If the abusive passenger had been a man would the same approach have been taken? Similarly if the driver had been a man I reckon the second driver would probably have backed him up, not said he should just “get on with it”. "
I am 29 year old woman who started work at a new company last year. A 65 year old man makes non stop sexist and innappropriate remarks to me. HR’s response was ‘ well there are two sides to every story’. Here are a few examples of his behaviour: 1. He asked me what colour dress I was wearing to the work Christmas part because ‘ he doesn’t mind my underwear being black but doesn’t want me to wear a black dress because he’ll be wearing a black suit’. 2. He asked me which of the men in his team at work could inspect my underwear. When I didn’t join in with his banter he remarked ‘its not like a girl from Liverpool to not want to show her underwear’ 3. When I had to approach him in the workplace he got a pair of binoculars out if his pocket ( I kid you not) and stared at my chest until I reached him. On another occasion I was showing a male colleague how to do something on excel and another man said in front of the entire meeting ‘ I never thought I’d see the f#%Â£ng day a woman showed you how to use a computer’ The weirdest thing is that everybody apart from me seems to think this is acceptable. I work for a company which operates in over 75 countries so it’s not some ignorant little set up in the sticks. Totally beggars belief

"When I was 25, I worked for a construction company where it was mandatory for all employees to attend a course on manual handling (safe lifting, basically). It was a half day course and held in the storage warehouse. I was the only woman there. I was employed as an administrator so perhaps it was a fair comment from the instructor when he said to me “I don’t know why you’re here because you won’t be lifting anything heavier than a piece of paper”, rolling his eyes. He then proceeded to tell me to pick up a 15kg bag of gravel from a wheelbarrow and stack it on a pile. His wink to the men on the course didn’t go unnoticed by me. He was trying to humiliate me and at that point hadn’t taught us anything about safe lifting. He wanted me to get it wrong so he could use me as an example of what not to do, or perhaps he wanted me to struggle with lifting what he considered to be a heavy weight. So of course I pick up said bag of gravel and move it to the stack as requested. What he didn’t know is that while I might have been employed as office staff, my background was in working with horses and I owned 3 who I looked after myself. I knew all about safe lifting and was used to throwing around 20kg bags of feed, bags of bedding at around 25kg and bales of hay weighing up to 30kg. A 15kg bag of gravel was nothing to me. He was gobsmacked for a moment before telling the guys that I’d just delivered a perfect demonstration and could they all just do what I did. He then told me that I didn’t need to take the course, he would give me an automatic pass, and I could go back to my job. I like to think he learnt something that day ðŸ˜‰ "

"I recently reconnected with my old boss so I had worked for abroad via LinkedIn as was looking for new opportunities having relocated . He responded quite quickly and arranged to meet up to discuss potential avenues. In person it was fine but then came all the messages, vulgar texts asking for photos, insinuating all sorts of ideas. He claimed it was all “banter”. I was then asked to attend a work event and as I was looking for a new career move I attended extremely apprehensively but thought what harm could be done in a public place. Again all was fine and then when I left the messages began again. When I called him out for his behaviour and told him to leave me alone from then on he began quoting women are from Venus and men are from mars, telling me that I don’t give anything and that there are two type of piles in his office “the easy to do” and two hard to do”. The bullshit messages continued trying to make me look emotionally unstable and sensitive because I had rejected a married mans sexual advances. It’s so disheartening to know that regardless of ability because of appearance and gender that this continues to happen and by standing up for myself and morally what is wrong I am then made to look emotionally unstable and incompetent .

One night I was helping out collecting glasses- because it was after my working hours I was in regular clothes instead of uniform- when an older man I’ve never even seen before suddenly grabbed me from behind and shoved his hand at my crotch. I was stunned that someone would do something like that, I’m rather timid and still young and so had no idea what to do. Luckily some men who come into the bar and I serve and talk to regularly saw what was happening and grabbed the man and threw him outside, they made sure I wasn’t hurt and then took me to my sister and boss where I can say I cried for a solid 15 minutes. I was just doing extra work to try and boost my Uni funds, I didn’t realise my age and clothing would attract such attention. I can honestly say that I’m now more scared to go to Uni where I wont have regular customers or my sister or boss to rely upon when this happens again. It was really scary and I had no idea what to do, young girls (and boys) should be taught what to do in these situations when they start high school. "

For the last two years, I had walked miles once a week to volunteer at a nearby special needs school, then walked miles back to be back in school by the end of break (I started the day on a double free period), I had been elected as a house captain and worked hard for my school community, also having a regular column in the school newsletter. I also worked very hard in my studies and was predicted excellent grades. The teacher read over my application, and said it was fine, and should get me accepted by my University. I left happy enough. A boy in my year, we’ll call him Kane, was applying for the same University at the same course, but because, he said it would be an ‘easy’ job. He was a regular truant, and when I saw him go to show the teacher his application, I asked what feedback he had and if I could have a look at his application. We exchanged and read one another’s. He had no extra curricular activities, poor attendance and no work experience. He said ‘Wow, yours is really good. The teacher said mine was great and that I would probably be head teacher in five years.’ He wasn’t joking. "
"– When my uncle would, as a joke, grab me, put me across his lap, bare my butt and spank me while singing “Pe calul balan” which translates to sth like “On the white horse” even though I told him to let me go. I tried laughing and not making a fuss about it but I secretly hated him with burning anger in my mind. He already was an intruder to me since he married my aunt. I felt humiliated and I was also 8. I didn’t know if I had the right to not like it or to feel bad about it. I still hate him to this day and despise him for being an asshole most of the time to everyone. – My dad told me that women are beautiful if they had long hair and that men don’t really like them otherwise. I told him that “so that’s it, one day I have long hair and someone starts liking me, so if I decide to cut it the other day, then he’ll leave me cause that was my only worth? What? Then I’d rather cut my hair and if someone likes me like that, good, if not that’s that.” He told me it’s my business if I don’t want anybody to like me. (my dad is a really nice person, but unfortunately he also grew up with these kind of ideas. Don’t even get me started on my mom.) – As a child I was very innocent for my age. Some would even call me naÃ¯ve or childish, but I had a notion of living life that most of the adults I know still don’t have. I was 10 or 12yo and making my way back home from school one day (not more than a 7 minute trip) when I passed an older boy/ young man who I now assume was either renovating or was working part time in constructions. He was carrying a few construction materials and when he was about to pass by me, he called out to me like he wanted to ask me a question. I was a timid person, but I stopped thinking that maybe I could help with something. My parents never really stressed the importance of “stranger danger”. He asked me how much I it would cost to fuck meâ€¦ It felt so crude. I was just dumbstruck and didn’t know how to react to this. I stood there frozen and looked at him for a few seconds unmoving, like he just violated my trust or something, and then speed walked away feeling shameful and thinking that I somehow looked dirty. I think I even shouted at him that he was a stupid idiot (and felt stupid and guilty myself for that) while walking away. I got home and cried for some time hiding away from my mother because I didn’t want to seem weak. I felt disgusted with myself. I was depressive at the time. It was one brick added to my fragile, plummeting self esteem. I want to mention that I was basically a walking stick. I’m 21 now and I still look younger than my age. I didn’t even have boobs or ass or anything developed then. – Last year, in my first year of University, I was walking with my friend in broad daylight on a running lane along a small river in a populated area. We were eating cheese pie with parsley (my favorite thing ever) and as we walked we started hearing grunting and moaning sounds getting more and more audible. On the other side of the river, 5 meters from us was a guy jerking off in the open without inhibitions like it was Christmas. My friend had the luck of me seeing it first and I told her to not look. The damn shit ruined the food for me and I started yelling at him that he looked like a gross pathetic gorilla in heat and to get a room and I was so angry. I really wanted to eat that parsley cheese pie in peace. – My homeroom teacher scolded me in 5th grade that I had a tee shirt which had cropped shoulders (it was showing just a bit of them) and she told me to cover them up or I would have to leave. Like I didn’t even understand why the fuck shoulders would even be inappropriate… – I was working my first job as a waitress at a hotel open only during summer. An older patron started making nasty comments that I was incompetent to which I responded with humor or let them pass. At some point he got up and took the tray out of my hands and proceeded to show me how to properly hold it (I have a waiter’s diploma. I took a course.) I explained to him patiently that I have weak wrists and can’t carry it in one hand, even though I demonstrated that I did know what the proper way was. I don’t think he was expecting me to say anything cause he dismissively told me to leave this job if I couldn’t do it right. He seemed pretty uneducated judging by his manners and vocabulary, yet he still got the guts to talk. It was a particularly stressful day, I was the only serving person in the whole hotel and that was just the last drop. I’d like to say that I went and confronted him, but I actually went to the bathroom and rage cried for about five minutes before trying to recompose myself. My boss had a word with him (she’s a woman) and his companions later came and apologized about it. Obviously not him. "
"I was a part of the Navel Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) in high school and at the time I was the only girl in my class. On cadet of a lower rank, let’s call him Doe, kept describing sexual acts and making inappropriate comments to me. Mostly I eccnored it, I was too focused on advancing in rank and studying for the upcoming tests. Sometimes I would respond in an unemotional and stoic manner, asking him to stop, escalelating into anger when he prosissted. Eventually the Commanding Officer, an upperclassman, cought wind of what was going on and very publicly stripped the guy of his rank in front of the XO, Command Master Chief, and the other cadets. I thought that was the end of it. A few years later we were in the same class again and this time he had his eyes set on the Commander’s daughter. He’d make his comments about how nice he though she looked and how he’d do things to her if he could. Again he found himself in hot water. This time the Commanding Officer was a girl and most of the staff was in the same class and they saw the whole thing. He was kicked out and banned from re-entering the program. That wound be the end of the story but we had met one more time after all of this. I was a work, a entry level job as a casher at a local fast food restraunt. I was graduated now and working on getting money to pay for school. It was in that slow dead period of the day between the lunch rush and the after school rush. Me and my mannager were talking about the latest super hero movie to come out (I think at the time it was Deadpool) when Doe came in with an application. He handed it to the mannager and when he went into the back to put it in the office with the others Doe pulled me aside and asked me to put in a good work for him. When my Mannager came back after Doe left I then pulled him aside and told him that if he hired Doe I would have to quit, end of story. He seemed perplexed as to why I would say this but must have made a mental note because on open interview day he and the assistant mannager asked to speak with me in the office. They closed the door behind us when we entered. Never a good sign. He then asked me if I knew Doe and I said “Yes, from ROTC. He was a cadet,”. He then asked why I felt so strongly about resining if he was hired and I explained, in my overly nice, I want to see the best in people way, that there was “mild sexual harrasment” when he was a cadet. My mannager said that, that immediatly disqualified him from even being consitered and the went out to do Doe’s interview as a formality. I guess the lesson is don’t sexually harrase women in a military leadership program. They will get you fired and prevent you from getting jobs. "
"I work for a very large international software company based in the US. I was out sick for a couple of days and upon returning to work, I was made aware that one of my assigned national accounts was re-assigned to a male co-worker. When I asked my supervisor why my account had been reassigned, she said, “It was reassigned because management felt the client would prefer to work with a man”. "
A sales rep from a subcontractor of my company asked me if I would have sex with him if he paid me. It didn’t surprise me since when I talked with him on the phone he would bad-mouth his wife to me. He told me one time that he’d asked her if she was going to train their daughter to trick a guy into marrying her and then withhold sex from him just like mommy. 
"At my workplace, some fun awards were suggested – one being for the woman most difficult to work with when having women’s troubles. It was pointed out this was sexist so all awards were cancelled ” in case anyone else got offended by what was intended to be lighthearted fun”. "
"At work we produced a book about the company that went out to all employees. Some people were looking at it, so I asked what they thought of it. In front of a room of 15 people, a man said, ‘I’m surprised not to see you in – I thought you’d be on page 3.’ The whole room laughed, including the two women there. When I spoke to HR they said they wouldn’t do anything because he didn’t use any bad language and ‘page three’ was an ambiguous term and could mean, you know, that he was just being complimentary about how I looked or something. As an aside, everyone in the company recently received dignity in the workplace training… "

"I also work in a male dominated workplace. I joined this place specifically because my supervisor would be a senior who used to regard me as a sister for so many years I knew him. Once I joined, the story was something else. My so-called brotherly boss, used to stare at my breasts whenever I spoke with him. I gave him leeway thinking most men cant help it so may be its just the straying eye. But then he started hinting about my weight and as I said I am happy with my body, he started pinching various areas of my flabby body to show me, asking me every time if this is thin, is this thin? I was shocked but I dint mutter anything because I thought may be it his way of showing brotherly concern. Apparently it was not. Everyday for the next few days, he was touching me all over and coming too close to talk to me and pinching my face. And one day again, asking about my weight, when no one was around, he said he wanted to carry me to see for himself how heavy I am. I was flabbergasted, also because only a few days ago, an uncle, in the pretense of helping me out with my job applications, had tried to pull me towards him and kiss me when no one was around. I started to wonder if I was giving off a certain kind of scent that was attracting these animals. It was too much. One evening, after work, when the ‘brotherly’ boss told me to stay after work and it was dark because the lights went out for some reason, I literally thought, this is it- I will be raped and no one will even believe me. He told me to lets get a coffee and come back. I said ok, with a lot of relief but I didnt want to come back later and darker than it was already. We went to a near coffeehouse, and in order to protect myself from further harassment, I told him of the case of the uncle and how I was planning to register a police complaint against him. This successfully made his eyes go wide and face white. After that, he has stopped what he used to do. But now that I have seen his true nature, I can’t concentrate on the work nor want to and I desperately job-hunting to leave this place as soon as I can. "
"At 61 years old, I have been through and seen it all. From walking in the streets to almost being raped by a man whose children I always babysat for, etc. I have been harassed in all my jobs throughout my life. And not just me. All of my friends have been at one time or another. And at this age, it still goes on. I work in an office with 50 and 60 year old disgusting men that think nothing of talking about porn on the internet and blow up dolls. I was recently in the ER with my mother and this man comes up to me, while my mom was in the bed sleeping asking me if I wanted to go to the coffee shop and have a cup of coffee with him. His father was in ICU and was “waiting around”. When I declined, he hands me his business card and tells me to call him. I am not married and I don’t wear a “fake band” so I guess to them it’s an open invitation to attempt to get a date, no matter where you are. When I was 16, my parents had a BBQ for the neighbors. I went into my room and was sitting at my desk, looking in the mirror (as what all 16 year old’s do) when my door opened and it was one of my neighbor’s boyfriends. He was in his early to mid 20’s and just came back from Vietnam. He came in, sat on my bed and started asking me weird questions. I froze. I didn’t know what to do. I answered his questions with one word answers. He silently got up, left the room and closed the door. When I told my mother, she was more worried about “what would the neighbors think” than worrying that this lunatic might have touched me or worse. This was in 1971 where the word “abortion” was whispered. It’s still a man’s world. It sucks. We have a President that openly admitted grabbing women’s crotches. "
"I used to be a Sergeant in the Police Force and encountered pretty much non-stop sexism from day one. When I first worked shifts after training college the team assembled at midnight in the canteen every time we were on night duty….to watch the 5 free minutes of porn which was shown on Sky tv at that time. I had my bottom squeezed by my ‘community beat’ patrol partner who I was meant to patrol with, on foot, every day alone. When I did my 3 week driver training course I spent 8 hours a day in a patrol car with 3 other officers. Every time it was my turn to drive the Instructor would, without fail, make a comment like ‘Oooo – look at the way Liz handles the gear knob’ or ‘Gosh – what a firm grip she has on that knob’ etc etc. It was relentless – and you can imagine the ribbing I got if I grinded the gear or made a mistake. Not very helpful when doing ‘blue-light’ runs for the first time. I worked really hard and passed my Sergeant exams after only 2 years getting in the top 1% of marks across the entire country. I was promoted by my Inspector to an ‘acting Sergeant’ post at his new station. We had to attend a divisional meeting and on the way back to the station he stopped the car at a cafe and told me he really fancied me and that he never really spoke to his wife much any more…and why did I think he had helped me get promoted? Officers who did make complaints were deemed ‘dangerous’ and were not to be spoken to. ‘Don’t talk to her – she’ll make a complaint about you.’ They weren’t backed up at incidents and were not supported in their work. I had dreamed of being a Police Officer since I was 12 and had worked hard as a Special Constable for 2 years whilst doing a degree to make sure I got a place. I wasn’t going to throw it all away by complaining about a bit of sexism here and there – I had to ‘man up’ and ‘tough it out’ which is what I tried to do. I was appalled by the way Rape victims were spoken about. I had only been in the job 6 months when my crew mate showed around the evidence from a rape victim who had been left with very dirty underwear. The offending item was in a sealed forensic bag waiting to be booked into property – when he ran about the office waving the stained crotch, visible through the clear seams of the bag, in people’s faces. Oh how they all laughed. Unhappy with the Force I was with, I transferred to another. I was bullied from Day 1. This time it was not in a sexual way, but for being young and female (I was 23, a Sergeant and very good at my job.) I had Officers break into my locker, steal my private work notebooks, spread rumours about me, whisper and laugh behind my back. The Chief Inspector who ‘investigated’ the crimes (criminal damage, theft) basically did nothing. I resigned when I could take no more and assumed it was just the Police who treat woman like this. I did another degree in an entirely unrelated subject and took up a post as a designer in a small, family run business. Now older, wiser, married with children, I never expected to experience anything like it again. Alas, my Boss regularly asks me to ‘sit on my knee’ and once pinged my bra strap when I was in the office alone with him. I politely told him to ‘F*** Off’ which seems to have curbed the worst of it. A close relative has now experienced similar in her workplace environment and I suddenly realise how wrong I have been ‘playing along’ with this…thinking it was up to me to tough it out, not wanting to damage my career prospects. Until we, as women unite and stand up together in every work place, in every town, in every city in every country, men will continue to get away with it. "
"I was returning to my friends from the bathroom of a bar one night and walked past a table full of men, men as in men who are old enough to be my father because I was 19 at the time. One of the men reached out and slapped my arse, and it hurt and embarrassed me enough to make me stop, and turn around and ask who they thought they were. Not one person, not the bartenders, not another customer, not even one of my friends said anything about it and the men just laughed. Even when I sat back down, one of my friends said “well, it’s just you have a very nice arse, it’s all those hours you’ve spent in the gym paying off” I had no idea I had been attending the gym so I would hopefully, maybe have a man old enough to be my father slap my arse, I was under the illusion I was attending for my health. In the workplace I had never thought much of a senior colleague calling me “tinkerbell” until my new manager started and informed me it was completely inappropriate. Nor did I think much of my male colleagues staring at me as I climbed a ladder to get stock. Also a customer in the shop I work in coming up behind me and pressing himself into my back and then asking me could I help him. I declined to help and walk away, he then had the audacity to go to my manager and inform him I wouldn’t help him look for a product, fortunately my manager promptly barred him. Another night in a bar, I was leaning over to give the bar tender my order when a woman put her hand up my skirt and rubbed my inner thigh. I was so horrified I didn’t know what to do or say. A man has grabbed my breast as he walked past me before, and my then boyfriend wanted to say something but I wouldn’t let him because I felt we were “making a fuss” There is a SPOTTED page at my university where the students are encouraged to send in messages about good-looking, beautiful, or sometimes just humorous messages about what they have seen around the university. Most of the posts are from lads, writing what they would do if they could to particular girls on campus. Some people see this as a compliment. A compliment is someone saying you’re beautiful, or you’re funny, or you’re intelligent (which does still happen on this page, and makes me smile). It is not a compliment to say you would “bash her backdoors in” (which makes me feel ill) "
"I am a medstudent and two years ago I did an internship in an orthopaedic hospital. Needless to mention that on my ward there was only one female surgeon. As an intern you often participate in the operations to hold retractors and if you’re lucky and a guy do the closing sutures (me as a girl – no chance – when I was already working there for three weeks and the new guy came in who was a year behind me in medschool, of course they offered him to suture after three days). What really shocked me is how the surgeons speak of the patients on the table when they’re already anaesthetized. Particularly overweight women are harassed and get named ‘cow’ or ‘elephant’. Once there was a young woman on the operating table and the surgeons spent about 15 minutes debating wether her breasts were too big or not. The surgeons also made sexist jokes about their wives and other females in their life a lot during surgery, and then expected me to comment or laugh. I didn’t and thus got the reputation of being humorless. That didn’t bother me so much but I really hated that the scrub nurses (most of them are female) always laughed along with them. "
"On my lunch break from work I decided it was be good to get some fresh air and exercise so I went for a walk (on my own) to the local supermarket and back. This is about a 10-15 minute walk each way and within this short timeframe I was either shouted at, cat called or wolf whistled at 3 times by 3 different builders/men in vans. What makes them think this is acceptable? It has really put a downer on what would have been a nice lunch break stroll. When I came back to the office I said this to one of my colleagues and she said she had experienced similar on her occasional lunch time strolls. This makes me incredibly sad. "
"Someone I used to work with in local politics has just had a letter published in the local paper recruiting people to an anti-Trump rally and condemning Trump as a “misogynistic boor”. I e-mailed the letter writer reminding him of an embarrassing e-mail he sent me when my daughter was born referring to me as “gorgeous”. He replied that he knew that women can get post-natal depression worrying about their attractiveness when they have a baby and he was trying to boost by sense of attractiveness! He refused to believe me when I told him of a mutual political colleague who repeated with sniggers a third colleague’s comparison of two women colleagues’ breast size (they appeared to find the two women too petite for their taste). What interests me is that here is a right-on liberal man who clearly believes Trump’s accusers (women he presumably does not know) but he does not believe me, someone he worked with for five years!

"My supervisor at work gave me a hug one day at the end of a tough shift. I felt awkward, but it happened so fast I just went it and tried to put it behind me. The next day he came in saying I shouldn’t have hugged him because he had hung out with friends right after work and had to explain to them why he had an erection… I didn’t even know what to say. I didn’t even initiate the hug. He shouldn’t have mentioned an erection to me at work, even if it did happen. I know it doesn’t sound serious, but this is only one of many workplace sexual harassment instances I experienced with that guy as my supervisor. A year later I found out he was a registered sex offender in another state and they hadn’t caught it when they hired him, and that it’d been found out and he was in jail. But even if he’s still in jail, or changed his behaviors now, it can’t erase my experiences and the fear and shame I still feel when I think about it. "
"I work in a small law firm without a proper HR Dept. The guy in charge of HR is an external contractor and he tends to revert to the Head of the Employment Law Team with any queries (they are fucking and everyone in the office is aware of this). Today we received new instructions regarding an employment case relating to a bakery. We became aware that the Respondent in that case had actually been convicted of raping the Claimant (for whom we will be acting). I sit next to the Employment team and overhead two members of that team and the contractor discussing the rape, which I inferred had been extremely violent and had involved other members of the Claimant’s workplace. Following this, a male member of the Employment Law team and the aforementioned “Head of HR” had a 10 minute discussion aloud on the office floor about how many different bakery-based sex puns they could think of and laughed hysterically at phrases such as “Make sure it rises”, “Look at this sausage roll” and “Get your baps out”. I am currently still on my probation in this role and have no other line manager I can speak to about this apart from the gentleman involved. This is the reality of many workplaces and I can only bear it because I am leaving in summer to live on a farm and never put up with this shit ever again. "
"Further to Tarry’s blog on this site (7 Feb 2017) about the sexist idiot of a Dutch (male) boss: that’s par for the course, BECAUSE THE NETHERLANDS IS THE MOST SEXIST COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE. The Netherlands is a country where they think it’s ok to sell women in windows in the middle of the city (pretty much emblematic of how they view and treat women). The Netherlands is a country in which only a teeny percent of women with school-age children work full time (apparently it’s 10%). The Netherlands is a country where women give birth AT HOME and with no emergency medical team on hand to save them if they or the baby is about the die. They have maternal mortality rates that are higher than many countries in the European Mediterranean — countries that the Dutch despise as being ‘backward’ (because the Dutch are also racist). Some respect the Dutch have for women; they just leave them to give birth at home and potentially die if there are complications. The Netherlands is a country in which there is HUGE pressure to give up your life to have kids and just be a ‘mummy’. The Netherlands is a country in which women don’t occupy the professions and, if they do, they don’t get to the top roles. I work in a professional environment in the Netherlands (I am an immigrant). I am one of a TINY number of women in my very senior role. All the women in these roles have either had to be ‘imported’ (highly-skilled immigrants like me, brought in to do the job), or, in two cases, are Dutch women but who were brought back from abroad where they had had the chance to develop professionally. My employer is trying to increase the number of women in senior roles because the Dutch government has imposed a quota on them to do so (25% of senior posts should be occupied by women — yeah, just a teeny-weeny 25%, and they can’t even fill that without bringing us from abroad because there are no Dutch women qualified to fill the posts). Even though I am a senior member of staff and I have a better CV and more qualifications than ANY of the Dutch men with whom I work, this is what happens to me at work in the Netherlands: *I am not allowed to perform my role; it is taken off me and given to a Dutch man to do (even though he is incompetent); *Decisions about staff in my team are taken by Dutch male colleagues and I am merely informed of the decision; I don’t get to participate in the decision making processes at all; *I am sidelined and excluded from many activities; *The boss, who is a big Dutch guy, shouts me down ALL THE TIME and won’t let me speak; *These big Dutch guys threaten me — they actually do THREATEN me — that if I don’t shut up they will try to get me the sack (on no grounds, it has to be added); *These Dutch guys go behind my back and make arrangements that affect me and my team and never inform me or let me participate in the discussions; *I was stalked by one of these big Dutch guys. I went to see HR to report it and the HR woman (also Dutch) just LAUGHED. My female colleagues earn less than males in the same role and with the same qualifications. My female colleagues are almost all on less than 100% contracts, while almost all of the males have 100% contracts (and most of the women WANT a full-time job, which would be the norm in my profession). Hiring processes are violently sexist: men are favoured over women candidates, and women have to prove much more to get in than do male applicants. Women are not given funding for e.g. professional training half as much as are male colleagues. The Netherlands is a violently sexist place. If you work there you will be subjected to everyday sexism EVERY SINGLE DAY: at work, in the street, and everywhere else… And the saddest thing of all? The only way to keep going as a woman is to simper to those big Dutch guys, tell them how marvellous they are, how great they are, and then they will do what you need them to do. They won’t let you do your job yourself, cos you’re a girlie and girlies are idiots, but they will do what you want. The Netherlands is living in the Dark Ages as far as gender equality goes… "

"I am a male. I am the eldest of three boys, raised by a single hard working mother following the suicide of my father. We have a great respect for women and are very pro-equality! However, I consider equality to mean equal, not greater than! There is one particular double standard in society for which I take exception. Termed ‘heightism’. It seems almost every woman I talk to holds a mans height as one of the most critical aspects for attraction. Women are actively reshaping the gender expectations of what society should find attractive, in women, however, I am yet to see anything similar for men. We are told that all women are beautiful, no matter what race, height or weight they are. Any public opinions to the contrary by men are condemned and considered mysodginistic and cruel. However, when it comes to the medias broad brush perpetuated statements about men’s height being the limiting factor to a males attractiveness, no one bats an eyelid. I am of average height 5’10, and have experienced ‘heightism’ to some extent, however have watched several great guys I know, who are shorter than average, really internally struggle with this for years. One, ended his life last year. I’m all for equality, but equality goes both ways. It’s not fair to change societies perception of what constitutes a beautiful woman, but then on the next page have a double standard for men! "
"My workplace has found it completely necessary to single out female employees travelling abroad. A document advising how to travel safely abroad for work has been sent out (which is fine and very helpful), however it features a dedicated section on female travelers. There is no comparative section for men. Why? Oh because women are morons that will accept drinks from strangers, purposely attract attention to the fact they’re travelling alone and flock to men displaying “MACHO” behavior. I wouldn’t be as pissed off if there also a section telling men not to, for example, sleep with prostitutes or get drunk on work time – but this section is nowhere to be found. Because men are sensible and ordered when travelling abroad. NO! This is so ridiculous that one of the biggest companies in the UK with international business completely discriminates women STILL! Very annoyed. "

I said “No I don’t, I’m only 16” to which he replied, “Well when you are ready to have them, give me a call” then winked at me. "
Not the first time I’ve posted on here… A co worker (20 years my senior) just told me he wouldn’t want to date me because “I’d be too much hard work with my beliefs”… 
"I’m a 34 year old professional woman with a great job, but unfortunately my new supervisor (an older man in his late 50s) has been making it uncomfortable at work with “off color” jokes and comments. When complementing me on a job well done, he once added “I’d marry you if it was legal in this state to have more than one wife” (he grew up Mormom and likes to joke about it). He also emailed me (and another female coworker) offering to get us a sexy bodycon “work” dress and a skimpy satin sleepwear “chemise” that looked like lingerie. Even though it made me uncomfortable, I tried to laugh it off the first time and said it would look better on him. The 2nd time, I said I wasn’t interested and not to send me those emails anymore. Last week I overheard his wife say I had a “resting bitch face” (she’s always dropping by the office, probably to check up on him). He tried to play it off as a joke and even sent me a Youtube video of women suffering from “resting bitch face”. I responded that it was not funny and he should try to be more sensitive. After months of letting it go and not speaking up, that was the last straw, so I told our manager about it. After their closed door meeting, he slammed the door and said something about having to take some “bullshit” sexual harassment training. Sadly, I’m the one dealing with the backlash of reporting it and still working with him. I’m worried about retaliation or losing my job (or just wanting to quit to not have to deal with him). On the one hand I’m proud of myself for finally saying something, but also worried about the backlash. This is not the 1950s, and too many women have dealt with harassment and fought against it, so I felt I needed to do my part and speak up. I don’t want to quit, nor should I have to, but it’s depressing that I now dread going to a job I used to love. It’s a sad fact that sexism and harassment are still so pervasive. "
"Talking with a female co-worker about a work project, a male co-worker walks by and covers his ears saying, “La la la, women talking, not listening…” Another male co-worker overhears this, says “I know, right?” and then proceeds to do a stupid chicken impression, clucking. When I type it out, it looks pretty silly, doesn’t it? Why do they think this is normal? "
"I work in government as an auditor. My most recent project was evaluating the streets department for our City. The project went fairly smoothly and we made a few recommendations for improvement. Months later, I ran into the director of the streets department who approached me by asking why I was at a certain event. And didn’t I “have somebody’s butt to crawl up?”. I didn’t laugh. I just walked away. I informed by boss who handled it pretty well. He brought my concerns to the head of HR. Long story short, the streets director was more of less told to apologize to me. How he did it though? By saying that he “should have left the jokes to the comedians”. I wish he wouldn’t have said anything at all. Because now he’s said that I can’t take a joke either. "
First day of work. FtM transgender but some still refer to me as female. Only 6 months into transitioning. The training environment was a one-on-one orientation. The older man training me called me “lil miss” and “my fair lady”. He told me he was going to “put me in his racecar ” and “go get us a drink.” When i extended his hand for a shake he hugged me. I got fed up and told him to just focus on training me for the job. He would hold his head and mumble the lesson. He has been reported and his offenses taken seriously… 
"I just read aloud a statistic about the disgustingly high rate of feminicide in Latin American countries to my boss. His response was to call over my 2 male coworkers and showed the three of us a video called “Sex Olympics” where half-naked women vault themselves onto men. I’m not humorless, and the video was relatively mild, but what I find extremely disturbing is the link he made between me sharing that awful news and immediately thinking to show a video of naked women jumping on men. "
"I teach English to adults, and the book our school uses is quite sexist. In the chapter on jobs, there is a man pictured beside jobs like manager, architect, engineer, but a woman beside teacher, receptionist, nurse. It’s embarrassing and hurtful to see this as a female teacher. "
"When, in a 30+ team, the only members asked to do admin are the three females. "
"I had very long hair and decided to get it cut short to a pixie cut. When I went into work a male member of staff patted me on the top of the head and said “oh you look so cute!” in the sort of voice you would use to a 4 year old. Everybody laughed and it really knocked my confidence, even though I knew I looked better with short hair. "
I had 2 colleagues one 60 something & the other 40 something curse me out in front of my 8yo daughter b/c they learned I hadn’t voted for the Dem presidential candidate. It was appalling & depressing. The worst part is that both are women. I once had a female colleague tell me that she knew I’d be hired when she saw me in the office to interview b/c “Ken” likes pretty girls. 
"Just got back from work, during which I helped a customer, and a random man who had nothing to do with it saw and then came up to me saying it was “very nice of me.” I ignored him so he repeated it in a different inflection to try to get my attention. Fortunately he gave up after that. No, moron, I wasn’t just being nice, I wasn’t doing that customer a favor, I WAS DOING MY JOB. Do you compliment working men on how “nice” they are too? Unfortunately I know from experience that if I’d said I was doing my job, or acted upset in any way, he would have just laughed and said, “I know, I’m just messing with you.” Fuck men who do this – and not in the way they want!!! "
"As a female architect, when I was more junior, I got used to putting up with some sexist ‘banter’ on building sites and I would normally give back better ;-). However, one particular site manager of a multi-million pound scheme that I was the architect for, decided to start referring to me as ‘princess’. It was excruciating, and most of the other guys on site were embarrassed by this. One morning, I turned up for a site inspection and the site manager was about to conduct a meeting with all his subcontractors- around 15 managers of the various trades. I wouldn’t normally attend such meetings but as I was there, I asked if it might be helpful for me to join the meeting and answer any design queries directly. The site manager just looked me up and down in a pervy way and said ‘Mmm yes, it’ll give us something to look at’. Urghhh- I complained to his boss and he got reprimanded. Funnily enough, I did end up going into the meeting and he was extremely respectful of my expertise in front of everyone… "
"joined a new workplace a month ago, one guy kept dropping hints that he was attracted to me, I gave him clear signals that I wasn’t. He persisted, watched me work from a distance and stood outside my locker. One day he asked for my number and I declined. The staring continued and I asked around about him. Turns out, he does the same to all Bengali looking females. Reported it and haven’t seen him since. I thought I was being wrong and felt guilty, but this website gives me the confidence to speak out. "
"When I worked for Garda Security Company in Calgary, Canada I was entering the elevator after work and a male colleague entered too. We exchanged pleasantries and he then told me that on his day off he would be “choking the chicken” and he made a mastubatory miming gesture. When I complained direct to him about this in front of another colleague he was in tears and he said the other females working for Garda had been ok with it. Within days I was removed from the site.For days I had odd comments from one of the other (gross) guys. When I said ‘See you tomorrow’ I got the reply ‘No you won’t’. So it seems everyone knew that I would be removed before I knew. I went to work (with Garda still) at the Greyhound Station in Calgary. My trainer/supervisor spoke in a sexually inappropriate way. So I resigned from Garda because the office admin could not understand that I just wanted to stay at my original site. They would have preferred to move me to a simple corporate position rather than sort out the problem or support my right not to be harassed at work. As a result of having to leave to avoid verbal sexual harassment I lost money and had to move to another town and another job in security for a different company with a better human rights record. "
After 2+ years on the job three women on my team have been denied promotions including me. Each of us responsible for 1m+ of new business more then any other team member. Promotions were requested and followed up on beginning with year anniversaries. Men promoted with 1.5 years or less during that time at the media agency. 
"While at a painfully quiet business dinner with vendors, my new, and old boss, I made efforts to engage conversation and bring a little levity to the table. On of the topic of our dogs’ quirky habits, I laughed about my dog’s penchant to snort as he staked out every corner of the house when he smelled an animal on the porch. Feeling good that there was finally a little laughter, you can imagine my devastation when new boss used the topic to remind me that dogs are just like their owners and ergo, mine must talk a lot because he wants it known to everyone that he is doing his job. Then he (new boss) ended the statement with an emphatic, “um-hmm” to validate his sentiment. Old boss, who I supported for 12 years and never once felt diminished by (rather the contrary, always valued), followed-up new boss with his own version “um-hmm.” In that moment, it was clear to me that new boss wanted to put me in my place. I was made aware that he has marked the perimeter of his territory and that I had no business stepping out of bounds and letting everyone know I am doing my job. Clearly, my place is under his direction and anything I bring to the table will not raise me up in this company, just him. "
I can’t even write on this site about how I was harassed then raped by my boss. 
"When I was 16, I started my first job ever. Part-time at a pizza shop. I was the only female working there for a long time, and for the first year or so everything was great, all of the guys that worked with me were nice, regular human beings. Then they hired a guy to start training as a manager, and I got my first taste of workplace harassment. It was nothing major, and never actually happened at the shop, but this guy, “J”, who was 25 at the time, took my cellphone number off of the weekly schedule (I have no idea who thought putting employee phone numbers on a schedule was a good idea), and sent me a text one night. At first it was innocent, just a “Hey how are you”, and even though I thought it was weird that he had my number, I went along with it. Then he started to ask me if I liked to drink, and inviting me to come and drink with him and his friends, and started to tell me how hot he thought I was and that he really wanted to date me. So at this point I showed these to my mother, who marched down to my workplace and demanded to speak to my general manager and his boss. After giving them a piece of her mind for about an hour, they assured her that “J” would be terminated immediately. As a kid, this whole situation kind of freaked me out, and I’m glad that all I had to put up with was a few inappropriate texts, but thinking back on it now, what really pisses me off about it was that my boss’s boss, the area manager, told me afterwards that the reason “J” was terminated was not because of the content of the text messages, but because he was “breaking company policy by fraternizing with employees outside of work”, and essentially brushing off my claim of sexual harassment entirely. Are you kidding me? "
"I will just list some of the more memorable ones: RAPE/SEXUAL ASSAULT 1. Being raped (first time) Being raped at age 19 by friend’s older brother after he got me drunk and passed out he took me to bed in their parents room. Woke up in middle of the night to him raping me. He then dragged me to every room in their house to do it again and again. Had to sit and eat breakfast with the family the next morning like nothing had happened and drive myself home before breaking down. Boyfriend at the time blamed me for being raped, said that I should have said no and it wouldn’t have happened. Boyfriend didn’t want me to tell anyone I was raped because “no one wants to hear that kind of thing”, and “its just negative” Sister of guy who raped me tells me that I “was up for it” because I had smoked a cigarette with him earlier that day and was flirting and laughing. 2. Guy in the street grabs my arse when I am walking to the supermarket. Turn around and scream at him but he just follows closer. I had to run into a supermarket to be surrounded by people to get away from him. 3. Being raped a second time. I had just had a surgery and my friend took me away to rest at a beach resort island. Ended up being raped by a random backpacker guy on the beach. He had been following us and then I insisted that I didn’t want to go to the beach with him but with friends ended up there. Friends all disappeared thinking it was romantic and that I would want to have sex with that stranger. I wanted to leave and would drink alcohol. He pushed me down and pulled my hair. I couldn’t resist because of the pain from my surgery still being sensitive and not healed yet. I can’t even understand how I ended up being raped on what was supposed to be a holiday to rest and recover from a very stressful surgery. Honestly, was in shock for a long time. 4. Being in hospital after a different surgery I asked the nurse to come because I felt blood coming out of my vagina between my legs. I didn’t understand why that would happen. Later told that the doctor had had to stick a metal object up my vagina to move my cervix around so he could look at stuff inside my abdomen. I hadn’t been informed that that would be part of the surgery. Anyway, the nurse that came was male and when I told him I thought I was bleeding he said he would go and get a female nurse to check it. I didn’t understand why he couldn’t just look and see if there was blood, I mean he was a nurse after all. He finally came back half an hour later and said there was no other female nurse available and so he just left it. I would have to wait til the morning (he was the night shift). Then when I finally was able to move the next day the nurses saw all the blood all over the bed. The male nurse hadn’t believed me and didn’t check. I was scared to be bleeding like that and just be ignored. 5. Having a boyfriend push me up against a tree in the street and try to choke me because I wanted to break up with him. 6. Having a boyfriend constantly pressure me to have sex even though I didn’t want to because it reminded me of being raped. 7. Missing days and days of work because I had depression from being raped and on top of that being harassed by boyfriends about it. As a result being held back from getting promoted because I missed out on all the good projects and leadership opportunities, not to mention a huge loss of self confidence. WORKPLACE HARASSMENT/UNFAIRNESS 1. Having rumours spread around the office that I had slept with a male colleague because we had shared a cab ride home (we lived in the same suburb). 2. Being told in a performance review that I wasn’t presenting a professional business presentation of myself in the workplace. When I asked for that to be clarified – it seemed vague and I didn’t know what I had done wrong exactly – I was told that I had yawned in a meeting and didn’t look good for me. Yet blokes sit with their legs stretched out wide, shirts undone drinking beer in the office and its totally fine. I can’t even yawn. When I complained about the unfair comment in the performance review the HR manager recommended that I always take a bottle of cold water to meetings because that can help with paying attention!! 3. Being hired to start a new job at the same time as this other guy and sitting next to him all day in the office overhearing him talking to his friends on the phone, skypeing with his financial adviser and running a small business on the side – while not doing any work. His reports are shocking and he can’t write or do research. Meanwhile I am slogging my guts out beside him with earplugs in to block out his calls day after day trying to work. The quality and standard of my work far surpassing his. Then after 9-12 months with no announcement or formal process he suddenly gets a new job title and promotion. I had to keep working away for another 4 years at that job and then make a formal application and interview to get the same title and promotion. When I finally got the promotion he was long gone and already became CEO or something of his own consultancy. I watch his presentations and he is full of shit! There is no quality or substance to his work. I still don’t understand how these men get away with it. No substance but they can talk themselves up so much and because they are rich white males they get everything handed to them. 4. Applying for a graduate position out of uni, competing with 8000 applicants for 15 positions. Of the successful group, only 4 are women. Being one of the ‘chosen’ women I am dumbfounded to find out that some of the other successful male engineers had already negotiated their salary rise before they had even started working there. I was astounded that they had the confidence to negotiate for a salary increase when they had no work experience and had just finished university, and they got it given to them. "
Being told by a senior manager to buy myself some chocolate with the credit card I was borrowing off him (in order to pay a fine associated with one of our vehicles). He felt necessary to follow up with the fact that he doesn’t like chocolates with “soft centers”. 
I am a doctor. I asked a patient if I could listen to his chest with my stethoscope to diagnose pneumonia. He said only if he could feel my chest first. His son then told me how he’s always been “a lady’s man”. 
"As a younger woman from a ethnic minority background who is currently serving and has served on a variety of influential panels and boards, I find I face more sexism from other women than men. Men with less knowledge, experience, degrees, etc. than me are accorded more respect by some women. When they express disagreement or inform the group about something, the women listen and rarely challenge them. When I do it, as politely as possible but assertively, I am deemed to be condescending or disagreeable even as other people (men and women) appreciate my input or perspectives. I am expected to be make decisions based on emotion, apologize for actions that are merely disagreeing on an idea, and preface my words with compliments or validation. I try to not sterotype other women but throughout my professional career, it’s usually been the men who have been supportive. Some women tend to take everything personally. It’s as if some women are so insecure or jealous they cannot stand someone who might be younger, more energetic, dynamic, smarter, more attractive, etc. than they are. "
"My boss sent an email to my peers, majority women, with a few men. The email was to demonstrate a process I used to get work done and she gave me kudos for coming up with it. Minutes later, while I was at the copy machine, my male peer mocked me for being smart. He called me a teachers pet and little miss perfect. He was loud and said it in a singing mocking manner that all of our coworkers could hear in the cubbloce farm we work in. I want to believe it was just a peer throwing a friendly jab, but he has made comments like this before when he was my direct boss and often dismissed my ideas in meetings while he mentioned he wants more male energy in the office. "
"I work at a Wendy’s and have a very irregular, and heavy, period. One day my male boss asked us if we had any suggestions to make the workplace better and I asked if they could keep some feminine products in the office in case one of the 65% female staff needs something during her shift. My boss awkwardly laughed and said no. "
"Firstly can I just say what a wonderful platform this is, after just watching the creator of this sites TED talks discussion it has inspired me to mention a few of my experiences. From a stranger trying to rape me during my university days because I was drunk and had lost my friends group, to regular bouts of verbal harassment in the street whilst out running, being rated out of 10 whilst walking in the streets by young men, being told to wear heels to work and in my current job in a male dominated construction environment men telling me ” women shouldn’t be allowed to work in a men’s world” and that if I have children I will not be able to keep my management job as I need to be able to work long hours. I feel that as women we are expected to prove ourselves to be capable of a typically male role whereas men are not tested but assumed as part of the ‘clique’. I believe that one day we will live in a society where sexism is seen as being as atrocious as slavery was, and hope that other women can find the strength to be strong in these testing times. "
"I am at an impasse â€“ I have been molded- reformed- to accept conduct and behavior that is unprofessional and demeaning within my current career. At one time I rejected this- the commentary and crude remarks posed as humor, banter- and for that I was chastised and labeled- a prude, a bitch, and a trouble maker. And yet even within my conformity to this patriarchal hierarchy that insists upon sexualizing every individual within its structure I am also told as a woman that I must be courteous loyal supportive and dis-passionate. So even as I witness that men around me in leadership roles perform their duties and conduct their behavior in a juvenile fashion I am still held to a higher standard within my also reformed and acceptable position. I feel there is no winning in the culture in which I reside. If I respect myself and stand for what I believe, follow and revel in my passion- both positive and negative because without passion there is no drive to agree or disagree- than I am a Nazi feminist who needs â€œto get fucked more oftenâ€? â€“ Or I convert, conform, fall in line and accept my place as a woman and a subordinate. I am disheartenedâ€¦. "
"I had to block my ex, his gf and his siblings on social media because they were using it to spy on me and to keep tabs on my current location. I know they were doing this because I would get text messages from my ex asking questions that were very specific to where I would be at the time or what I would be doing. This was VERY creepy as you can imagine, so I blocked them all, just to be safe. What was far creepier though, was that people didn’t care. No one was outraged on my behalf. Friends/family/acquaintances asked if I blocked him and would lose interest in the topic completely when I confirmed that I did, as if his was acceptable behaviour in the first place. Why is that the case? Why is it that a man can stalk his ex on social media and use the information he collects to harass her, and no one bats an eye? Why do we live in a world where a man is 100% comfortable with people knowing he’s a stalker because he won’t face a single negative consequence for his stalking??? Things need to fucking change. "
"In PSHE the emphasis was more on “my self esteem” and “my feelings” than on “esteeming other people” or “other people’s feelings”. It seems that young people are encouraged to think about themselves and not so much about how their behaviour will affect other people. These days young people are not taught so much about consequences of their behaviour. Also, certain behaviours that can hurt others at school such as swearing in public or forcefully touching someone without his/her consent aren’t punished. Lots of these behaviours are just ignored by teachers. This is why many people my age or younger may swear at school/work, use explicit language in front of children or harass someone in a sexual way. We were never explicitly told at school what a harmful effect our behaviour can have on others. People tend to think that their behaviour is okay if they aren’t corrected on it. Someone might think that swearing or touching someone else is okay because that person was never trained to think that this behaviour could hurt or upset someone else. PSHE was always selfishly focussed on “my future”, “my achievements”, “my goals”, me, me, me… If someone is sexually harassing someone else, harasser is not thinking about the other person involved, just what the harasser can get out of the situation. It is a form of selfish greed that doesn’t take into account the feelings of the other person. With self help success talks on “achieve your dreams by being selfish” or “get any woman to sleep with you” is it really any wonder that there is so much harassment and stepping on other people’s feelings in the world? True story, when I was depressed, a female mental health worker said that I could make myself feel happier by being selfish. I said: “Thanks, but no thanks”. She was horrified at my response because she said that it was “good to be selfish”. She used to come up behind depressed men and give them shoulder massages without asking them first. She also used to barge into my personal space, touch me suddenly or sit herself down next to me without saying hello or even asking: “Is it alright if I sit down here please?” So it isn’t just younger people, it’s older people that barge about also. Some young people are well behaved, but we are told to make “make choices”, not so much to “accept consequences of our own behaviour”. I never ever hear the phrase “well it serves you right for being unkind to so and so” any more. We are not taught to think about other people’s feelings or boundaries any more, we are just told to obsess about our own “self esteem”. "
"I worked at large call center. The CEO used to walk the floor randomly. Out of hundreds, he’d always stop at my desk and compliment my clothes, looks and say things like “you’re my little super star”. Maybe I’d could brush that off as harmless but it was known he’d hang out with younger girls there outside of work, pay some of their bills, and other skeevy things so the whole thing made me uncomfortable. I told some friends, they apparently told higher ups who came to talk to me so I had to go to HR to make an official report, not fun. After that meeting, the CEO, on more than one occasion, still came by my desk and said like “I guess there is someone in this office who doesn’t like being complimented”. One of the other higher ups told this dude exact words from my HR meeting. Awesome. He eventually left the company on his own, probably working somewhere else, doing the same thing. "
"Apparently it’s OK for men to be pushy in the workplace, but not women, who are usually described as ‘ball-breakers/busters’, ‘bitches’ or ‘overambitious’ if they display this behaviour. And some men seem to have a MAJOR problem with taking orders from female bosses/superiors, & accuse them of emasculating their male colleagues, especially if the women have stronger personalities than their male counterparts.

"Knelt on the floor restocking shelves in the shop I work in when a man comes up behind me and says ‘thats what I like to see, a woman on her knees’. Not the first time it’s happened either. "
"2013: I was working at as a secretary, a man who didn’t work for the office directly (independent contractor) groped my bottom. At first I couldn’t believe what had happened. I stood there, with my hands stretched out, turned out slightly, frozen for a good two minutes while he stood across from me. Another woman was in the room, distracted, busy. She didn’t notice. I stood frozen thinking that it had to be a mistake. Surely, there isn’t such disgust, such disrespect for human life in a world where Judith Butler and Rice exist. Surely. Everyday, workplace sexism. – The next time a man violated me this way at work â€“ rubbing the small of my back, I told him that I did not like to be touched and to remove his hand immediately. A few days afterwards he apologized profusely. Stand up, don’t be afraid to say something. You have the courage. "
"I’m still sort of young, so luckily I haven’t been exposed to some of the more horrible workplace sexism. However, there are many reoccurring instances that gradually become an irritating background noise. Being a regular internet addict, I was witness to many a positive november tumblr and facebook post wondering whether women could also participate in no-shave november getting completely shut down by ignorant jerks. A common theme was any girl that participated in no-shave november would also have to participate in “no d*ck december”. This is only the latest in a deeply ingrained belief that women should endure endless costly products, pain, and potential future bodily harm just to meet beauty standards. It is one thing to think of your body as a fresh canvas for you to express yourself. It is something else to dress for the purpose of conforming to society’s expectations or to try to prevent your body from performing a “shameful” act of nature and produce body hair and develop stretch marks. Another uncomfortable event happened whenever I saw a particular old man. The first time I met him I was swimming laps with my dad and he made some comment to my dad implying he thought I was some sort of hot young wife/girlfriend. I was fifteen, and my dad was fifty one. Every time after that he always seemed just a little too friendly. When I was sixteen he tried to pair me off with a 20-something year old pastor. My fourteen year old brother is going through a phase (hopefully) where he thinks that men are better at everything and are entitled to everything. The only place I can think of that would have reinforced this belief is the internet, because both of my parents are feminists, as am I. My mom makes more money than my dad and I have always been better than him at almost everything, so I’m not completely sure how he justifies this in his mind. It has gotten to the point of off and on verbal aggression against my mom, and unfortunately this doesn’t change when he gets yelled at. No one is sure how to address this because he is stubborn and denies everything when accused, but at the same time he never physically hurts her. I’m not sure what to do, but I feel a bit guilty that I look forward to leaving for college this fall. "
"My last professional freelance Technical Writing gig’s hiring manager (male) told me he hired me as I looked as if I’d be “easier to control” than the other candidate (male) shortlisted. It was a really bizarre statement, and annoyed me at the time as I felt I was being treated like a child. It took my husband to point out that it was just plain, ugly sexism. "
"I was sexually assaulted at my workplace, I told my boss, he withheld reporting procedure and intimidated me into putting a statement on file – dictated by him – which he said I could reopen if I wanted At a future date. But when I tried to do so due to continued harassment he again intimidated mee into doing nothing. I reported the assault and harassment to three different managers, by law they were obliged to investigate but they did nothing. Now I am off work, the assailant has got away scoot free and they are trying to say I am mad. They are mad for breaking the law. They should not get away with it. However I suspect they have on previous occasions, and that is why everyday sexism continues. We all have to make sure we stand up and are heard, however hard and however long it takes , we will get there Iin the end – the law is on our side, and when eventually they realise it those boys’ club smirks will at long last fade. We, and I, will prevail, they just don’t know it quite yet. "
"I attended a meeting for a newly developed facility as one of the designers. When he got to the table, the gentleman representing the board of directors asked me if I was the architect’s assistant. I replied, “No, I’m one of the designers on this project.” He said, “A designer’s assistant?” A few weeks later I had to call this same gentleman. I left him a voicemail with my contact number. When he called back, he scolded me that I had spoken too quickly when I recited my number, and said, “You need to learn to speak more slowly. It’s important, young lady.” I am 44 years old. "
There is a pervasive habit of calling women who work in the service industry “girls.” Hello girls! How are you young lady? These are comments that I receive daily. Its infantilizing and not at all amusing: I’m a forty year old woman. 
"I am a 40-something year old surgeon. I have dealt with elements of sexism daily for 11 years. I’m most infuriated when male surgeon colleagues look through me when I speak, interrupt me when I speak or just don’t hear me when I speak. I’ve been working at the same hospital now for 7 years and even today, the male surgeons’ eyes drifted away from me as I started speaking. It’s discouraging, demoralizing, and enraging even this far into my career. We wonder why women have so much repressed rage? "
"So I worked for my dad at his automotive shop, and he wanted to sell tires from this specific company so I called them asking to open an account. We did enough business that it would be worth your while to sell to us. The guy who answered the phone was really skeptical, he’d heard of our store which looks small from the outside. He thought we should just buy from the tire stores nearby, paying regular price, instead of wholesale from them. I told my dad, pretty dejected, what the guy said. He said fine whatever. A year goes by and we got a new employee who was telling my dad about these tires. And my dad decides he’s going to call them up and see if he can get an account. So he calls, and says he’d like to open an account. The guy on the other line says, “OK, let me get the paperwork started.” No resistance whatsoever. I was astonished, and humiliated! Here my dad didn’t get the tires he wanted at wholesale price because of me, for an entire year! You might think it was a different guy and a different day. But I think all the women know the guy gave me the run around because I’m a woman, and my phone voice is girly, which connotes that I’m dumb or not to be taken seriously. What this taught me was that you have to challenge the men who tell you no. Sometimes that no is really a yes (ironic no?) but it’s like a way to weed out women entirely-unless she’s a really insistent women and it becomes more difficult to weed her out than to just give her what she wants. Don’t be afraid to challenge their “no!” "

"At my boyfriends old job I used to visit him on his breaks, and he had a chef that worked there who was easily 30 years older than me (I was 15 at the time) and when I used to sit with my boyfriend I could hear him talking to other co-workers saying sexual things that he’d love to do to me. It made me feel so uncomfortable. "
"Our chief operating officer earns nearly 5 times my salary but, despite having all the power and authority, he decided to make me stand outside his office for 15 mins for our first ever meeting (which was only scheduled to last 20 mins anyway) while he gossiped with another senior male colleague. I know it was gossiping because the walls to his office aren’t as thick as he thinks they are. It was totally a power move. He also does not reply to my emails but instead emails his response to my male line manager. There’s nothing like an insecure 50 year old man behaving like a toddler to ease the work day. "
"My boss tried to humiliate me on my first day of work. I’m from Ireland living in The Netherlands. On my first day, he was asking me what brought me to The Netherlands and I told him, and ended my explanation with “… so we decided moving to Europe would be good for us!”. Now allow me to clarify. I’m not an idiot. I and all Irish people are WELL aware that Ireland is and always has been a European country. When I said that we decided to move to Europe, I wasn’t implying that we didn’t already live in Europe. I took it for granted that he would know that I meant “mainland Europe”. It’s common place for Irish people to refer to mainland Europe as just “Europe”, because we’re an island nation and, physically, unconnected to the rest of the continent. Anyway, my boss looks at me like I’m the stupidest woman he’s ever seen. He starts laughing really condescendingly and says things like “oh, cos Ireland’s not in Europe?” and “So you’re not European already?”. Even though, to be perfectly honest, I got the immediate impression that he knew well what I had meant and he was deliberately being pedantic in order to make me seem like an idiot, I attempted to clarify my statement by explaining as I have in the above paragraph. As I tried to explain, he immediately raised his voice to drown mine out, as he proceeded to very loudly tell my other new bosses and co-workers “Did you hear what she just said? She thinks Ireland isn’t in Europe!!!”. He then laughed louder than ever as I, in vain, tried to explain that I didn’t think that and that’s not what I meant. Everyone around looked embarrassed for me and I ducked into the kitchen until he had stopped loudly cackling and mocking me and work began. Yes, this was as the same work place where I was routinely harassed, both sexually and otherwise. And no, none of my male co-workers were EVER subjected to the same or similar treatment. They were treated with respect. "
"My husband told me that his workplace (the NHS) are interviewing for a new software developer he overheard his bosses discussing who they should hire after the interviews. They were saying that the best candidate was a woman who had just interviewed, but that they would not hire her because she was in her late twenties and would probably want to have a family (apparently they didn’t actually ask her). A man got the job. My own father also told me that he would not hire a woman between the ages of 20 and 40 because he couldn’t afford to pay her maternity. I am 28 and I don’t even want kids. How is this fair? "
"Second day on the job in a jewelry store. Was serving a German woman with a broken watch and asked my manager (male) for help. Customer said, “ah, yes, the men often know more about these things”.

Working in a small computer shop with a total of 5 staff. 4 men and me. I only worked a saturday. Every single week someone (almost always a man) would ask a question and I would provide the answer. The customer would then stand at the counter looking behind me at the technicians for them to answer the question. The guys I works with were fab and every single time they would say she just told you. Most of the time the customer hadn’t listened to what I said because I’m a girl so they would have to ask me to repeat myself or leave with out the answer. Some would try to ask around the question to get the answer repeated. 
"I was out at Christmas in small farming town. Some outsiders were in the bar we were in, one particularly revolting and drunk creature was ranting and raving to a group of his Neanderthal, herd like friends. Out of nowhere, their little huddle parted bringing me into the direct line of sight of the ringleader. As the atmosphere closed in around me, the group went silent just as the moron screamed at the top of his lungs ‘OI! YOU! TITS!’ Whilst punctuating each word with a jab of his finger. He then proceeded to drop his phone, pour Desperado beer all over it before jumping up and down on it. Is it not time we as a society accepted that men like this need a separate place to play, like the zoo? "
"I used to work at this pizza place. Almost as soon as I started working there all 3 of the full-time guys started hitting on me. One was married and old enough to be my dad, but came on to me anyway – not aggressively or in a way that I found intimidating, but still. He kept asking me why I wasn’t in a relationship and my reaction is still…whhhhyyy? Do I HAVE to be in one? Of course because as a young woman that should be the only thing on my mind and the only goal I have to fulfill right? Practice flirting, dating, then have a longer term relationship that might end in marriage and babies? Oh yeah, of course [sarcasm]. However, I couldn’t say that to him. All I could say was ‘I’m not looking to be in a relationship right now’, but that didn’t stop the following… The other guy wanted to go out with me but never said a word to me – never even made an effort to get to know me, or talk to me. The older guy and the third guy both kept trying to bully me into going out with him – obviously because they just wanted their friend to get some, or whatever. Never mind about the fact I’m not interested, and never mind about actually getting to know a girl, and maybe asking her out if you’re interested in her sincerely, or is that me being too old-fashioned? The third guy kept coming on to me in this really creepy, borderline aggressive way and when I made it clear that I didn’t want casual sex with him, he started to insult me viciously both in private and in front of other members of staff, at one point saying that I was ugly [suddenly I’m ugly to him, even though 5 seconds ago he wanted to have sex with me]. I was at a festival once, and had previously met a distant friend of a friend of a friends. We had had a very brief conversation a few nights before, but we had no vibe, no chemistry, nothing was going on…at least not to me. I started to sense though that he wanted me, even though I wasn’t flirting or doing anything explicitly inviting of anything, all I was doing was simply talking and being myself, nothing especially! A day or so after we had this brief talk, I was walking through the festival and passed where he was staying. He came up to me to talk to me, but just grabbed me and kissed me on the mouth. He didn’t get past my lips, but still. I was stunned in that moment and didn’t know how to react so I just left thinking what the fuck? Thank fuck that wasn’t a proper kiss because if he had got in my mouth I would be feeling gross right now…I feel gross anyway. I feel angry. What the fuck? I don’t know this guy, I haven’t given him an impression, I’m not flirting or behaving like I want to explore anything with him, what made him think he could just GRAB me and kiss me? In the moment when he forced this lip-press on me, I realize now that I – like many other women – didn’t punch him in the stomach and snarl ‘get the fuck off me you creep!’ because I suffer from the over-politeness syndrome in which it doesn’t feel right to decline because you don’t want to hurt someones feelings…this is so fucking twisted and wrong. We were in a public place surrounded by people so it would have been awkward to punch him, but you see…its awkward for a girl to defend herself from unwanted groping, but the unwanted groping is considered normal in comparison. twisted. Once I was working for this big event as part of a team. Me and this boy were being shown around by a female manager and we came across all these crates that needed to be moved. Being an enthusiastic, practical and strong person I went straight ahead and started to move the crates but then the woman manager stopped me, saying something along the lines of ‘no, you’re not lifting those, you’ve got to have babies later in life, the boys can lift these’, as if to say that because my female body has the potential to bear another life, that makes it some kind of precious baby-machine that must be preserved and saved from being damaged, that or i’m somehow weak and incapable of lifting and hard work simple because of my gender?? This fucking infuriated me then, and it still does. It’s ridiculous because women are just as physically strong if not stronger than men. Women can be gymnasts, body-builders, wrestlers, rugby players, athletes, soldiers AND mothers – whats weak about women?? It makes me laugh whenever people suggest that women can’t do certain things because of their physique, but the same people will never mention all the little, skinny, timid men that exist. I’m so sick of this perception of women being physically brittle, weak, delicate creatures that must be spared and protected and preserved at all times and to this day we must be tiny, thin, soft little girls who look pretty and act pretty for men. It’s bullshit. There is so much misogyny in this world on a daily basis and sometimes its so normalized that its hard to notice, other times its so explicitly clear. "
My boss and a worker laugh between themselves because I was in a pose in which tehy could see my teets. I felt really bad because they didn’t tell me anything and just laugh at me and my body. 
"My workplace is largely dominated by women at junior levels and men at senior levels. Every time a situation occurs in which a group of women assembles with one man present whether it’s a coffee break or a meeting someone will describe it as a “harem”. For the record, I am not a concubine. "

"When I was 14, I started working at a flower shop as my first job, ringing people out at the counter. One of the other workers, who was 15 at the time, kept chatting me over snapchat, but I didn’t want to talk to him, so I wouldn’t respond usually. One of the last times he chatted me, after saying “hey” he asked why I never respond to him. I told him that I just don’t respond to people usually because I didn’t want to seem rude. Then he asked if he could tell me something, and I said sure. Then he said that it was sort of weird, but I told him that he could say it. then he said, “You have really nice tits.” and I didn’t respond. and he said “shit, I knew I shouldn’t have said anything”. I didn’t want to seem like a prude, and I had had other guys tell me the same thing before, so I didn’t want to make a big deal about it. I told him it wasn’t a big deal, and so he then asked me, “How big are they?” After that, I told him off and never talked with him again. That weekend, I went to my work with my mom, and we told my bosses (both women) what he had said to me. They offered to fire him, but I just didn’t even want to go back there, so I quit my job and haven’t been back since. "

"I can’t believe it. I just can’t. Anyway, at work (Here’s some background, I work in a library, I’ve been there for 2 years and a bit now, it’s more of a community centre, than a library as such) we run a film afternoon for the children on Saturdays. For 12-18 months, I’ve been putting the popcorn in cups to give to the children while they watch the film. This is no trouble as it’s easy for me to clean up later and because of issues relating to hygiene. It made sense back then. Now everything’s changed. This Saturday gone (28/1) I’ve been getting complaint after complaint saying that I need to start putting the popcorn in large bowls for people to scoop and ‘encourage sharing’. I was upset at this. I told them to listen to themselves and that this new idea is going to ‘encourage germs’ Secondly, can these people, just stop doing this? Can they just stop telling me how I should do my job here? I get it repeatedly, I’m constantly told how I need to do my job here by people who think they know everything. It’s microaggression. I’ve also had someone say I speak English well for ‘someone brown. I don’t know what it is these people want or expect. I spoke to my mum (a nurse) and she was ”They have no right to tell you how to do your job here! Is this what they think? That their opinion matters and they should be the centre of the universe? This is entitlement!” They also think I’m ‘confrontational’ when I’m assertive and it’s just my heritage! (I’m half Caribbean). Rant over. "
Workmate discovers a women’s group have a function at our workplace and makes a comment about ‘throwing them in his car’. I make a light joke seeking to point out how creepy the comment was: ‘women probably wouldn’t like that’ to which he responds ‘depends on how drunk they are’. Another workmates discovers we will be understaffed for a week. ‘ we’re gonna get RAPED’ he says. 
"Im 18 years old and work in a pub, ive had 3 major sexist advances made against me in the one and a half month ive worked there. An old man told me to wear red lipstick to work if i wanted my tips. Another man made me take his number, but because i wont go near him anymore and act cold around him in the pub due to this, he complains. A man also grabbed my hand from over the bar and refused to let me go, forcefully squeezed my wrist and asked if id marry him, he also made sexual gestures towards another woman who works with me. It is fucked up. I would rather look “ugly” and wear no makeup to work and NOT get tips, than face sexism and objectification just for an extra Â£5. "
"A female subordinate in my workplace went to show a new female member of staff around the unit.

One woman’s reply to the event was to state along the lines ” well you know what their like”. We discussed it afterwards, I was furious that it had happened but even more furious that another female colleague who knew before me and could have acted had not and her reaction supported the sexist and abusive behaviour.

But, then I have to fight to get credit for that work. I am expected to silently turn it over to technically incompetent male coworkers. The men on my team, on the other hand, are allowed to present their own work and get credit for what they do by default. Not just a mere annoyance, this inefficient workplace keeps health care costs sky high for everyone.

"I’m a female full professor at a research university in the United States. Two of my male colleagues routinely act as if they are above our process for determining the agendas for meetings, and hijack them at their pleasure. The process is that our support staff sends out a call for agenda items and then the department chair forms them into an agenda. Despite receiving the agenda in writing, these two choose to ignore it and introduce new items without obtaining the consent of their colleagues. When female faculty members whose items (buried at the bottom of the agenda) complain about the situation, the chair brushes them off and won’t use even the most diplomatic of strategies to make sure that everyone is treated fairly, even when the complaining professors outrank the chair. This strikes me as unconscious sexism. Unsurprisingly, the upper administration uses the same marginalizing scripts as the chair when confronted with various complaints from female faculty from across campus. And they wonder why they can’t remain women faculty! "

To make matters worse, my mum has done everything and more she was told by her boss that would “definitely get her the promotion”. When I studied sexism in the workplace at college, I didn’t get a good enough idea of it until now – it’s not just that women have to work harder than men for the same things and less pay, but even doing that isn’t guaranteed to help.

It would have shown real dedication to your career.” What was he trying to say? That I should work beyond my contracted hours just to show dedication? That since I don’t have children I don’t have anything worthwhile to do in my free time so I should work? That once I do have children I could be expected to not show dedication to my career?

"There are tons of stories I could tell, but this is the most recent. I work in an open space office with about 40 members of staff working in the same space. My team consists of two women, two men. Yesterday we were listening to a state owned radio stations programme for young people (called Virus). They were advertising an upcoming show (“Cypher” I believe) all day long. It’s a show where young rap artists can have an open mic session for a fee minutes. The female moderator used a line of a duo called ruff & limmit to do so. It goes like this: “Fick dini leggins will Rap isch maskulin” (“fuck your yoga pants ’cause rap is masculine”). That might be taken out of context and all, but still. So I was very much looking forward to this show. The men on the team on the other hand were really eager for it to start. It was worse than everything I’d expected. It was only young guys rapping and seriously, some of the lyrics went like this:” I wake up in the morning and I stumble over my huge thing” and other imbecile stuff. And literally every line ended with “bitch” or “motherfucker”, I couldn’t believe it! After several complaints and a bit of swearing from my side I decided to turn that show off. Then, my male coworkers complained about it! They complained that I took away their fun! In the end they went on listening to it on their earphones. Later they told me I should learn to see when something is just fun and not serious. I told them I think it’s a shame public radio airs stuff like this and that this is an open space office where it’s not okay to disturb coworkers with offensive radio shows. Still I feel sick to my stomach. "

It was so bad I tried my hardest to never be alone with him. Once he was able to corner me outside of the office and asked me if I wanted to go for a drive somewhere. When I said No he was surprised. He left me alone after that but always made a point of mentioning in public that he sometimes says controversial things to get people out of their comfort zone and be more assertive.

"Around 5 years ago a colleague asked me out on a date and I accepted. We had a nice night but I quickly realised that I wasn’t interested in him romantically. I had come out of a relationship around a year earlier and if I’m honest I was still in love with this other guy and not ready for a seriously relationship, which was what my date clearly wanted. I tried to communicate this to him after he had very kindly driven me home but he wouldn’t take no for an answer so I ended up agreeing to trying things out with him, although I explained that we would have to take things emotionally and physically slowly. We then end up kissing in the front seat of his car and he proceeds to place his hand under my dress and insert his finger into my vagina. I had literally just told him that I wanted to take things slowly and he proceeds to touch me sexually! I stopped kissing him and told him that this was “too soon” and he removes his hand and we start kissing again and literally 30 seconds later he proceeds to do the same thing again. I didn’t say anything to him and I just thought you had your chance, I asked you not to and you’ve gone and done it again so I know now that I don’t want anything more to do with you. The next day he sent me a load of text messages and offered to drive me home from work. I told him not to because I was perfectly happy to get public transport plus he wasn’t working that day and we lived in completely opposite parts of the city but he still wouldn’t take no for an answer. I had a text message when I got out of work telling me he was waiting for me so I got into the car and ended things as he drove off and asked him to drop me off so that I could get home by public transport. He said no, that he would drop me home and that it was ok, he just wasn’t my type and then told me that he had had a terrible day because his mum tried to commit suicide and then got angrier and more upset as the half hour journey went on, eventually telling me that he was a “nice guy” who deserved a chance and would I like him any more if he was a bastard? Why is it that men who perceive themselves to be “nice guys” feel that they are more deserving of female attention simply for behaving in a normal way? Simply for not being a “bastard”. Why can’t they just accept that a girl is not interested instead of thinking that we owe them a chance simply because they are “nice”. It took me a while to realise that I was sexually assaulted, I think I even laughed about it with my friends the next day. It took me a long time to realise that I was actually violated, I actually felt bad for ending things with him. It shows just how deep-routed sexism is in this world that I actually felt bad for ending things with a man who had sexually assaulted me the day before. "

"I’ve experienced so many incidents, I can’t even count them. Whenever I’d dress up, I’d feel like I lost the right to own my body. I would hear the worst sexual comments, but I would fight back. Yelling, discussing, arguing. The responses mainly were even more insulting. One of the more “sophisticated” arguments being: “if you don’t want someone to steal your car, don’t leave the window open.”…so, does that mean, by dressing provocatively I’d become an object or was I already an object to begin with? Just as exhausting and shocking as some men’s behaviour, was the reaction of most of the women I told about those incidents…recommendations would range from the advice to dress differently to the remark that I could simply avoid certain areas….yes, why don’t I stay home altogether. The cheer blindness of even the victims for the bigger issue that lies behind this problem, stunned me and made me feel even more desperate…because, how can things change in the face of such ignorance??? Getting older, I’m getting so tired of it all…fighting back feels exhausting and pointless. I actually started giving in by wearing different clothes and avoiding specific areas and this makes me feel like I’ve given up, like I’ve compromised myself, but I don’t know what to do anymore…I’m waiting to reach my 40’s and simply vanish into invisibility, like it seems to be almost every women’s fate these days…harassment or invisibility-it’s our pick. Aren’t we lucky? "
My story begins at eight years old when I was and witnessed my five year old sister be sexually abused by my older brother – ” If you say anything to anyone I will put you in the hospital” A few years later I am 13 – a neighbor who was deemed a mentor and role model introduced me to porn on what I now consider one of the most disgusting and revolting websites I have ever seen and portrayed it as funny and entertaining. I’m 14 a much older man strikes my arm in a work environment for using a swear word on break and I was asked if I could continue to work by my supervisor- I was investigated and fired because I spoke up after days of harassment by said man and told him to go away I am 17- my at the time ” best friend” makes a deal with her drug dealer to exchange my pussy for a high I woke up the next day with my pants over my face – that was how I lost my virginity 19 my first boyfriend strips me naked to inspect me because he has been away – hog ties me – graps and twists my flesh until I cry out and bleed – I still have scars on my breasts and legs to this day I became a avid drug user and self medicated through my twenties 30 – in my home for my birthday party my friends boyfriend leaves his drunk and passed out girlfriend in my guest room to enter my bedroom remove my pants and rapes me while I was passed out after a night of drinking and celebrating I was told that it was unfortunate that I perceived what happened the way that I did 31 my brother died of an overdose after years of agony because he to was abused 
"For the last two years I have been working for a Mountaineering Association based in the UK. During that time I consistently advocated the need for equality and diversity training in addition to promoting a better gender balance at a senior level e.g Board of Directors which were all male. One example of sexism was, when discussing the need to have women on the board of Directors, one Director responded, ‘Yes, but we have to make sure they can do the job,’!!!! I have recently submitted a 16 -page complaint on the whole issue, as a result of experiencing regular discrimination, and seeing other people be on the receiving end of the same culture. The association tried numerous tactics to intimidate me, and prevent me from submitting a complaint and are trying every tactic possible to wriggle out of addressing the problem. Its the most archaic and dysfunctional association I have ever encountered. "
"On a night out with my boyfriend, walking to the bar holding hands and there are two guys walk past, I stop and say to one guy that I liked his afro, still holding hands with my boyfriend and clearly not flirting, the guy then sees this as an invitation to grope my breasts. Needless to say my boyfriend was not happy. In high school, 16 years old, and I did badly in a practice maths test, as I was never good at the subject. My very sexist maths teacher told me that by doing badly at maths, I would never do well in life and probably become a prostitute. He had also previously called another girl in the class a ‘tart’ because she was looking in her mirror to get an eyelash out of her eye. Working in a bar I get some genuine compliments from sweet guys who leave me alone once I tell them I’m not interested, however on too many occasions have men been extremely inappropriate. My workplace is really warm, so when I go to work I have to wear shorts to keep cool, which results in conversations about my bum that they think I can’t hear. Once, in a previous job, a guy mimed fingering me while licking his lips, it made me feel so violated, ashamed and nauseated. I told my manager who was also my boyfriend at the time, and all he said was ‘well he’s drunk and you’re hot’. I refused to serve the guy again and left the boyfriend and the job. That’s not to mention the shouts of ‘show me your pussy’ from drivers which is far more frequent than I care to admit. I’m a stranger, what gives you the right? "

"While I was 23 and working as a seasonal driver helper with UPS in Texas, married drivers would tell me that other drivers asked if they were having sex with me in the back of their trucks on their routes. They commented on my jeans all the time, made kissing noises, stopped and stared (when asked why they were staring they just said, “I just want to look at you.”). Supervisors also made routine comments even when I told them to stop. I reported it and nothing happened. "

"I just read a story on here where the woman was harassed by her coworkers on account of her strong accent. I have a similar story, but unlike her, I am a non-native English speaker. One of the Directors at the company I worked for would use every opportunity to remind me how difficult it was to understand me, and how poor my language skills were in general. She never said that to my male coworkers with equally strong accents. One guy in particular ignored grammatical conjugations whenever he spoke, and no one held this against him. I, on the other hand, proofread my (male) boss’ every report, because he could not spell even if his life depended on it. By the way, I live and work in Canada, a country that prides itself on its multiculturalism. On another (unrelated) occasion, I asked colleague a question by email. After several weeks, I mentioned to someone how Mr.X never responded. My coworker replied: oh, X just does not like women. It was said so casually, as a well-known fact, like “it’s sunny outside”. X was never held accountable for his attitude, and from then on I had to find a male coworker, who’d be willing to relate my question to X and get a response immediately. "
"This happened many many years ago in the 1980’s but I still remember. At a workplace social function one of the male accountants, who I got on well with, said loudly in a group conversation “Come on Sue show us your growler”. I was taken aback but laughed. Young, didn’t know how else I should respond as wanted to be thought a good sport, liked, who knows. "
"I work in an elementary school and one of the men I work with got brave and said to me, “If you were ten years older I would have to have you. You got a nice booty.” I shook my head while saying that I didn’t want to hear it and he said, “C’mon you must get these comments all the time.” I was still shaking my head and then he apologized but the way I felt about it couldn’t be erased. I don’t feel very comfortable around him anymore and I had considered him a great acquaintance. Before then, he’d just put his arm around me and hold it there, and I should’ve moved away or something so he didn’t get the wrong idea, but after this comment the line was drawn. "
I was at a networking event and a man who I had never met before swore and laughed in an incredulous way when I passed him my card with my profession on it (traditionally male dominated industry).

"A while back I was carrying a damaged bag of ice to receiving (aka “the back”) at the store where I work. A guy shopping in the aisle I happened to walk down called out, “Hey, is that cold?” I frowned out of confusion (at the time, I was still new to feminism and what sexism and harassment look like) as it was obviously ICE for pete’s sake and said, “Yes.” He then laughed and said, “You don’t have to take everything so seriously.” Moron. And I wished I’d called him that. At least he didn’t question whether I was strong enough to carry it, I guess. It was 20 pounds but I had no problem with it.

"I was at work, and I was only me and one other guy working at the same time, and he was currently busy in the cellar. My boss wanted some tables moving in prep for that night, me and Greg are the same age, and out of the two of us I’m the one that goes to the gym. However my boss was insistent that the tables were to heavy for me to possibly lift, and that we would just have to wait until Greg was free and that I should see if there’s any washing up that needs doing. It really annoyed me at the time, that I’m considered weaker than him just because of who I am, he seams to have forgotten that ocaioanly I help do the cleaning and I move all of those tables on a semi regular basis.

"I’m an environmental auditor, black, young (26) and female – all of which I am consciously aware of on the job in an industry which has historically been dominated by white males aged over 50. When I started auditing at road construction sites, things were going better than I anticipated, and my inputs were taken seriously by the older men in charge at these sites. All was well for months, then one day as I arrived on the site, a security guard, the lowest ranking employee at the construction site called me over. I didn’t really want to, but in retrospect, I think my culture has “trained” me to be “nice” and respectful to people older than me, especially males. So I put on a plastic smile to be nice, walked over, and he proceeded to make a pass at me. I instantly felt sick to my stomach, and felt so degraded…but I just walked away without a word. I wanted to report him, I wanted to make him know that this was NOT okay. I didn’t though. Because that wouldn’t be “nice”. I had the authority to shut the construction site down if they didn’t comply to environmental standards, and yet the most junior employee felt he could try his chances with me. He was black, so that ruled out racism, and left my young and female characteristics which made him feel like he had a right to do that in the workplace. I may be wrong, but I feel like he wouldn’t dare treat an auditor who was male with disrespect. It didn’t end there. When I told a male friend about it, he instantly said I was in the wrong, and implied I was being elitist by saying I deserved his respect because I was higher on the corporate ladder. If that meant I was being elitist, so be it. I always treat everyone with respect, I greet cleaners, security guards, everyone, but in the case of the guard, HE treated ME with disrespect. I arrived as a professional, and he acted like I was simply a young maiden lining up to be chosen. Maybe viewing myself as a victim isn’t the answer. Maybe I shouldn’t be asking myself what the men I work with judge me as first when they see me. Auditor? Female? Young? Non-South African? (that is also an issue, xenophobia boils up all the time in this country). But I have never been taught how to handle these situations, and continue to battle with my beliefs that we are all equal, and my African conditioning which positions all women as subordinates to men – regardless of professional ranking (in Malawi, a female minister had to kneel in front of a male minister of the same rank). I have been abandoned by a great uncle at a family wedding we both went to in his car, yet he didn’t think I would maybe need a lift back. When I got back to their place 4 or 5 hours late (catching a lift from another relative), I was scolded by my great aunt for not being at the car at the time my great uncle was ready to go. He was clearly in the wrong, but because he was a couple of generations ahead of me, I had to respectfully shut up, and not stand my ground. I want to stand my ground in such situations, but how, when I have been bullied for so long into not doing so for fear of showing disrespect? "
"Target’s innovation lab put out a workplace promo video, likely in order to attract top talent. In this promo video, there’s not even one small part where women are shown in anything but a completely secondary, supportive position. There’s not one background shot of a woman leading a meeting or even speaking (I’m quite sure they probably let the women speak.) Why would you put together a promo video like that? So unattractive for the (admittedly few) leadership-qualified women in our industry. I have no problem with the fact the office leadership is all guys. The software/tech industry lacks qualified women in leadership. That’s most places. But, this video is how they choose to represent how ‘cool’ it is to work in their office.

"I have nearly finished 5 years of training to become a therapist. Despite the fact that I had almost daily contact with my parents for most of this time, he never one made any comment on my developing career. Well, that’s not quite true. He did one time. My mum mentioned that sometimes, talking to the neighbour over the garden fence can be better than therapy. My dad said that it’s always better. The only positive comment my dad has ever made about any concept of my future, was a time that I was at home as a teenager, and he was out on the road. I mentioned that I’d started cooking dinner, and he laughed and said that I’d make someone a great wife. I was so furious I couldn’t think of a way to answer without blowing up, so I just didn’t. "
"I was a professional creative writer for 3 years and was taken under the wing of an agent. I say ‘taken under the wing’ but mean it in the loosest way possible. I hadn’t done anything like this before and he ultimately turned out to be quite exploitative, not to mention two-faced. Since he had several projects going and my way of story planning is relatively technical, he sometimes asked me what I thought of other projects. On one occasion he asked me by email what I thought about some feminist comics. I had plenty to say on this subject, so I set aside about 90 mins to tell him what was on my mind, especially since most of his core projects were quite male-dominated, so perhaps he wasn’t well-versed in the female perspective. Either way, he’d asked, so I answered. Apparently my answer was too long. He emailed back, telling me that I had answered ‘too much’ and he had just wanted a couple of sentences’ worth of answer. Furthermore, he gave me the whole mansplain about how only idiots believe in 3rd-wave feminism and that there’s no longer any problem. Well, ladies! That finally puts *that* argument to rest, does it not? "
"New job. My boss is continually inappropriate towards me (and others) at work, constantly touching me, kissing the top of my head or cheek, and giving me little gifts, so that it’s not only making me look bad to my colleagues for favouritism, but making me super uncomfortable. After my first 8 weeks at the company we had our first social. I’d had a few drinks and ended up talking my mouth off to a colleague about how he was “lovely, but a bit inappropriate, don’t you think?”. Rumours spread quickly in the office and before long I was being ostracised, not only by my boss but other colleagues. Without saying anything directly to me, my boss made comments throughout the day whilst standing behind me- “well SOMEONE thinks I’m being a rapist, SOMEONE thinks I’m a pervert” etc. (you get the idea) making me paranoid and upset. I was made to feel like I’d made a mountain out of a molehill and quickly retracted my statements, claiming it was made in jest from drinking. I was joking. It was fine! And now? I just have to play the game. If he’s flirting/kissing/touching me, it is much easier to say nothing and get my bonuses. AND IT’S 2017 PEOPLE. "
"I was at work cleaning. I got on my knees to clean a bar fridge, and I guess my knees got a little dirty.

"At work a colleague recently got married. Soon after i heard two other male workmates talking about him. One said that the married guy had taken his wife’s surname. At this, the other man looked outraged and asked why the hell would he do that?? The first guy then made a whipping noise, and said he’s a fucking pussy, isn’t he, that’s why. It really annoyed me. I mean, how come it’s looked down upon if the wife’s name is preferred? Surely in this day and age a couple should just decide for themselves which surname is nicer, or even just stick with the names they’ve got, and it should be no big deal. Why is it really such an embarrassment for a man to give up his last name, when for centuries women have just been expected to do just that with no questions asked? "
"A male colleague asked me out a few months ago, and I politely declined as I’m in a long term relationship. For 5 months, he ignored me, made me feel awkward in work, refused to talk to me, made horrible comments about my boyfriend and sent me inappropriate messages and grabbed my bum as I walked past. I ignored it, thinking he would ‘get over it’. My manager asked to ‘have a word’ with me, and told me that he thought I should make an effort with my colleague. I told him I have no problem with him, and I’d like to carry on as normal in work. A week ago, my manager asked for a meeting and told me that my relationship with my colleague wasn’t working in the work environment, and it was ‘either me or him’ and I shouldn’t have rejected him, as rejecting him has made the workplace awkward in an all male environment (me as the exception), and as I have a degree, I’m ‘going somewhere in life’, said it was my fault for being ‘jailbait’ and dismissed me.

"I am a man. I was also assigned female at birth, so for a large portion of my life I was expected to present and behave as a female, and was perceived to be one. All the while, my mind thought and acted as a man, and I often was confused as to why I was being treated differently to other young men. Like my peers, I cracked typically “masculine” sounding jokes at the bar, and prior to transition these were rarely acknowledged, and I found myself commonly being ostracised as a result. I noticed women making these jokes as well, and they received the same lack of recognition. Prior transition, remarks were made about my high voice, and I found it to be a great effort to make my voice heard in all male environments. I assumed it was because it was physically not as loud, but I have since found out, that upon hearing a female sound, the other men ignored my comments by choice. That being said, while I was being perceived as a woman, people were more caring towards me. There was an assumption that I was inherently vulnerable, and so people insisted that I travelled home in cabs which they happily paid for, doors were opened for me, and I was offered help carrying heavy loads. One could argue that as a young man, I still need such assistance, but society dictates that I am no longer entitled to it in the way a woman would be. I was raised as a strong independent person, with the firm belief in my upbringing that gender was an arbitrary and irrelevant concept that was never going to hold me back. I believed this for many years. Unfortunately, it was only after beginning to live life as my true male self did I begin to discover the reality of sexism. I have gone from being a slightly bizarre and “eccentric” female, who was always held at wide birth, never fully being accepted on an equal level; to being a well liked and respected man. Other men were openly delighted after I came out as male. They made remarks, with good intentions, implying how much better my life was goin to be now that I was on the “winning side”. Nothing in my personality had changed; it was only my presentation that had miraculously “improved”. One could argue that I was simply experiencing difference between the gender roles. Unfortunately, I can say with conviction, that the world treats me better now that I am living as a man. The very reason that I am posting this account anonymously is because misogyny has made me feel a sense of shame about my history. I am fearful that should people learn of it, I might lose my newly established rights and status that I have since “earned” post transition. I defend none of it and my discoveries horrify me. "
"After a session at the gym, I was told by a colleague that girls shouldn’t have muscles, because it’s ugly. Apparently, girls should have lady lumps. So obviously now I’m going to work twice as hard when I’m doing weights so that I can look hot AF and prove him wrong. "
"I work for an agency that works with displaced peoples. Our staff are all highly trained social workers who have worked all over the world throughout their careers, in various cultures. We are mostly women (very common in the social work field). Sometimes we go into people’s homes, working with families and very personal situations. Every single one of us has experienced unwanted sexual advances from men while on the job. Besides dealing with the emotional trauma these experiences cause, we’ve had to develop a protocol on what to say/ how to get out of situations that are inappropriate or dangerous. We’ve also had meetings discussing strategies for hiring more male social workers, so they can be sent to work in areas where the women employees feel uncomfortable. Feeling unsafe on the job really detracts from our work. The mere fact that men they think they are entitled to make sexual advances on a woman while she is trying to do her job speaks volumes on how much is wrong with the world. This is a global issue. "

A women is just as capable as a man, we should all be judged equally, not by our gender. This aggravates me and frustrates me SO much. "
"While I was shelving books at my workplace, a 50+ year old man stared at my skirt and asked if I was of age because, apparently, I looked “stunningly gorgeous”. I told my friends that this happened afterwards. They told me I should stop making such a big deal, it was just a compliment. "

"I’m a junior in high school (17 years old) and I went to a series of workshops with a high school club based on building leadership in students. One of the workshops that I went to was “You Go Girl!”, and was supposed to be about how to become a successful leader in the workplace as a woman. For 30 of the 45 minutes, we were lectured on makeup and business attire (“contouring is key!” “a pencil skirt should be at the knees or an inch above” “girls, buy yourself a makeup brush set”) even though there was a separate workshop that dealt with business attire. Almost everything said had to do with appearance. I didn’t learn any actual skills that could be applied in work situations. Then, at the very end, we did an exercise where we listed “10 things we love about guys”, “10 things we hate about guys”, and “10 things all women should have, or know how to do”. As if doing irritating things like forgetting to take out the trash are male-exclusive. And, as an example for the latter, the speaker said, “you know, like all guys should know how to change a tire, what should girls know how to do?” Why shouldn’t GIRLS know how to change a tire, too? Do we have to be dependent on guys for all things like that? Ugh. So much for feeling empowered. "

When accusing him of being sexist, always the standard reaction ” you have no sense of humor”. Pathetic and disgusting.

"I am 23 and trying to save money to support me during my post graduate degree at UCL. I work at two pubs and the most stark similarity between the two is the way that some men feel they can talk to me just because I am a woman.

I always dress work appropriately, not one inch of skin showing. **I DON’T THINK THIS MATTERS, ALL WOMEN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT REGARDLESS OF EDUCATION, WEALTH, WHAT THEY ARE WEARING, CLASS, BACKGROUND**. I am merely adding context to my situation. I am respected intellectually, I always try to be a kind person, I am a supportive friend. In all other situations I have been treated as an equal, as an inidivual worthy of respect. But it doesn’t matter at all to these men. These old men, men who brag about how many children they have fathered from so many different women, men who boast about being in jail… make the most disgusting comments to my colleagues and to me. To them, I am not an equal. I am a being to be laughed at. “You look even sexier in your glasses, I wish you were wearing a right white shirt and tie, and a little black skirt for me.” “Come over here sweetcheeks.” (While I adjusted my jeans) “Oh fiddling with your knickers are you? Getting tomorrow’s dirty laundry ready.” (They were talking anout about pets) “Oh I bet you have loads of rabbits HAHAHAHA”. (They were talking about swimming) “Do you like breaststroke? HAHAHA” All while I am on one side of the bar and they all (always when more than one of them are present) sit on the other. I try to be strong and stand my ground and not take their shit, but it is getting harder and harder to go into work. I am so angry that no matter how kind, how hard working, how successful in any sphere a woman is, she can be reduced to a figure of mockery by men with baser minds than her. "

"I used to work in a small, independent coffee shop. The ‘chef’ used to constantly ask me out on dates and be generally inappropriate when it was just the two of us. The situation reached its apex when he whispered in my ear ‘let me smell your white stuff’. I told the owner, a woman, about what was said and she replied ‘you know what men are like’. It’s sickening. "
"In Chennai, India we have shared cab systems that are used by a lot of people (about half of them girls, before you ask). It was a hop-on hop-off thing for a flat rate. One day, it was really crowded, and a man decided to use the opportunity to discreetly grope my breast while pretending to indifferently look out the window. As soon as I sensed the inappropriate touch I got uncomfortable but his expression made me feel like maybe the whole thing was accidental. However when he kept doing it, I can’t imagine why the maximum courage I could muster was to glare at him. He stopped then, but when I got off, he followed me. I freaked out because you don’t want a pervert like that knowing where you live. When I told this to others, their first reactions were always ‘it’s just a boob grope, happens all the time, just forget it’ or more along the lines of ‘ what else did you expect getting into one of those shared cabs that late in the night’ (9 pm really?) Eventually I realized that this guy was from my workplace and HR had him suspended for about 2 weeks. It’s not that I can’t ‘shrug it off’ or ‘get over it’, it’s just that I’d rather not have to go through that ‘oh shit’ moment of real terror when everything changes from regular to creepy. I hate reliving it every time a pervert decides they’re going to have some fun. "
"My boss at work is known to be a little creepy, but today while talking to me in private he touched my thigh and ran it about a centimetre up my leg. I was so shocked that I didn’t say anything, and now I feel like I can’t confront him about it. A scary world for a young woman. "
"The language used in the world around me is what strikes me most pointedly – if a woman at work raises a point a second time after something has not been completed, we are accused of ‘whingeing’ ‘moaning’ – terms which I have not seen used towards a man in the same environment. A colleague, when talking politics, will always raise the point of how female politicians look, how old or unfashionable, comments on clothing, hair and make up, whereas these same points are not made about males in the public eye. The expectations and assumptions made about the roles of the women at work as carers, cleaners, tea makers – all hidden, all so ingrained that if raised they are denied as being expressions of sexism. My previous position at the company was disadvantaged as I could not / would not go out on nights out partly due to commitments, partly because I didn’t enjoy it – I soon realised this is where the power in the company played itself out. Recently when i ‘dared’ (because yes it does feel like throwing yourself into the lions) to raise one of these issues, my colleague said ‘oh, you are such a feminist’ – the negative connotations of which allowed him to use this word as an insult. This is a brilliant project and I hope it goes some way to unpicking what many see as ‘natural’ differences, roles and inequalities and driving home the message that they are socially constructed and can therefore be deconstructed.

"I have spent 11 years forging a successful career in business but still I see miserable examples of sexism in the workplace. In a management meeting a week ago my CEO described one of our (very successful) clients as ‘was she the hot one?’ followed by giggles from the male managers. Worse still my female boss also laughed and said it was behaviour to be expected. Why!?! Then they had two of the female junior marketing and web designers serve us water and bring us pizza as the meeting overran into lunch but the guy at the same level as them was left to continue working, despite the fact he’s not even good at his job! Ugh! Incredible! "

"At work today, both me and another male colleague had brought pasta from home for lunch and coincidentally it was exactly the same, macaroni with meat sauce. Another colleague comments that our meals look exactly alike, how come, jokes around a bit. I joke back saying indeed our meals are the same, but mine is certainly better. The first male colleague (who has the same meal as I do) replies back “You know Mariana it’s sexist to assume that your meal is better than mine just because you’re a woman”. This comment today struck me as absolutely out of context, I was absolutely caught off guard and surprised to be surprised since indeed he’s casually sexist continuously. In this occasion today I replied back that I was sure mine was better not because of sexism but because of personal differences of taste, my pasta simply looked better. He’s pasta was very clearly overcooked and the sauce too dry. His sexist remarks assuming I was making that comment because of sexism really hit my nerves today. This colleague repeatedly casually makes sexist comments and I regularly let him know I dislike it. He sees me as feminist and doesn’t like it, often jokingly letting me know that he dislikes it. For instance this colleague often makes the joke, a few times even in front of all our colleagues, that women from my country are known for not shaving their armpits or having moustaches. It’s difficult and frustrating to live in a world where in your workplace you have to deal with such bullshit comments from men. "
"There have been so many, and I’ve been so ashamed that I’ve never told most of these to anyone. I’m too old to pretend this didn’t happen anymore. When I was 7 and told I wasn’t very good at math, maybe I should focus on art and history instead. When I was 12 and suddenly was a C cup, and got my bra snapped in school and the teachers did nothing. When I was 13 and bullied for being either a lesbian or slut. (I had never so much as seen genitals… and I was straight). When I was 18, at a friend’s house, chatting on her bed with my legs propped up and a friend of her brother’s shoved the end of a broomstick into my crotch, against my jeans. My friend apologized for him, he never did. When I was 23 and too drunk to consent at that party, but none of my girl friends helped me. When I was in my early 20s and a coworker repeatedly commented on the color of my underwear and allowed a trainee to grab me by the pussy, but the company refused to take action and a lawyer told me I had no case, so I quit my job and tried to forget about it. When I was 27, and my cousin asked me if I was going to quit my job when I finally had children, and then was offended when I said no. “When” I have kids. As if it was a given, and my career, which I love and work hard at, is just a stepping stone to marriage. (still don’t have kids). When I couldn’t walk down any city street across the multiple cities and countries I’ve lived in without having to ignore street harassment. When my (otherwise supportive) dad told me paternity leave was unrealistic, because his job would be compromised if he took months off at a time. What the fuck do you think happens when women take maternity leave?! For these reasons and so, so many more… we need feminism more than ever. Especially with that orange, misogynist, bottom feeding blob that will be deciding our health care soon. "

"I wasn’t really bothered about sexism until I had my son. When I returned to work 3 days a week I was genuinely surprised and confused to find myself overlooked and excluded from projects and meetings I would ordinarily have been involved in. When I realised what was going on, I started looking around for other jobs, only to find that there were no part-time professional jobs out there in the job market. I could have applied for a full time position and perhaps negotiated a 4 day week but I really wanted 3 days so I could be there for my son. I have since gone self employed which has worked really well for me but all the mums at school have the same problem and have either given up their career, are stuck in the company they worked for pre-children with no pay rises or promotions since, or are doing other, more flexible work, which is poorly paid. This situation is also sexist against men. Most of the dads I speak to don’t want to be the pressure of being the sole breadwinner and want to be more involved in parenting but don’t have the option to go part-time or choose not to because they know it will impact negatively on their career. This is a ridiculous waste of resource, is a barrier to good parenting and is blatantly sexist! It takes a man and a woman to have a child, it is not just the responsibility of women to raise the next generation and it really pisses me off when female single parents get a bad rap – are we missing the rather blatant fact the father is nowhere to be seen. Contraception is not just the responsibilty of women! "

"I work at a Bicycle shop in the Midwest. I love to tinker with, ride, and be around bikes so it’s become the perfect job for me. It has also become a regular daily battle against workplace sexism. So many of our male costumers listen to my advice when I answer their questions and then go to my boss, who is a male, who either refers them back to me or repeats exactly what I have told them. They just NEED to hear it from a man. Sometimes men completely ignore me and won’t talk to me at all or will be rude to me until I send my male boss to talk to them. I don’t understand why so many men seem to think I don’t belong in this industry. I haven’t seen one bicycle that you need a penis to operate. "
"I was criminally harassed by a woman twice my age a few months ago. She managed to find me on facebook and soon after sent me hundreds of threatening messages. She contacted my workplace, my family and my friends. She told me she was going to “find” me, and that when she did she would “violate and ravage” me. I called the police in July, as far as I know she’s yet to encounter any consequences apart from a restraining order. "

"They said they didn’t consult with me about the acting senior manager job because they knew I liked to work 4 days a week and rn my other business. I said shame you didn’t ask. I’ve worked out how to do my job in less time and instead of taking your money for doing a 5 day week I’ve used that day to create an international business and earn more than you. Now I’ve got my own team running the business i would have had time to go full-time as senior manager. Then they told me Peter was an up and coming young man and they wanted to keep him, I of course was critical to the business in my position. Sorry I said, I’ve heard that a few times before. After 23 loyal years I applied for a job with another company and got a whopping pay rise. HR rang me and told me they’d worked out they need three people to replace me. Well I guess Peter will get right on to hiring them. "

"When I was 16-17, in my last few years of school, I was the only girl in a class full of boys. It was a pretty ‘laddish’ atmosphere and for a full year this seemed to mean I was the target of their jokes: these ranged from whether I was on my period to whether I shaved my legs and of course a lot of sexual stuff, especially about me being a lesbian – I’m not, and I don’t even think they thought I was, but I didn’t have a boyfriend and didn’t get with the guys at school so maybe it made sense to them? Weirdly I don’t think they disliked me, or even meant it in a particularly ill-willed way, it just seemed like how they thought they should behave as a room full of guys and really, when you spoke to them on their own, they were perfectly nice! The thing that depressed me most (and does depress me now) is the reaction of the two (male) teachers who took this class, one of which I got on with really well apart from this. Neither really did anything to stop this kind of treatment, or challenged the guys on the stuff they were saying, and in a way I think that stopped me asking for help at the time because I just thought it was normal, or that I was expected to shrug it off. The best part was when one of the teachers, who is very left-leaning politically, mentioned how he hated stuff like sexism and racism – I immediately challenged him about the class he’d run for half a year to which he replied (a little shocked I think) ‘But that’s just banter [i.e. good natured joking], isn’t it!’ and I remember saying ‘No it isn’t!’ . This must have made him think a bit because later he actually apologised to me for the way he’d let the class carry on. I think when you are young it’s hard to know what’s OK and what isn’t and it’s difficult to know how to deal with things when you don’t like the behaviour of your peers. I remember asking my female friends about it when I’d put up with the class for most of the year and they told me to ‘stand up for myself’ but this isn’t always easy: I didn’t really have the inclination (or imagination) to trade sexual insults with the guys, and I worried that it would just make them worse to me. Now I don’t really know if I would stand that kind of treatment again, or like to see it meted out to others (like a guy in an all-girl workplace or something). I wanted to write this here just in case some teacher does happen to read it, because if my leftie teacher (who was otherwise a really great guy) couldn’t recognise sexism when he saw it then none of us have a chance! I think if there is ‘banter’ going on (especially in a classroom or at work when people are kind of forced together) it’s worth questioning whether everyone’s in on the joke and it’s so important to make clear to young people that making jokes about someone just because, y’know, their genitals are different is not OK. I think if some of those guys had been challenged at the time both them and I would have been able to consider what was acceptable and it might have been a more wholesome experience all round! "
"I live my life fast. I eat very quickly, I speak very quickly, I do my work quickly and efficiently and, when I need to go somewhere, I go there quickly. This is just how I am. I feel like I’m wasting time to do things at any pace other than quickly. So why is it that whenever I speak, people, usually men and, more usual still, male co-workers, feel the need to tell me to calm down? They tell me to relax, that it’ll be okay, not to worry. They pay no mind to the fact that I’m not distressed or upset or perplexed in any way, I’m merely speaking at the pace to which I’m accustomed. Why is it that, even when they’re around me enough to know this, they still say things like this as though they were dealing with a hysterical woman, as opposed to one who is speaking quickly and at a sociable volume. The same thing happens when they see me walking quickly. Moreover, people constantly comment on my eating speed. I’ve NEVER heard anyone comment on how quickly a man eats. I would be a very wealthy woman if I had a quarter for every time someone, usually men, commented about how I inhale my food, how it’s bad for my digestion, how they could never eat as swiftly because they like to enjoy their food etc etc. I’ve NEVER had digestion problems and I enjoy my food just fine. One particularly creepy incident was during a ball at university. I was seated next to a date of a classmate. I did not know this man, but about half way through dinner, it became clear he was mocking me. I, as well as everyone else at the table, noticed that he was STUFFING food into his mouth, barely chewing and making exaggerated “om nom nom” sounds while giving me the side eye and smirking at me every few moments as food fell from his over stuffed mouth. I was in shock. I eat quickly, I don’t eat like an uncivilised pig. No one said anything to him. No one says anything to any of these men. How I speak and eat doesn’t impact anyone else, but I and other women are still policed and badgered while neary a word is said to men, even when they’re pettily harassing and even humiliating women about these things. This needs to stop. "
"I am a married woman in her early 30s. A few weeks ago an older male work colleague requested to be friends on Facebook. He started private messaging me regularly, pointing out how “single” he was and asking for my personal phone number so he could “tell me something really private” because he “really trusts me.” I didn’t give him my number, pointed out that I was spending the holidays with my HUSBAND, and hoped he would leave it at that. The next week, he left me another message telling me that I wear great skirts, stockings, and boots. I work very hard. I want to be valued at work based on the value of my work and for what I bring to the team. This is NOT appropriate, and it is not OK. "

Though I worked with Greek and Spanish and Asian men who spoke English quickly with thick accents and I even worked with a Polish man who spoke no English at all (Yes, he was expected to interact with and help non-Polish speaking customers), I was the only one to be constantly reprimanded for my speech. I, a native English speaking woman who was so talented and interested in the language and literature that I earned an honours degree in the subject at university, was constantly told by people who were no where near as well versed in English as I that my English was terrible. I was constantly asked by co-workers why I spoke so strangely and why I was so stupid. My co-workers were never disciplined for these remarks. My bosses kept, for the entirety of my employment, nagging me to dumb down my language and to speak more slowly and to try to “fix” my accent. The same was never asked of my co-workers with equally strong accents. As I’ve mentioned, I had several co-workers who didn’t even speak English. Prior to being hired, I was asked several times if I was sure I spoke English, because they’d never have hired me otherwise. We performed many of the same roles, regarding customer interactions. The only people who NEVER had a problem with my speech/accent? The customers themselves. . . "

"I worked in a cafe with a customer base of government personnel, police and public servants. I remember clearly serving a table of four middle aged men, all dressed in suits. I had noticed one staring and me and holding my gaze whenever I glimpsed him looking. I was uncomfortable and felt watched. When I took the men their coffee he stroked my hand and ‘complimented’ my looks. The other three men watched the exchange silently and did not tell him it was innapropriate to address a 20 year old waitress sexually. They said nothing and I walked away with my hand shaking. I then washed it. I was furious, as I often am, that men believe they have a right to address and touch women how they like. I was furious that none of his companions spoke up. But more then that I was furious that I felt it more socially acceptable to smile and say ‘oh thank you’ then call him out on his behaviour. To make this clearer, I had typed “while this may seem an extreme response…”, until I realised that this in itself is subconsciously reinforcing the social acceptance of sexual harassment. Later that month, another waitress was harassed. While doing her job a group of men asked her to join them for lunch, repeatedly and persistently. When she refused and went about her work, one told her “good you could use the exercise.” This incredible wonderful friend of mine cooled off her anger inside, went back to their table and asked this man to leave. She told him that he made her uncomfortable and had no right to comment on her appearance or her weight. She told him that he did have a right to comment on her service but that was all. She then told the man he would not be welcome at our cafe again. Later on in the day one of the other men returned, he acknowledged and apologised for his workmates behaviour. I am striving to take a leaf out of her book. Lets not put up with sexist crap. "

"I started work as an Engineering Technician at a UK university a few months ago. All the people I work with are absolutely lovely and really friendly (also predominantly male), however most of them seem to have the same quirk – they don’t want to swear in front of me. And they make it quite explicit that it’s because I’m female. “There’s a lady present”, “don’t use that kind of language in front of Hannah”, that kind of thing. The funny thing is that I swear quite a lot. By the time of the Christmas party I’d had enough, a comment was many about swearing in my company and I lost my cool a little, I said “I’ve actually heard swear words before, just because I’m female doesn’t mean that I haven’t heard or used swear words!”.

About a week after that, the same co-worker compared me to another female employee and said “but you’re all women”. As if pitting e against another women based on our bodies was meant to be compliment. In the same workplace, with another co-worker also in a superior position to me, I mentioned that a client looked familiar to me and he said “well she’s hot, I’d totally rape her”. "
"I work in a male dominated workplace and today heard myself referred to at the other end of a phone line as “Jane with the boobies”, not only was this from colleagues I work with on a day to day basis but I also make a conscious effort, because of the environment, to never dress in any way that could be construed as provocative. Yet I am still reduced to two physical attributes by men who I outrank. "
"I work for a progressive and inclusive world-wide company yet during lunch with 2 male colleagues everytime I challenge anything sexist they say or a feminist topic is brought up they: roll their eyes, tell me to “calm down”, derail the conversation by stating “not all men …”, make it about themselves, get incredibly defensive and red-faced with frustration that a ‘mere woman’ is challenging them, say I’m being rude and attacking them, refuse to believe what I say (women always lie apparently and just hate men), belittle and patronise me, label me and all women as ‘crazy’, but most of all, and what angers me the most, they NEVER LISTEN TO ME. Instead of just listening and taking in what I’m saying as lived truth and what one half of the population experiences on a daily basis they do all of the above. "
"When I received my A Level results and confirmation of my place at university, my male boss said “Why are you even bothering with university? Just find yourself a good husband, there’s a good lass”. This is 2016 and girls/women are still made to feel as though they have to prove themselves as worthy of receiving the same education as men. "
"Talking to a guy at work and I mentioned that a girl was wearing a see-through top and I was wondering if it was appropriate for the workplace… Him: “it would be ok if she was younger, 25 has to be the cutoff Me: “I disagree but you’re missing my point, my question is whether or not anyone should be wearing a see-through top to the office?” Him: “yeah I get ya, if she were in better shape, more toned, it’d be ok Me: “well again I don’t agree, someone’s size/age/gender/etc shouldn’t dictate what they can and can’t wear, if it’s ok for one then it’s ok for everyone and vice versa” Him: “makes you wonder how she got that job…” "
"A few years ago in my workplace, a young man who works there began arguing with me about a work related issue, and accused me of doing something I hadn’t done. I attempted to defend myself and tried to reiterate several times that he was wrong in what he was saying was incorrect and that I hadn’t done anything wrong. Eventually, he became abusive and screamed at me that I was a “Fucking psycho c**t” (a reference to the fact that I suffer from depression) and that I was a “dirty slut”. I screamed back at him, but eventually began crying and tipped a stack of trays over in temper. I was disciplined for this. There were approximately ten witnesses who heard what he had called me and not one of them had the courage to tell the truth, and instead turned it around to make it seem as though it were my fault. Interestingly, this same individual also told a black man that he worked with “your face doesn’t fit around here”. When the man reported this, nothing was done about this, either. "
"I’m doing temp work, which could lead into a permanent contract. Today my supervisor pulled me aside and told me that I’ve “been constantly seen” with a male colleague during my breaks. I told her it’s because we are friends and like to smoke, chat, and eat lunch together. Plenty of people have friends around the workplace in such a manner. She told me in not so many words that unless I stop “being seen” with him, I won’t be offered a permanent position with the company. In-house relationships ARE allowed with that company for starters, yet I told her my colleague and I are simply friends, and reminded her I have a partner at home to whom I am faithful. She repeated her warning, so I told her I got the point and will stop hanging with him at work, but I found it depressing. Having that time with my buddy is pretty much the highlight of an otherwise ordinary day. Same genders can hang out as much as they like, and yet there seems to be a huge drama and constant gossip when people of opposite genders decide to be friends in the workplace. Sexism is beyond annoying, and now it’s threatened my job security. "
"I don’t know if my story counts, as it is a bit different from the vast majority of other stories I see here. But: I always run into men who catcall me about hideously ugly I am. Also, at my workplace, men comment about my ugly appearance as well (not to my face, but I somehow find out sooner or later…). It just seems that women have to deal with this, whereas I rarely see this sort of thing happen to men on such a frequent basis??? It’s almost as if men, and the rest of society, are angry with me for not looking the way a woman is supposed to look like (pretty). I don’t know. "
"After reading your book I’ve been inspired to make a diary of my own, that i will note down anytime i suffer from any sexual harassments or see something i as a 21 year old women in the 21st century know is unacceptable. I work in a restaurant/bar and have to deal with men making vulgar comments on an almost daily basis. I am feisty and like to clap back and stand my ground, when i do so i get in trouble from management for being rude to customers. But the story I really wanted to share with you is one that i think is really unacceptable. My friends and i were walking home from the shop one day before a night out, wearing joggers, trainers, jumpers etc, (i mention this to diminish any “provocative clothing” ideas) and a group of young guys walked by us. They started jeering at us “aw man you’re so hot” blah blah blah. When one piped up “Aw man, if I went to your uni, i would rape you”.. When he said it I was genuinely shaken. I argued back and was then started on aggressively meaning my friend and i had to run back to our flat. I know this is probably not the worst story you’ve heard, but it is one that i often discuss with peers and feel needs to be addressed. I am writing my sociology essay and will be referencing your book so if you could i would love to discuss ideas with you. my email address is melissajayross@gmail.com "
"I joined the company 5 months before it all started. We went up to the North of England for a conference and he insisted in staying over night and seeing another client the following day. At that time I was going trough some health issues and he knew about it. He asked me how I was handleing it and kissed me after my reply. I freeze and decided to go up to my room. It was “just” a kiss and it wasnt worth the trouble- that was the “sensible” answer from my friends when I asked them whether I should go to HR and report the situation. Eventually I decided to talk to him but not to go to HR. He apologized for his behaviour and said he had to many drinks, he promised it wouldnt happen again. About 6 months later, my team went out on a dinner with one of our suppliers and eventually it was just he and me alone at the pub. The rest of the department was on a night out in another pub but he refused to go there as it wasnt “a fun plan”. I was joking with the table next to us in the pub and when I did the same joke to him he laughed said “Stop it bitch”. I was shocked by what he said and asked him to apologized but he refused. I thought he didnt listen to me and asked him to apologize again. He refused for a second time. I thought he didnt understand I felt offended when he called me bitch and asked him to apologize for a third time. He refused and laughed at me. I took my stuff and left the pub. When I reached the closest train station he rang me and asked me to help him as he was lost and didnt know how to get to his hotel (he doesnt live in London). I felt I couldnt hang up because he was my manager and accepted to pick him up and take him to the train station so he could get to the hotel. He apologized for his behaviour and said it was all a cultural missunderstanding because I am not from the UK. He said that is how he speaks to another (male) colleague – even though I never heard him calling him bitch. He apologized and said it was a shame the good atmosphere of the team could be ruin for sth like this and suggested to have another drink before heading home. We had another drink and I have blackouts of that night after that. I cant remember how or why but we ended up at his hotel. I dont remember undressing myself but I was naked on the bed. He started kissing me all over my body, I told him to stop and said no no no several times. He didnt stop. The following morning he commented on how I said no before saying yes. I still dont know what he meant by that. I talked to him and his excuse was “I thought it was what you wanted, it takes two to tango”. After months of agony I reported it to the Head of the department and decided to go to the police too. The company offered to relocate me in a different team (within the same department, which meant seeing him several times a week) or garden leave. The police said they had to file the case because of the lack of evidences. I left and I am now looking for a new job but glad I took that decision. I feel more empowered than ever. "
"Part of my financial aid for university allowed me to work at a library on my college campus. I got the job as soon as I enrolled and within five a weeks a young man came up to my desk and informed me that he had seen me there several times and wanted to talk to me. I think, okay not too bad, but now that I knew he was there, I start seeing him stare at me from across the building. He wouldn’t say anything, just stare until he came up to me and then he’d compliment whatever necklace or shirt I had on, but he wouldn’t be looking at my accessories. Then he started to appear outside my gym whenever I’d finished exercising or follow me into restaurants. I told myself it was a small college town, this was bound to happen, even as he started appearing outside my classes, pacing back and forth in the hallways. My coworkers and boss started to notice he would come up to my desk and stand over it, staring down my shirt and mumbling to himself. They started to find things for me to do to stay away from him, but they asked that I report it and I thought he was just a harmless, unusual creepy, individual, perhaps with some sort of social disability or anxiety. The stress was piling up, I started taking self defense lessons, but seeing him everywhere staring and following me was eating away at my mental health. I started having nightmares, didn’t want to leave my room and was physically ill. The day I finally reported him he followed me back to my building in nearly a full tilt run, thankfully I had a friend with me who called the police, but the police told me there was nothing they could do other than if I called them when he was ogling me at work, they could tell him to stop staring. It was only after I called my father in tears, who when he called the police only then did they agree to make an incident report of him following me home. My boss and I filed the paperwork for a no contact order the next day, but it only keeps him twenty feet away from me, and he can still stare at me from across the room at work so long as he initiates no contact when I’m just trying to do my job. I keep up with my martial arts and I keep working, but I can’t wait to graduate and get away from him. "
"For the last 2 years I have worked in a male dominated workplace as the only female in my department. There is one man, well and truly old enough to be my father, who believes that his status as a man gives him the right to verbally, and sometimes physically, attack me on a daily basis. He started out asking me on dates and to come to his house despie being well aware that I had a boyfriend and had been in a relationship for 2 years at the time. He used to tell me that ‘I care about you and like you a lot’. I made it entirely clear that, boyfriend or not, I would not EVER be interested. For the next year and a half his daily verbal attacks would become so blatantly obvious that other men in my department would complain to my manager on my behalf. The turning point for me came when he berated me for something that was not my responsibility and I retaliated by telling him to ‘go away’. This man is not my manager or any form of superior to me. He grabbed me by my shoulder, squeezed it hard and said ‘as a woman, it is your job to respect men and you need to learn how to do that’. I went straight to my manager and complained. 12 ‘warnings’ and a year and a half later and nothing has been done. He has admitted to my mananger that he has an ‘infatuation’ with me and they refuse to do anything for fear of retribution from him. I have been warned that it will ‘ruin my reputation’ if I go to WorkCover to have him fired. That is their sticking point. They are worried about my reputation. "
"Background: Me and my male boss are in a big meeting with about 10 of our clients. We let them know that I am leaving for a new job. Me: Don’t worry!

My male boss: No…..I’m not pretty enough Everyone in the meeting: *Hearty laughter* Me: …………………………. __________________________ What makes me valuable to my employer is my hard work and specialised skill set! Why are we joking about reducing me to my looks??? "
"I work as an English teacher in a country where sexism is extremely commonplace and is somewhat undealt with because of the cultural image attached to women as people who should be submissive and quiet. This never really posed a problem for me until recently, where I have been receiving a number of extremely inappropriate comments from a student of mine. It first started quite innocently, but lately, it has started to make me feel really uncomfortable and distracted in the class. Such comments include, ”I like your shirt, it’s see-through…”, ”do I pique your interest?”, ”Alison, Alison, give me some (whispered in my ear as I walked down the hallway in the school)”, ”24/7, you are so sexy”, and to top it off, last week when no other student showed up except for him, he asked me if I wanted to go to a bar with him for a ”private lesson” to do some ”extracurricular activities”. I feel so disgusted every Friday that I am faced with this person. Worst of all, these comments are generally said in front of other students who also become extremely uncomfortable with the whole situation. I told my manager about this issue and, although she was very sympathetic about my dilemma, did not make any effort to revisit the subject after I told her, nor try in any way to ensure he could not attend my class. (she also mentioned that the student is ”not goodlooking”, as if that would solve the situation!) I must note that this is a private academy where the students have to pay alot of money to attend, so I guess she doesn’t want to get in trouble by causing a student to leave the school and request a refund for the lessons he didn’t take. This also puts pressure on me to not ask him to stop being inappropriate towards me. I understand that he probably thinks this is all supposed to be a joke of some kind, but I can’t help feeling extremely uncomfortable around him, and I also feel that it is directly affecting how I teach in my class. This is my first experience of sexism in the workplace, and I wish there is more that could be done to highlight this problem, especially in a culture where it is so widely accepted. "
"My sister has a stalker. He tracked down her address and turned up at her house one day so she called the police to report him but they refused to take any action since she didn’t know his full name or address, which is apparently a requirement for filing. He turned up to her workplace the next day to abuse her for calling the police. The fact that our laws are set up to protect attackers, not victims, is horrifying. "
"Last week my male boss sat me down to explain his thoughts on my female managerâ€™s replacement as she has resigned. Since she returned to work from maternity leave, things have not been ideal and there is friction between her male maternity cover and the male boss as the maternity cover contract was extended for no apparent reason. The cause is the bromance between boss and managerâ€™s maternity cover. I am good at my job and was led by a very professional supervisor before her leave. So, what happens with her position is very important for my career progression. Not only did the boss explain everything (too much information), bad mouth my managerâ€™s working style, but praised her replacement, I was not only blindsided, but a little shocked. My manager has been asked to make a case for me to take her position, which she has, however the boss decided she was making it personal and it wasnâ€™t a true reflection, which he decided to tell to me, so not only insulting my supervisor, but me at the same time. So he is transparent he also said male colleague should move up in salary, so now not sure what to do with me. Basically he had already decided male colleague would get the position. I got a very poor apology via email the next day, but final outcome pending. "
"Aged 17 I worked at a supermarket. One particular man, I guess late 40s, repeatedly came in. He was extremely tall and broad. This would all be fine of course, however every time he came in he would come to my cashier insisting I tell him about myself, my birthday, where I lived, what I did, what I liked, of course I didn’t answer, as I felt insecure about telling a stranger these things. After a few visits, he escalated him behaviour, calling me various adjectives ranging from pretty to sexy, all I found inappropriate and didn’t respond to. He would lean over the till trying to grab my face, arm, shoulder, anything. One of my male work colleagues clocked on to how uncomfortable this made me, insisting they served him instead, but he would still lean over, saying things like “you know she wants to talk to me” and “she’s just playing”. I was very grateful of my colleagues actions, but it didn’t stop him. When Christmas came around he presented me with a card, containing his number and various COMPLETELY inappropriate and sexual suggestions. This made me particularly shaken, close to tears I went and told my manager, who, as a female, I thought would understand why this sexual harassment in the workplace was so very wrong and ban him from the store. Instead, she laughed and said “he just took a shine to you”. It didn’t stop, I worked there for a year, complained regularly, but it didn’t stop. I didn’t feel safe in my own place of work, this was only perpetuated by my managers who, unlike my lower position colleague, cared more about customer satisfaction than their employees safety. To this day I am immediately scared of older men, often without any justification. That man made me stereotype men, be scared of men who mean me no harm. He had no right to harass me, intimidate me, or belittle me and he has broken down my self confidence and self assurance, making me believe I am almost constantly at risk. "

Have had the same accountant since 2010. I’m the Finance Director of the company my husband and I own. He very rarely has any dealings with the accountant – I’m the one who deals with all that side of the business. I even go bowling with the main accountant. They get a new tax adviser – and he emails my husband. WHAT does a woman have to do? 
"I replied ‘hello’ to the cafe manager as I was ordering my lunch. Little did I know a man standing behind me wanted to invade my space. The same day he telephoned my work reception with my description and my first name that he had overheard from the cafe manager. Reception gave him my surname. A few days later he telephoned my home and told me he fancied me and asked me for a date. Needless to say I now have a ‘silent number’ and my workplace has changed its’ reception policy. Be aware that some counter staff ask you to confirm your name, phne number or address loudly in public. Anyone could be listening. "
"I was struggling to find something on my computer at work. I announced it in my (mainly female) office, to be told: ‘typical bloke, can’t multi-task’. Can you imagine the reaction if the roles were reversed? ‘Typical female, can’t handle technology’. I (correctly) would have been called out. Don’t undermine your arguments by tarring all men with the same brush. I know women suffer disproportionately from sexism, for historic and cultural ressons but two wrongs… "
"When I moved up to Manchester for university I needed to get a job. So I started working for an agency, working mainly as a waiter. One day when we were setting up the area for the service in the evening, a female manager (about 15 years older than me) singled me out in front of the group and told me that I was “fit” and then told me she liked my bum. After that, twice the same night older women, who I was serving, objectified me again. I never went back "
"I work in my husband’s bicycle shop. It is a mostly male dominated area of retail although it is getting better. I work with 4 male coleagues and they recognise that i some time face sexism and they are really supportive. To make things a bit easier and lighter we have a “chauvinistic corner” into which we stand out of fun everytime we experience a moment of sexism. It is sometimes really funny and we just laugh about it. My husband and I only have a VW van that we both drive. One day – while my husband is working abroad- i take the van to work as i needed to deliver a couple of bits and i parked it outside the shop. A male friend of my husband’s comes to the shop and is looking for my husband. I tell him that he is abroad. He says: “Really? I saw the van outside!” Now, is it only men who are allowed to drive a van, ffs?! Or another day, when again my husband is abroad, I am in the shop getting ready to open and I am there only with a 16 year old work-experience lad and a customer starts to knock on the window wanting me to open for him so that he can have an opinion on his broken bike. I open the door and he starts showing me what the problem is. It is a simple puncture and he is completely confused and can’t work out why there is no air in his tyre. In the middle of his explaining that he was just riding along and all of a sudden there is no air in his tyre we are joined by the work-experience lad and the man starts to talk to him and starts showing him the flat tyre and completely blanks me. I just sigh and let him talk and wait for the lad to ask me what to do. Honestly….. "
I applied for an internal post at work alongside three other colleagues who all happened to be male. I didn’t get the position but that is not the problem (I got great feedback with some helpful pointers and know what points to work on). What happened after was the problem: the guy who got the job was really obnoxious and went around crowing about it to all and sundry and said to a colleague in my hearing that the best man got the job. I’m not sure to this day if he understands why I challenged him on what he said or if he still has the attitude that I’m a hysterical woman.

Supposedly trying to show equality, and about how women make great doctor and are just as good at it as men when I see that this section of writing is in pink.

"I was out to lunch with coworkers today and we were teasing one of them (the only other woman my age who I work with) who is vitamin D deficient and doesn’t like going in the sunshine. We’ve making “you’re a vampire” jokes because of this for a while, but today, when she made a beeline for the shade and a coworker said “yep; vampire”, another coworker said “Aren’t vampires supposed to be hot?” It was out of her earshot, but in mine. He has a history of making these kinds of comments; offensive but probably not worth the HR complaint. He’s made jokes about how all women want to be gang banged, he’s made comments when I have zits (but never when male coworkers do) and he’s made comments about how women in the workplace (and the United States) don’t have it harder than men, they’re just whiny.

"I babysit three children every friday, but I rarely see the older sister, so mostly it’s just two boys.

"The first time was my babysitter’s adopted son. He would feel up my dress while we watched TV and my little 4-year old sister played on the ground in front of us. I was about 8 when it started and he was 14. Since then it’s been date-rape at college, exposures including full-on masturbation and grabbing on the NYC subway, and sexual harassment in the workplace. The man, a senior executive, ended up getting fired, but only after I had filed a formal complaint, been laid off, and he tried the same thing on my boss, who was female. When the Adria Richards scandal happened, I was shocked how many people misunderstand and under-estimate how many women have experienced harassment and abuse. Thank you for making this issue more visible. "
I attended a work meeting with a senior colleague and an external visitor. The senior colleague went out to make the drinks and the visitor leaned over and staged whispered ‘So its your turn to take the notes for him today is it?’ I was shocked as we hadn’t as yet been introduced and he would make these assumptions rather than asking something about me and my role. I replied ‘No I will be the person responsible for delivery if the deal with you is agreed.’ His face was a picture and he was ever so polite after. 
"In meetings I’m not usually addressed, neither in company photos or christmas parties-I wasn’t even invited, I was told its a meeting. The guys at work attend most of the events, they go pub together, abroad together, they only cc each other in emails although it might be something I am suppose to deal with. I am also treated like an idiot. It does upset me a lot and I do feel like crying but not sure what the point is. In my company all the guys are recognised so when I email customers or Clients they assume I’m a guy because they have never met me. I have been in the company for 4 and a half years. "

Where I work they have hired a consultant to help us develop our sales strategy. He’s been interviewing the sales team to get their insights. At the end of his meeting with the only female member of the team he thanked her for her help and said he wished she could be his pa. Funnily enough he didn’t say the same to the male members of the sales team. This casual belittling of our female colleague shocked everyone in the office (male and female) who heard it. I’m still cross about it a week later. And cross at myself for not picking him up on it. 
"Two (female) police officers were walking through a crowded street, in uniform. A guy handing out newspapers to attract new subscribers eyed them up, and tried to hand them a newspaper.

"I work as a park ranger in a team with 5 men. They wouldn’t describe themselves as sexist, probably because they don’t actually sexually harass me, but they are still sexist nonetheless. This job was a career change for me from office work to outdoor work and something I’ve looked forward to and wanted to do for a long time. Unfortunately I don’t really enjoy my job as much as I should because of their attitudes and behaviour. It’s starting to get me down and I find myself withdrawing and feeling like I don’t fit in. When I first started working there I didn’t notice it so much but now I wonder if maybe they were just on good behaviour/being polite until they got an idea whether I’d be the sort of person to challenge/report them. I am regularly interrupted, talked over or unable to even get a word in edge-ways. If I do interrupt in an attempt to make a small contribution I am ticked off for being rude and interrupting – double standard much?! I am often ignored – I’ll start to say something and whoever I’m talking to will stop listening and start checking the football or facebook on their phone. Suggestions I make re jobs to do around the park are usually dismissed. Just today I commented in what I thought was a conversation between 3 of us (me and 2 other men) about the work rota and was told basically that although I was sat right next to them on the lunch table they weren’t talking to me and I should mind my own business. I did wonder if it was just that they’re rude but I should mention that they very very rarely, if ever, do this to each other. They often ogle women who visit the park, and women who work in the cafe in the park and I’m told not to listen if they do it in front of me. If I hear and object then I have no sense of humour or I’m on my period. Just as bad are the horrible and unwarranted comments they make about women who they are not attracted to i.e how fat/ugly they are, what do they think they’re wearing with a figure like that etc. etc. It pisses me off so much, none of them are oil paintings themselves and besides it’s the sheer arrogance of men assuming that everything a woman does/wears etc. must be purely for their benefit and that women somehow need a man’s approval to validate anything they do/say/wear/how they look etc. Apparently I also need a man to validate or invalidate my own feelings as well. I made a comment to one of the team who I thought I got along better with about being nervous having to speak in the larger departmental meetings in front of senior management and was told that was rubbish. “nah, I don’t believe you, you don’t get nervous, you chat to all the volunteers” (yes informally to try and get to know them and get along with everyone!) “so how can you say you get nervous in meetings? Believe me as someone who knows how to read other people’s body language, you’re not nervous” Oh well I’m glad you told me, I had it all wrong. Who the fuck am I to dare to think I might know how I feel?! These are all little things compared to some of the other dreadful experiences I’ve read on here but it’s everyday and it’s starting to wear me down. I’m naturally (I think anyway) a fairly agreeable person and I don’t like conflict, especially at work but I hate feeling like this. If I object, or assert myself it always seems to create an awful atmosphere and I am outnumbered so I’ve started not really saying anything and withdrawing but then I feel as though I’m letting myself down and that makes me more sad and angry. I’ve not really told anyone all of this, I just saw some of the other posts and thought getting it out might help. I’m looking for another job anyway too. "
"I work in a biochem lab and tonight at our Christmas party, I was in a conversation with 3 men. The most senior member of the group (a “distinguished” professor), made an obvious effort to explain to me the terms they were discussing, even though I am at the same education level and in the same field. We focus on women’s health. I tried to give input on my own research, but everything was met with “well I know that already.” Once the other men left the conversation, he turned to go without even saying goodbye to me. I feel completely disrespected. "
"A male manager dressed up as Santa and invited the “girls” to come and sit on his knee with a hearty chuckle. Then gifts were distributed: alcohol for the men, soap for the women. I gave mine back because I was offended that a year’s worth of hard work amounted to two cheap soaps while the men were given beer or whiskey and treated like kings, but I was made to feel as though I was overreacting and too emotional. "
"So, I started a new job. Most of the Guy’s I now work with are 40-65 years old. Most of the women af in their 20s. I haven’t heard ‘banter’ like it for years. Guy: I don’t want to blow my own trumpet’. Other guy ‘why would you, #### could do that for you’. "
"You know, it is chauvinist men like you that make women so emotional. Maybe, just maybe, YOU are the one who is flawed. But you are too damned self-absorbed and gender discriminatory to ever think that there is some flaw in the sculptured image you have made yourself into. And maybe if you STOPPED using the opposite sex as nothing more than a figure, something to blame, something to mistreat, and something to abuse, you could stop making yourself into such a vexing sexist pig. And, maybe, if you could take a look outside of yourself and not give a name to a large group of peoples, you could learn something. Oh and also, have you taken sex ed? Because last time I checked,YOU would not BE here without a woman. And also, you are making YOURSELF look stupid and unenlightened to the human species when you even ask this question. So I’ll answer your question with one of my own: Why are YOU so annoying? Go fall in a ditch. "
"The first time I consciously experienced sexism I was 15. There was construction being done on the road I lived on, right where the school bus dropped me off. One day I was wearing a mid-length skirt and when the bus pulled away and I walked towards my home one of the workers started cat-calling. Lots of whistling and words that I couldn’t quite make out, didn’t want to. I suppose he saw the plaid pattern on my skirt and his mind immediately went to school girl pornography. He followed me for a few steps. I was terrified that he would follow me home, where I would be alone, and rape me. I locked all the doors and hid in my bedroom until my parents came home. I never told them what happened, I was afraid they would tell me it was my fault. But I stayed after school to be picked up until construction was finished. I wondered if he had done that to other young girls – to other children, because that’s what I was. I believed he had. I wondered if his co-workers ever told him off or reported him to their superiors, and had a strange suspicion that no one ever had. Since then I have experienced sexism in many, many ways. From my uncle when I was 16 or 17, slapping me on the ass at Thanksgiving and dismissively ordering me to get him “a cup of coffee, sweetheart.” This time I did tell my parents, and my father had a few well-chosen words for him. But first I got him that cup of coffee. From my grandparents, who told me for my entire life to sit with my legs closed because it isn’t “lady-like”. All the while my male cousins were allowed to take up as much space as they needed and more. From men who blatantly hit on me, sometimes right in front of my husband, treating me like an object that is meant to be conquered if they just try hard enough, if they just pretend to be my friend for long enough. From those same men who now completely ignore me because I stopped shaving my legs and armpits (the best decision of my entire fucking life). To them, my worth as a person directly relates to my attractiveness and whether or not they would fuck me. From the strange men on street corners who whistle and scream at me as I walk by, who sometimes follow me when I ignore them. Forcing me to cross the street the next time I see them, but they whistle and scream all the same and I have to avoid the streets they inhabit altogether. From other women, who think they need to compete with me and belittle me in order to prove their own worth. Women who believe that tearing their sisters down is the only way to make it in this world designed for men. Even sadder, the women who do it without even knowing why. From my own blood-sister, who makes fun of women who wear high heels, who have blonde hair, who dress provocatively (all things that I have done or been at some point in my life). Who thinks she is superior to women who can’t carry a 20lb bag of animal feed like she can. Who thinks things that are girly and feminine are stupid, yet her daughter’s wardrobe is made up of mostly pink, and all her toys are pink because how else would she be able to tell them apart from her brother’s toys? To my former male boss and male co-workers, who stood around trying to guess my age while I cleared tables, sat customers, swept, mopped, stocked the buffet, prepped desserts, rolled silverware. To the same boss who docked my hours because I was deemed to distracting to the male chef, who incessantly hit on me despite my insistent requests for him to stop. From strange men in stores who tell me to smile, yes, they tell me to the same as if they were ordering a dog to sit. As if telling someone to smile is the sole way to make a person smile. As if a man being in my presence is a viable reason to smile, despite how I may actually be feeling. Perhaps I just got into an argument with a friend. It’s possible someone I love just died. Maybe I’m clinically depressed and today I don’t want to smile, I just want to get my shopping done and go home. Smile? Fuck you! Leave me alone! I’m just trying to shop for groceries, what the fuck is there to smile about?! From the magazines geared towards women displayed in check-out lines, telling me how to get thinner and prettier to attract men. Claiming to know the food that will cure my hypothyroidism forever AND reduce that embarrassing belly fat. Offering fun little quizzes that will tell me who my perfect man is, or what dress to wear, or what hairstyle I should try. The magazines that never tell women they can be more than what they look like, the magazines with impossible standards of beauty, the magazines with sex tips written by men and articles about how not to sound bossy that are written by men, magazines created by men. From everyone and their great grandmother telling all the women of the world – your skirt is too short / your skirt is too long. That’s too much make-up / you should wear more make-up. You’re too loud and bossy / why do you let everyone walk all over you? You’re such a tomboy, people will mistake you for a lesbian / don’t you know high heels are really bad for your feet? You’ll never find a man if you don’t go out / if you hadn’t of gone out to that place you wouldn’t have gotten raped. I could go on and on and on and on… "
"Started in a new workplace. First day. Sign over the sink, “Your momma doesn’t work here. Do your own dishes.” Nice picture of 1950’s housewife to accompany. Ugh… "
"When I was 15 two older boys gave me alcohol and took it in turns to rape me then told everyone at school and college I had consented and boasted that money had changed hands, that they had pumped me out to eachother. They since tried to introduce me to other men under the same circumstances, but knowing what would follow, I fled. I was at uni a few years later when I told a guy *no* and he paid no attention. I have been in numerous night clubs where I have been groped, fondled, and shouted at by complete strangers. I have had sexual expletives yelled out of cars at me. I was sexually assaulted when working as a care worker, and currently on my welding course one man thinks it’s ok to talk about my vagina repeatedly. Being a woman is a hard job and we are viewed as the “weaker” sex. I don’t think so. "
I’m here again. Someone was talking about the intelligence of a female partner. Our Managing Director just yelled “{woman’s name} used to be hot until she had kids”. It wasn’t relevant – we weren’t discussing her hotness. It wasn’t fair – you’re a fat arsehole who didn’t have to carry and push out two children. 
"When the women at my workplace need to take a personal day or collect their children from school, it’s ‘frustrating kid stuff’. When the men at my workplace need to do the same, it’s ‘babysitting’. Newsflash. You’re not 14. It’s not babysitting, it’s parenting. "
"I work at sea, as a deck officer on oil tankers, which is a very male-dominated industry. I am almost always the only female onboard. Also a very difficult career to have if you have a family as it means working on a ship, away from home for months at a time. Currently there is a junior officer onboard, who I have the role of mentoring and supporting until he is ready to take on my job. On the first day of working with him he mentioned that one of our colleagues, who is the same age as me (22) is getting married next year. He then went on to ask when I was getting married. I told him that I had no plans to get married anytime soon and would rather wait a few years, maybe when I’m 29, we’ll see. He then very assertively told me “That’s too late! You should get married when you’re 25 and within one or two years start having children.” When I then said that I wasn’t sure I even wanted to have children, he was appalled and said “But you have to have children!” and went on to tell me that every woman wanted to have children and that I wasn’t normal. What makes this guy think he can tell me what to do with me life, especially as we just met and he knows absolutely nothing about me?! And why, in 2016, is it still assumed by so many that getting married and having children is the number one priority for all women? "
I work in a very male dominated office. There are hardly any women and women do not rise up. The management have a ‘boys club’ and the female managers are excluded. There has been a cull of staff recently and they are all women who have been let go including the female managers. They roll their eyes whenever they are confronted and say ‘women’. They like people who keep their head down and don’t make a fuss. They make out that women are too overly emotional and when we try to complain it makes it worse. In my job previously my male manager said he only employed women because they didn’t threaten his job. He employed women for looks and tried to sleep with them and succeeded on occasion. Women felt they needed to sleep with the boss to move up the ladder. Both being ignored and ridiculed in my current job and untoward treatment in my last job is wrong. 
"The message “You are enough” when directed at women is incredibly sexist because it encourages mediocrity. If you think that you are “enough” then you won’t have the motivation to improve yourself or learn new things. Women’s “self esteem” programs just seem to encourage stagnation. How exactly is gazing in the mirror and calling yourself “awesome” or “beautiful” supposed to help you learn how to do new technical tasks in the real world? (Hint it doesn’t) It just makes you a smug, deluded and arrogant mirror gazer. Are men ever told that they are “enough” as part of “empowerment programs”? Heck no! Men often have to strive and work hard to meet other people’s expectations at the gym or at work. A lot of them don’t have the leisure to slack off because society encourages men to improve themselves and compete with each other. Men are given the message that self improvement is a constant process that never ends. Men are judged on how fat they are too. Are they told by society that they are enough or that they are “beautiful as they are”? Nope! They are told that they are fat men with beer bellies that need to exercise. The reason why some men do incredibly well is because they are told to strive for success from the moment they are born. Girls in contrast are usually just given a vanity mirror and a brush and told that they are “beautiful princesses”. Boys are told that they have to “save the princess”: they are told that becoming a prince is a process that takes hard work, problem solving and effort. Girls are told that sitting about and looking pretty is “enough” to be a princess. This is why I am particularly irritated by well meaning nice women telling me that I am “enough” as a woman. One time I was trying to explain to a work colleague that I was dissatisfied with my Mathematical abilities. She said that I was “good enough” and “knew a lot”. I basically said that if I was really “good enough” I would have got an A at A Level Maths and not a B. I said that I was dissatisfied with my result because I had gaps in my knowledge and couldn’t remember how to use all of the formulae and procedures. I said that I was trying to rectify this by trying to study on my own. (I basically had to try and learn on my own how to do t-tests, Chi Squared and F Statistics tests in Excel by using a Maths themed Japanese Comic book). Yep, my old school did not teach me how to do Statistics in Excel (despite promising to teach me and others “Key Skills” in information technology). “Investor in people” and encouraging young people to “fulfil their potential”? What a sick joke! Anyway, nobody truly “fulfils their potential” because improvement is a constant process with no end, so that phrase is just a load of silly rubbish. Funny how all of those Japanese Maths Mangas I read now have characters talking about the value of hard work and persistence in problem solving. The concepts of “self esteem” and “you are enough” are not even mentioned at all. The message “You have to strive to succeed” is mentioned throughout. That goes for both genders! I just wish that more girls and women could be taught this instead on the limiting phrase “You are enough”. Men are told they have no limits because society never tells them that they are enough! Men are never told to rest on their laurels. Men are told that great mathematicians were men that worked hard and strived constantly improving. Oh yeah and teach girls/women how to use Statistical tests and advanced functions in Excel instead of staring in a mirror saying “I am beautiful and good enough”. You know, learning how to do processes in Excel might just help them in STEM. Just sayin’. "
"Sometimes I really wish that I was a man. If I was a man, people wouldn’t be trying to “empower” me all the time: they’d expect me to put the effort in to succeed instead. If I were a man, people wouldn’t try and sugar coat reality by telling me “empowering messages” that I am “enough” or “worthy”, instead they would tell me exactly when I made a mistake and expect me to correct it. They would tell me that it order to be “worthy” of anything, I’d need to work for it. They wouldn’t try to pander to my vanity by telling me that I am “beautiful” and “perfect as I am”, they would tell me to exercise if I was fat and learn how to do Maths if I was struggling. Men are treated like adults in our culture. Men are viewed as dynamic works in progress. Women are infantilised in our culture by being called “girls”. They are told that by so called “girls empowerment programs” (notice it’s never women power programs) that they are “worthy” of success by being “perfect as they are”. This attitude does not encourage improvement or learning new things: it encourages passivity. Hmmm… The truth is that nobody is perfect! Men know this only too well and it is the reason why many of them strive to be better all the time, not just being satisfied with who they are right now. Ever heard of Boy’s empowerment workshops? Me neither! This is because boys are told to try hard and persist at tasks from the moment they are born. Men are told that their worth comes from what they do. Men have to prove their worth to the world. Many girls’ aren’t given this same encouragement to master real practical world tasks, but instead are told to “value” themselves for no tangible reason at all. How sexist is that? Lots of girls’ empowerment workshops just seem to consist of a bunch of women telling some girls to look in the mirror and call themselves “beautiful” and “worthy”. There is no real work or brainpower involved in this: just a lot of airy fairy platitudes that doesn’t help anyone in the real world or accomplish anything concrete. The truth is that your worthiness is judged by other people, not you. For example, I could theoretically say to my Maths teacher that I am “worthy” of a grade A because I “am perfect as I am”. She would probably laugh in my face and say: “You have to prove that you are worthy of an A grade by getting above 80% on this assignment.” You can’t beg for grades, you have to work hard to earn them, but even working hard may not guarantee an A grade. You could believe that you are “perfect” and “worthy” for the lead female part in the school play. Doing the Maths here, say 30 girls turned up to audition for the part. So this means that 29 other girls could potentially get the part. Just going on probability alone 1/30 chance that you get the part (assuming all performances had an equal chance of meeting the standard) these are slim odds just based on numbers. Reality is often messier than this though. Some girls may do terrible auditions and some may do fantastic ones. I this scenario, believing that you are “worthy” for a part in the school play isn’t the only factor that determines if you get the part. The drama teachers’ personalities and preferences may determine how they judge you. If one teacher didn’t like you that much at all as a person, then this would mean that you would be much less likely to get a part in the play. Saying that your worthy doesn’t seem to be enough, other people have to accept who you are too. There are many actresses with “low self esteem” who get lead part after lead part because other people like them! So no, you sometimes don’t even think that you have to be “worthy” to get the starring role! The whole female “worthiness” and “self esteem” “empowerment” philosophy does seem to crumble under close scrutiny. If I was indeed “perfect as I am” or “worthy” as these “girl empowerment platitudes” claim, then why do I receive so many complaints from other people about my mistakes at work, my blunders at school and my ugliness? If I was really that perfectly beautiful, then I would not get the complaints from my family that I am fat, ugly or spotty. If I was truly worthy of praise and success then I would succeed a lot more often than I am doing now and would get a heck of a lot more praise! If I was truly “worthy of love” as these female affirmations claim, then I would not be single right now. Men wouldn’t leave me for younger women or make negative comments about my looks. This sadly is not reality. I could believe all kinds of ego inflating platitudes, but other people may still reject me, not offer me opportunities or not like me all that much. People aren’t really worthy of anything, but people judge each other and self esteem guarantees nothing. So please, I would like people to stop trying to “empower” me as a “perfect little girl” and instead treat me like the imperfect adult woman that I am. Every time anyone called me “beautiful” or “talented” they always went back on their words later and rejected me. Flattery is basically lies to sugar coat reality and take advantage of people. All of this “you are worthy because you are a woman and you are perfect as you are” is rubbish that’s worth about as much as a bucket of excrement. I might just as well say: “I am worthy because I am a raccoon with three legs, give me a grade A for showing up!” It would probably make just as much sense. Yet this kind of silly “empowerment” rubbish gets trotted out as part of mental health support groups or girls empowerment workshops. How about instead of running girls’ empowerment workshops, we run real workshops that give females access to real power tools? That way women/girls could actually learn about real work in a workshop! Power tools like drills, science equipment or computers. You know, like the sort of tools that boys and men have been encouraged to use for decades? How about instead of teaching self esteem, these workshops taught real self efficacy? It really ticks me off no end that people think I am depressed as a woman because I supposedly have “low self esteem”. The reality is that I get depressed when people hate me, I don’t know how to do a technical procedure or the technical equipment breaks down. Fix any one of these problems and I am immediately a lot happier! It is bizarre that people think that as a woman I have to stare in a mirror and declare that I “love myself completely” in order to be happy! Lots of fun things, such as playing video games or helping out other people don’t require mirror gazing at all! Somebody connected with some kind of mental health group asked me what I saw in the mirror. I said that I saw the reflection of light beams bouncing off of the reflective glass surface. He got angry at my truthful answer and asked me how attractive I thought I was. I said that I honestly wasn’t that good looking. He grew furious. I told him why and basically said that other people had complained to me about my looks in the past and I was just taking their opinions on board. He said that I should like how I look. I said that I did not like how I looked because I was kind of ugly looking and fat because I had let myself slide due to my being too lazy to exercise. He grew furious and said that I should love myself and think I was beautiful as I am. I said that he was talking rubbish because well everyone’s a bit ugly anyway and I was just more ugly than most. What on earth is wrong with admitting as a woman that you are somewhat ugly or even average looking? Is this a crime? Oh bizarre twist of fate, I have been bullied by mental health professionals and peers for not thinking that “perfectly beautiful as I am”. Seriously what the heck?! What is so wrong with admitting to being ugly or average looking anyway? Why do people want me to lie to myself as a woman and sugar coat reality? "
When I was 14 I was sexually assaulted at a house party after having my drink spiked- no one believed me and I was punished for underage drinking. When I was 15 & 16 I was routinely cat called at by builders who where doing an extension on my neighbours house – I was just told to ignore them When I was 18 I was physically grabbed between my legs by a male co worker who was ” just making a joke” When I was 20 I made a complaint about an older colleagues inappropriate behaviour towards me – he was 30 years my senior and he made my life hell after finding out I complained and I had to quit. When I was 27 I was stalked harassed and threatened by a man I dated and dumped because I could see he was quite violent after 4 weeks together and after blocking him on all my social media and his phone number police told me they couldn’t do much than “have a word with him” because there wasn’t enough evidence to suggest he’d harm me …. dispite 4 days worth of texts emails and voicemails of abuse. Oh and I forgot one….when I was 21 my two male employers asked me if I had a vibrator….. 
"A few weeks ago I walked away from the counter at work because a middle-aged, male customer wouldn’t stop staring at me. Today I walked past the customer service desk and one of the guys in line was staring at me. He was closer to my age, but obviously it was still inappropriate. I scowled at him but it didn’t deter him; in fact, he was smiling creepily. I walked out of his sight and stayed away until he was gone. I really wish I knew what men want from women they harass (besides sex, obviously). Do they leer for attention? Was that pathetic loser happy that I gave him the attention I did? I want to find out what they want and give them the exact opposite. "
"75 y.o male colleague seems to enjoy baiting me with daily comments such as ‘well, biologically men are stronger than women, you know’, ‘I don’t want to sit around with a bunch of birds teetering around in their high heels’, ‘I work with 2 women, I know my place’, ‘that woman over there who goes after what she wants, she’s a bitch’, ‘thanks sweetheart’, ‘that customer won’t talk to you directly because in his eyes you’re a young girl’… and the list goes on, and on. I politely asked him to stop interrupting me when explaining a work process to him. He physically stood over me, wagged his finger in my face and told me in a hostile tone ‘You’re not my boss. Don’t you talk to me like I’m a little schoolboy.’ When all I did was courteously assert a professional boundary. Most recently I pointed out that certain words and dismissive/reductive remarks made based on a person’s gender is considered sexist, his response? ‘Well, that’s your interpretation’. Finally, when trying to get to get clarity around a task he was asking me to do on behalf of our boss, he lost his shit by getting angry and spat out ‘I’m sick of you making such a big production out of everything!’. Gee, I was just asking questions. He really shouldn’t worry his pretty little head about it. "
"As a super geek, I love everything comics, movies, video game, etc. And so imagine how happy I was when I got a full time job at a comic book shop in the mall! I had access and was allowed to borrow books and trade paperbacks. I was so happy and I loved my job, and would still go back to a similar job, but I did encounter sexism in the workplace. I had one customer try to show me up in my favorite series (Iron Man) as if I didn’t know anything because I was a girl. Instead I showed him up and outright told him he was wrong. I helped one customer, then went to pick up some lunch for my manager and I. This customer thought it was okay to hunt me down and follow me through the mall for fifteen minutes. I’m rather shy when it comes to come-ons, and so back then I didn’t know how to react and said I had a boyfriend. I was currently dating but not in a relationship with my partner at that point so I felt it was okay that it wasn’t a full out lie. I should have just blatantly told him that it wasn’t okay for him to follow me, and if he was actually interested he should have just tried it in the store so I could just let him down nicely (I’m not saying it’s bad to hit on a woman; I actually met the man I love in the comic shop as we flirted over the music I was playing). Hunting a girl down in a mall is just desperate and creepy. One gentleman, a returning customer, once gave me his Facebook (his phone had been turned off because he didn’t pay the bill, charming!) telling me to contact him, obviously for reasons other than friendship. He was pushing his four week old baby in a carriage, and his wife- who I had more conversations with- was in the store next door. Again I didn’t know how to respond, so I laughed out it with my manager because it was just to desperate and stupid, and threw the paper away. I wish his wife had come in, I honestly would have told her. After a while I bought a cheap ring that looked vaguely engagement-y and began wearing it when I got tired of the obvious come ons. It’s depressing that I had to do this just to cut down the approaches. Oh and did I mention that the owner blatantly admit that he hates hiring women? Yeah, I tripled his sales and he fired me because “it’s not working out.” "
"A male client who regularly visits the office to chat with anyone who has the time & inclination, engages with me in a spirited conversation. His phone rings a couple of times and he ignores it. After some time I gracefully disengage and get back to work. My male colleague later quips ‘yeah, his wife was wondering what was holding him up’. "
"I make the stand that I won’t work with a male sexist, hostile colleague anymore. I’ve reached my limit & I’m departing the company. I’m immediately offered the ‘gift’ of 2 weeks leave with pay for all the hard work I’ve done recently. Guess my boss thinks I need a Bex & lay down. The real tragedy? She’s a woman. "
I’m a naturally engaging person and a talented negotiator. Not a flirt. Not a man-eater. Not a bitch. Not an emotional manipulator. I’m smart and successful. And I’m a woman. 
"Im a man, i experience sexist comments from women every day. They usually say “could you move this heavy item because you are a man” and “Hello handsome (this usually includes a inapropriate touch on my shoulder or bottom)”. All this makes me very unconfortable and being in a job that has more women than men (im a nurse) i feel very powerless. "
"Even though I am only 22, I feel like I experienced a lot of sexism and sexual harassment. These are some out of many events: – 16 years old at my male friend’s house: he invited few other people, one of the guys was very nice and flirty with me. When I went to toilet to pee and call my friend, he came in and tried to grab my boobs and ass and kiss me. I pushed him away and then he pushed me back so hard I fell into a bathtub and then he threw a hairbrush at me. When I came back to the living room, I was so shocked I didn’t know what to do and this asshole started to rap about ‘stupid bitches’ and then he pointed at me slagging me off in his song. Later on, I told my male friend what happened and he just said ‘oh really? Yeah, he can be a little crazy sometimes’….wow. -My BMI and my body is completely fine. I would look better if I lost 10 pounds, but who wouldn’t? My father feels different though, he always comments on me being fat and how men don’t like fat women. When I tell him he is fat himself (he has a beer belly ffs, I don’t!) he says that he’s a man and he’s allowed to look like that. He also told me that all men cheat on their women, because it’s their nature and women should just stop questioning biology but if women cheat they’re cheap wh*res. He also refers to women as ‘stupid c*nts’ and he only pays attention to women who he considers attractive. Average looking women make him irritated and unattractive women make him actually angry. His disgusting attitude makes me sick, I’m embarrassed to have a father like him. -I live in a city where whistling at women got banned by police forces, basically a woman can report a man who whistles at her. When the articles about it appeared online, the comments were horrifying. Men were outraged, they were calling women names and they were asking ‘how am I supposed to flirt with a woman?’ or ‘this is an attack on man-woman dynamics’ etc. Where I worked at the time, men were saying the same things. I argued with them and they ‘allowed me’ to argue with them only because I was younger and considered attractive otherwise I would be called a stupid cow behind my back. They found my argument ‘adorable’ and they claimed that whistling at older, less attractive women makes their day, because they feel attractive once again. -The same office: a young girl got hired on the upper floor and old office farts started commenting how juicy she is. After many inappropriate comments, they finally realized that I am listening to them but instead of realizing how nasty this is, they said ‘but we have our own sexy lady here’. Oh wow, cheers. -Different office: my boyfriend told me that in this one private company, the sleazy boss was only hiring 18-25 year old attractive women (or girls actually!) as his administration team. He had only one unattractive woman as his accountant, because he actually didn’t believe an attractive woman can be trusted with his taxes! I was desperate to get a job at the time so my boyfriend’s colleague told me if I wear a tight dress and some heels I might get it. F*ck that. There are many jobs like casino babes where lots of sexism happens and although I am repulsed, I can understand that old, rich men want to gamble surrounded by attractive women – costumer demand makes the market going. However, neutral jobs like offices should not be a beauty pageant. – Only 2 weeks ago, I went out with my friends and it happened to be only few men. Whenever I was on my own for like few minutes, the following happened: a creepy guy told me to smile more and was walking behind me until I found my friends, a group of guys blocked my way from the toilet and started chatting to me, they were friendly but I didn’t like how they blocked me and forced me to have a conversation starting with ‘I have a girlfriend, but these two lads are single and they are…’ so that wasn’t even a friendly chat, it was already stated that I am supposed to talk to only single guys until one of them give me enough space to come back to my friends. Later on, I was looking for one of my friends and two old guys grabbed me by my hand and one of them tried to kiss me on the face. All of these happened in a gay bar, where women like me go in order to not get hit on by nasty guys. -During my second year of university, I lived 3 minutes away from my boyfriend’s house, however the only way to get there was though the alley way. I was ok walking there until 6pm, after that I’ve been catcalled and hit on by strange men. When I started asking my boyfriend to come and get me, our female friend called me ‘high maintained’ and I had a feeling that people think I’m some kind of princess, because I am too scared to walk through the dark alleyway. Besides, the fact that I actually had to have a guy next to me every time, because otherwise I’d get verbal sexual abuse form strangers, makes my blood boil! -I got roofied in the club, and luckily my female friends realized what happened to me and I ended up waking up in my bedroom, not remembering anything with the hospital band on my hand. My boyfriend (the same shitty boyfriend form other stories) didn’t go and see me when I told him what happened even though he lived 3 minutes away from me. Not only half of the people told me that this is my fault, because I wasn’t responsible enough (I got this drink from the bar!) but also my cousin defended my shitty boyfriend saying that maybe he thinks another guy bought it. Even if it was true, if the roles were reversed I wouldn’t give a damn where he got it from, I’d be just worried if he’s ok! Can’t believe that I actually got criticized for being roofied. -I was once walking towards my college, near main street at around 8am. Suddenly, I had this instant urge to turn around and thanks God I did, because I saw this guy with his hands raised towards me as he was just about to grab me by the neck. I quickly moved back, shocked and he ran to the alleyway, which was next to us so I assume he wanted to grab me by the neck and drag me there…I was trembling for the rest of the day. -Countless times guys whistled at me, catcalled me, stalked me, grabbed my boobs, my ass, my hand without permission…at some point, my mum said that I attract weirdos and I should only transport by bus or taxi, never walk anywhere. So basically I should move around only by bus or taxi or next to a man (damn, better find another shitty boyfriend then) and if I get attacked, it’s probably my fault anyway, because I wasn’t being responsible enough. Nevertheless, I really loved the ted talk with Laura. It’s sad that other women experience as much or even more sexism as I do, but I also feel that websites like that can empower us and motivate us to bring some social changes. Next time, I will tell the weirdo in a bus to piss of or I’ll report him, and I’ll call out guys on being sexist. "
"Before I begin, I want to point out that so many women here feel the need to mention what they were wearing when they’ve been harassed. I want them to know: IT DOESN’T MATTER. What you wear doesn’t matter! We should be able to walk through this life dressing in whatever way we feel comfortable without risking our safety or being objectified. Needless to say, whether you wear a short skirt or a long one, men will harass you anyway. Sexual harassment happens so much in a woman’s lifetime â€“Â it would be impossible for all of us to remember every single incident. These are just the ones that stand out in my memory the most. — When I was a teenager, I babysat frequently for a family in my neighborhood. Though I only lived down the street in a very safe suburban area, the children’s father never let me walk home. Instead, he’d insist on driving me â€“Â reaching around me from the driver’s seat to buckle my seatbelt for me. He’d also often comment on my body â€“Â my chest, in particular. He made me feel violated, vulnerable and unsafe. Walking down the street in Seattle, a man shouted at me, “Girl â€“ you could be a in a porno.” I felt embarrassed and degraded. In a packed subway, a man who was sitting across the car from me started yelling obscenities at me â€“Â making comments about my body and appearance. When I didn’t acknowledge him, he started calling me a bitch and a whore. Nobody said or did anything to defend me. I felt humiliated and scared. I had a really early flight and was walking to the subway in the dark. A man said, “Hey beautiful.” We were the only two on the whole block. I didn’t respond. He said, “I’m just being friendly.” How could I possibly trust that? At a party a few months ago, I said no. I went to a different room, but he followed me. I said I was tired, I said I wanted to go to sleep. I did not consent. He didn’t listen. I keep blaming myself for what happened, trying to take control of a situation in which I felt powerless. It’s easier if I think I had control. It’s not a problem if I think I wanted it. But my heart knows the truth: I didn’t want it. I said no. I’ve been seeing a therapist for several weeks now. She’s helping me to slowly cope. I am not ready to call it the “R” word yet, but the intellectual side of my mind knows that’s what it was. I just can’t accept it yet. While I always had a heightened awareness of my surroundings because of previous experiences, like the ones described above, I now feel especially jumpy and on edge. I am afraid to be in certain social situations. I have avoided seeing friends because the emotional weight of this is too heavy sometimes and it’s easier to hide at home. I’ve avoided speaking to my parents as much as possible, because I know that I might blurt it out before I’m ready to share. I think I may be depressed. I wish he had just left me alone. "
I recently worked in a restaurant/hotel as part of a school trip to Spain. My friend and I were the only females working in this place so the old guys got a bit too interested; when we told our supervisor that they kept looking down our tops and trying to flirt with us he said that there was nothing he could do because it was normal and we just had to ignore them. 
"I have a few stories to report. Firstly, my friends vagina was grabbed by an older boy in a school corridor and she was too embarrassed to report it, she was 15 at the time. I work in a restaurant and a sexual comment was made about me as I leant slightly over a male customer to give them their meal. My bum was slapped by a customer in work. I have been cat called on the street and made to feel embarrassed in dresses and skirts. On the way home from school when I was 16 two employees from ‘amberon’ were sat in a van cat calling out the window. When I didn’t reply they drove the van in front of me and I had to awkwardly walk around it. As I get older, (I am now 18) these incidents happen more frequently. When talking to boys my age they say that it is harmless flirting and there is no meaning behind it. "
"This was a couple of years back. I had just entered a meeting room with five coworkers. I leaned across the table to pull the phone to the center, and a female coworker loudly exclaimed, “nice buns!” Extremely embarrassing. I could think of nothing to say and just turned red. What does one do with that sort of thing? "
"I work for a fortune 500 company, when I asked why I wasn’t invited to our meeting for the end of night, I was told it was because I didn’t have a beard. "
"When your male boss talks about a new account manager at work by telling you, “it’s about time we had someone pretty working here.” "
"He said “come over here, I want to talk to you about something”. My first thought was “well, why don’t you move instead of make me come over”…. I knew this guy, in the two weeks since starting work there, he was among the creepiest of the guys (sadly, there were many). I get it, Latin America has different norms when it comes to seduction/staring at people that are attractive. But every woman knows the difference between being stared at by the guy who thinks you’re attractive and wants to talk to you, and the guy who doesn’t even seem to consider you like a human being. You immediately feel uncomfortable, and you know his head is filled with revolting dehumanising things he wishes he could do to you. But I go over. “Yes?” He takes me by the arm and pulls me past the corner, then grabs my face with both hands and shoves his tongue at my mouth. Although he did not initially take no for an answer, the space was public enough that I had no difficulty in getting away. The worst part is, I felt slightly bad about rejecting so directly. This was my workplace, and these were the kind of guys I had to work with everyday. And that incident in that context hardly even felt noteworthy. I wonder if I will ever stop being so brainwashed and tolerant of the everyday sexism. "
"I was a young adult and working at a job in the NHS as a healthcare assistant. I went on a night out with staff (but didn’t drink myself) and had my boss get very drunk and ultimately grab my body, turn me to face other male employees and say ‘check these out (my breasts)’, after commenting on them all night to others. I was mortified but he never mentioned or addressed it – my female colleagues also played it down after the event, and one would ultimately start to retell the story to paint me in a more negative light. By telling this story I was seen as challenging the team spirit I think, even though I never put in a formal complaint (I now wish I had) and very rarely mentioned it. I would definitely do things differently now, but at the time I was aware that my colleagues would have most likely sided with my boss as part of an ‘all in it together/it’s just banter’ culture, which would have made keeping my job very difficult. "
"I went to a job interview, and right at the end the guy asked ” so what do you want in the future, a family? A career? Maybe both?” "
"One day I was at work and my colleague who is a middle aged man with at least 2 kids younger than myself asked for a hug like he quite often does. He can grabbed my behind and wouldn’t let go for about 5-7 seconds, I was unable to escape as he was a lot taller and stronger than I am. This happened about a year ago and I never reported him and he still asks for hugs to this day. "
"I used to work in FE, in a customer service/admin-type role. One of the duties was assisting members of the public and/or enrolled students, who would drop in with enquiries. Another task of the department was to assess applicants’ levels of literacy and numeracy. Certain staff had much more interaction with the public front-line than others (who would be in a side office doing admin, or, lets be realistic,skiving). Over time, I became increasingly aware of some front line staff (usually male, but not exclusively) calling male colleagues from the side office area to come and deal with an ‘assessment’. I found this strange as it was not part of their duties to cover the assessments, but thought nothing more of it. Then, at a Christmas team lunch, one of the team had compiled a ‘fun’ quiz about the team/college. One of the questions was “what does assessment mean?”. I was shocked to learn that it was a code word used to call male staff to the public area, to gawp at / ogle younger female students & members of the public (who were deemed to be ‘fit’ or ‘hot’). Apparently this was an open secret and had gone on for some time. There were line managers and departmental managers (male and female) present at the lunch. No official action was taken! I tried to raise it, but was told I didn’t have any written proof and therefore that I was putting in false complaints against male colleagues. In addition, the ID numbers of ‘fit’ female students were emailed around male staff every so often, so they could check out the online ID photos and timetables, to see when the student/s were due in college. Certain male staff would then hang around the entrance to try and see the student arrive or leave. And all this took place in a publicly-funded FE college, supposedly a place of equality, learning and improving the mind. Shocking! "
When I left my job my boss hired two men to takeover my workload and paid one of the men more than I had been paid despite doing only 50% of the work 
"I work part time in a factory operating a printer. The work is shared between me and another guy. An older man at the plant asks me to print a job in a file format I’ve never printed before. After my first failed attempt still in sort of a trial phase because they have never asked me to do this job before, he comes back and asks me if it worked. I explain to him that this printer isn’t responding and I will try one of the other ones. His immediate response is “isn’t there a GUY here who can do this job? Where’s ___? Is he better at this than you are? We usually have a GUY that does this job at my other workplace” I was floored by the blatant accusation that because I am a woman I must therefore not understand how to use a computer or know how to operate machinery.

"Im lucky enough to have a very educated strong and aware girlfriend (8years). I see what happens in the world and it makes me angry to see. people need to stand up, speak loud and educate people. I have a few female friends, who will sing infront of huge audiences, have doctorates, play rugby, and all of them have at one time been in abusive relationship and their strength and life seems to desert them infront of a smaller obstacle than they have faced in their life! I cant understand people not being able to speak up or being ashamed even if it means losing a job etc, its not in me to keep my mouth shut and it shouldnt be in anyone, however i do get to hide behind my 250 pound exterior. A study among 10 close friends, all male, including family lawyers, fathers, councillors ~ all in relationships, and not crude enough to catcall or abuse women in the street or the workplace (scince school at least*). yet the first thing they think when they see/meet an attractive woman (consensus) is what does she look like naked, and how does she f**k. Maybe girls should be told that for some of them , 90% of men they meet will imagine, want or try to have sex with them. In public people/men will rarely admit to this, however that goes for many things. Test you husband or partner out…. "
"Worked part time as a student at a supermarket on the clothing and homeware range. I had to deal with all sorts of sexism from men who thought it was appropriate to bother someone at work. It ranged from men leering at my arse while I was picking up clothes off the floor, to disgusting sexual comments. Usually it came from older men, men that were old enough to have daughters and wives (although that shouldn’t be the only reason that would make them think twice about commenting). Most of the time it didn’t bother me too much, as it was from a distance and they never really persisted past a comment. However, one of the worst situations was when a man, about my age (20-ish) literally chased me down and grabbed me when I was on my way to the staffroom for my break. He then angrily asked me ‘Do you sell bells?’ to which I said ‘no sorry’ and walked away as fast as I could as he glared at me. He then returned later that day, with his mother in tow. I tried as hard as I could to avoid him again, but he managed to get hold of me when I was distracted. All seemed normal as mother and son asked about the duvet cover range. I was then asked to reach for a duvet cover on the top shelf. I went away to grab a step stool, and when I came back the man was holding two pairs of mens underwear, and proceeded to ask me ‘I’ve got a small sized waist, but medium sized genitals, which underwear would you say would be more comfortable for my junk?’ He made groping hand movements around his genital area while he was speaking. His mother, who I was expecting to tell him off after that, didn’t bat an eyelid. I hardly made an excuse and walked off as quickly as possible. His body language the whole time was really sexual, trying to move as close to me as possible, and at one point put his arm around me. It probably doesn’t sound that bad, and I’m far from a prude, but I suffer from social anxiety. I’m generally really uncomfortable around men I don’t know properly (history of abuse) and I very much value personal space. I felt sick and creeped out the whole day, and complained to the security guard who was actually very understanding and offered to ban the guy from the store, but we couldn’t find him afterwards. "
"Earlier this year I went to the supermarket and picked up two bottles of my favourite wine that were on special offer, along with some regular groceries. I went through the self-service checkout and when the male assistant came over and checked my ID he whispered to me in a condescending tone “Shouldn’t drink too much of that stuff, little lady. You’ll ruin your looks.” Supermarket staff should not be making comments like that to anyone, but what made it worse was that there were lone male customers behind me going through the checkouts with multiple crates full of beer to whom he made no such snide remarks. He singled me out because of my gender. I complained to the store management about the comment this man had made to me and how inappropriate it was. They apologised but nothing was done. This staff member has since been promoted to a managerial position in the store! "
"Worked with a colleague for 5 months, who always called me, ‘princess’, ‘gorgeous’, ‘flower’, ‘petal’, ‘sweetie’ etc. One day, i confronted him and said, “actually my name isn’t ‘Princess’ or ‘Sweetie’, it’s actually Victoria.” He said, “I don’t care, that’s just my way”. (At this point, my manager, who was watching this unfold, asked me to ‘leave it alone, because he was upset’). I explained that my parents chose to call me Victoria, that is what i shall be called.” He said, “good for you” and then stormed off, bashing and throwing things around because I had made him angry….(?). A couple of days later, he asked me what my name was- did I prefer Victoria or Vicky, or Vic- the kind of conversation you have when you first meet someone, but no, he’d worked with me every day for 12 hours a day for 5 months, and only now did he respect me enough to note my actual name. "
I am two months in to a new job and was recently told by my manager that the only negative feedback he received about me from my interview with HR was that I was not wearing heels. 
"I was in my late 30’s, having lunch with two younger female colleagues who were about 25, when two male colleagues in their 40s passed by. One commented on what a lovely group we made. They then went into a banter that they both clearly thought was charming about how working with “such pretty project managers” make the day go by faster, etc. etc. They didn’t notice our appalled looks and went merrily on their way. One of the younger women then said, “That was gross.” and the other agreed “I feel yucky.” Later that afternoon, I had a weekly meeting with one of the men, who was head of our department. In a calm, friendly tone, I communicated how the earlier conversation seemed more appropriate for a bar than a workplace. I pointed out how the job required myself and my younger colleagues to facilitate teams of diverse people, many of whom had more career experience. And that by emphasizing “pretty” looks as a contributing to our success at our jobs, he and the other colleague were undermining our professional credibility. The director was suddenly mortified at his own behavior. He agreed that we were all quite good at our jobs, and that our effectiveness had nothing to do with being pretty. He also apologized sincerely. He hadn’t thought about how his words furthered everyday sexism and appreciated me bringing it to his attention. Later that afternoon, both of the younger women colleagues came rushing over to my desk in surprise. They had each gotten an email from the director with a sincere apology and recognition of their professional skills. I’m very proud of that moment. It wasn’t an easy conversation to bring up with “the boss”, and to keep cordial about. But by speaking up, I created an opportunity for the director to see everyday sexism for what it is. And I modeled for the younger colleagues that women don’t have to just grin and bear it. It was a win for everyone. "
"I work in a department of 15 people with 2 men. When one of them speaks everyone listens way more than when a woman speaks. One in particular takes up a lot of airtime at every meeting and has a lot of seniority. I was asked to review a document and, in giving my opinion, he began to speak at the same time as me with a contradictory viewpoint. I stopped talking and everyone looked at him while he finished his point. The chair of the meeting offered me another opportunity to speak at which point, he interrupted me again to talk. I didn’t want to not share my point once again, so I resolved to continue with my thoughts in the hopes that he would stop talking and realize that he interrupted me. He didn’t. He kept speaking the entire time that I did. It was incredibly awkward and was also towards the end of our meeting time. In that group of mostly women, no one commented on what happened or acknowledged that what he was doing was wrong. Everyone just left for the rest of their day. I felt angry and sad and also worried that now, someone with seniority, would “not like me”, when all I was trying to do was my job. "
"I work at a restaurant in the kitchen and when we have delivery men come through to drop off beer or food they constantly stare at myself and other women I work with and none of us are comfortable enough to say anything. What is worse is the men around do not say anything either. They make comments about how the men should not have done what they did to us in private, and after the delivery men have left. However, they never do anything to stop these encounters from happening in the first place. "
"While at a mental health daycare centre, some of the men and boys got into trouble with the group leaders for looking up porn involving images of women on the computers. Why the males had to look up these images in the early afternoon on a week day in an open workspace and not at home late at night in private in their spare time is beyond my understanding. None of the women (even ones with severe learning disabilities) dared to look up porn on the network computers at the centre. Lots of visual porn seems to be tailored towards a male audience anyway. The men who looked up the porn on the computers were yelled at by the female group leaders and banished from the tuck shop. The men were then told by the group leaders that they could only marry and have one partner during their lives because that was what Jesus said to do. I know that these men transgressed by looking at porn during daytime working hours, but the way the female group leaders were trying to police the men’s private lives and script their sexuality was very disturbing. I have to say that the female group leaders’ involvement seemed unethical and interfering, but I was powerless to do or say anything about it. They sometimes said that the men were “useless” and “lazy” at doing certain tasks compared to women which was incredibly sexist. Some of the men tried to talk to me about porn and how they thought women should behave in the bedroom. At the same time they were parroting the “everyone has a special destined someone of the opposite sex to marry” lines said by the female group leaders. Everyone was automatically assumed to be heterosexual and straight there because well “Jesus says so”. It was bloody disturbing. I never signed up for this: I was an atheist. It didn’t matter how many video games I played at home or what my interests were, the female group leaders referred to me as a “sweet girl” even though I was a grown woman. Disturbing as heck. I honestly would have been better off talking to a brick wall and listening to the echo than hearing all the tired out gender stereotypes trotted out by the “God Squad” at that place. At least when you talk to a brick wall, you get some sense echoed back, unlike what I heard at that “mental health” establishment. Never ever going there again. It isn’t that I dislike Christians, some of my best friends in the past were Christians! The difference between them and the mental health group leaders, my friends unlike the group leaders didn’t try and shove their religious beliefs plus gender stereotypes down my throat. My Christian friends in the past let me be me and didn’t interfere in my private life because they were decent caring people! "
"I am 17 years old. I work at a movie theatre, where I have recently started dating a boy (let’s call him John) who works there also. We both applied and interviewed for the same leadership position within this theatre. Both of our names were discussed at a meeting in which our managers decided which people would be best for this position out of a handful who applied. When John’s name was brought up to discuss, all of the managers voted a “yes” for him, including a manager (let’s call him Dave), who I will now touch on. When my name was brought up after John’s name, Dave gave an immediate “no” answer for me. When questioned on why he voted no, he quickly explained that since I was dating John, it may be hard for me to keep it professional in the workplace. He also said, “Well, what if she wants to ask off of work a bunch in order to be free to do things with him?”. The other managers in the meeting quickly shot him down on these ideas due to the unfairness of his thoughts. Why were these concerns Dave had about me, but not concerns he had about John? It’s not like I am dating John but he is not dating me. I do not think it was fair for Dave to assume that because I am a girl dating a guy who I work with, that I will immediately become irresponsible, but that John will stay the exact same. It is not fair that I was treated differently for being in a relationship with someone that I genuinely like, but that no concerns about John dating me were mentioned whatsoever. "
"I have over two years of professional experience working in lighting design, and over 6 years experience working and studying furniture design and wood-working. However, I’m only 25 and female working in a male-dominated industry in California. I work with a lot of men, some my age, some older, and my experience and craftsmanship is always parallel or exceeds theirs. However, at a job I recently started, an older man (65+) who helps with general labor, told me that he thought the boss was nicer to me than to himself because I was “pretty.” He said that our boss likes dating younger women, and it made sense that the boss was friendly with me once he saw me. This is just the most recent example of something I can probably never overcome. People think I’m hired for my physically demanding job to satisfy a diversity quota, or because I’m “pretty”… I take pride in what I design and make. What I can accomplish with my hands is the best part about me, and I’m damn good at designing, building, electrical work, and production management. I’ve noticed again and again that people look at my accomplishments differently than my male coworkers. "
"My boss from a low paying, mostly volunteer, job hits on literally every woman under him. He’s the one running the company, no one can say anything to him about it. There was one specific day where he said something obscene to me (I don’t recall now what it was), and I had never been made to feel more uncomfortable in my life. He had been a friend of mine, as well, which was how I found out about the job. With every passing day, his comments to me just grew more and more obscene, until one day, having a long history of sexual assault colouring my life story, I snapped and asked him (albeit very kindly, as he was my friend first and boss second) to stop, mentioning again to him my past. Like I said, he was a friend, he knew my life. I told him why I was uncomfortable with him tossing innuendos and obscene, sexist statements my way made me feel uncomfortable, and hard to deal with him. He told me “Part of life is dealing with your scars. If you can’t handle me, then I don’t think this is the right job for you.” So I then mentioned that he always preached to the rest of his employees to remain professional, that my boyfriend (who was also working for him) and I kept our relationship out of the workplace so as to upkeep our professionalism. I said “How can you expect your employees to remain professional when you don’t even follow your own codes? You are giving me very unwanted sexual attention. In most workplaces, this would be considered sexual assault, and if you and I weren’t friends, I would have slapped you so hard with a sexual harassment lawsuit, your head would be spinning weeks ago.” He didn’t reply. When I woke up the next day, my boyfriend told me I had been fired. My boss couldn’t tell me himself. He couldn’t say those words to me as I confronted him on his blatant hypocrisy and misogyny. He had my own boyfriend tell me the news. How fucking pathetic is that? "
"I was at work and a male customer put his walking stick across me so I couldn’t move and told me he would like to kidnap me, so I could clean his house and he could do whatever he liked. I stopped wearing my name tag because men would try to brush my hair back to see my name, stare at my boobs or say ‘i’ll find you on facebook later’ as they winked at me. I stopped going out at night with my friends because I was sick of men thinking they had a right to touch me after they had, had a drink. I was sick of having my bum grabbed, being grabbed and tried to be kissed, have hands thrust up my dress to grab my thighs and being told I should be grateful for the attention. Men old enough to be my dad, who I would shout at and be told I was a ‘whore’ and ‘bitch’. "
There was a nursing home close to my house and they were looking for somebody to help. i applied for the job and the man who was responsible for the hiring told me that i should look for a job at the gym. I was baffled…. 
"I’ve recently joined a social car scheme as a driver and offered to update the awful website. Id received some poorly written and ambiguous ‘information’ with which to work, so I’d sent 2 or 3 emails to the coordinator asking questions about the organisation, foundation and rules for using the scheme so as to present an informative and professional site. He phoned me about availability to drive, then said “or are you too busy asking questions?” I laughed that off, but then he said “I’m used to 5-year-old girls with a ‘y’ in their name… why this, why that, why,why,why?” This I did not laugh off, but sent him an email asking whether he would have compared a male colleague to a 5-year-old in the same circumstances. He replied (without apology) that it was “an affectionate reference to his great-granddaughter” adding “no offence meant”. "
"I was working early, before we had opened in the morning stocking shelves at my retail job. There were two young, newly hired men also working in my department that morning. At one point I broke a glass jar filled with some kind of oil.They immediately stepped in to help me clean up the mess, though, as I hovered around it they stated more than once that I should “be careful” around the broken glass. They then went together to get a mop, proceeded to mop up the liquid and when they left to fetch a broom as well I began picking up the bigger pieces of the shattered glass. They came back and found me on my knees doing this, and one of the boys instinctively, loudly and with great fear in his eyes yelled “be careful!” I looked back at him, and laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. I could make a fuss and tell them that, while I appreciate their help I am, as a fully formed, human adult, fully capable of being around broken glass without hurting myself, but why bother? Pick your battles, right? "
"Yesterday in work I had been asked to work at the checkout due to how busy the store had become, obviously due to the people getting organised for the holidays. I really love my job, I’m a student which means that this job is only part-time for me but I honestly love working with the public and have had some lovely customers. Then of course there are the not so nice customers. Since I work in a store with heavy furniture ect, I am used to people assuming because I am a small woman that I would struggle to life certain things, this I understand and am not really offended by. However, yesterday after greeting this 50 something year old man with a smile and niceties as you do I immediately seen him give me a strange look and look me up and down. Although this bothered me I decided to brush past it. Once I had helped him back his bags and given him his change he then thanked me by winking at me and using the phrase ‘Good girl.’ I was completely speechless. Praising me like I was some kind of dog that had just barked on command. To make matters worse there was a woman and her young daughter waiting next in the cue, now I’m more annoyed at myself for not pointing out how unacceptable those two little words were. "
"When I was 21, I worked for a company which was a factory with offices on top. The stores manager, in his 50s, was a friendly chap and I thought nothing of chatting with him casually from day to day. One day I went into the stores section of the factory to pick up some supplies for the people I shared an office with. I found the stores manager and told him what I needed and we began picking the things up from the shelves. When I had picked everything I needed, he pushed me against one of the racks of shelving, kissed me and shoved his hand down my pants and put two fingers into me. I pushed him away and ran off. I never told anyone. This incident was the start of my panic attacks which were debilitating at best. In the end, I quit the job without warning. I never told anyone in the workplace what had happened. I couldn’t bear the way they would have looked at me if they’d known, and being a rape survivor I couldn’t face the very real possibility of being dismissed. I’m now 27, and I have only just come to terms with the fact that what happened to me constituted sexual assault. I’m not over it. Not even close. "
Guy DMed me on Twitter after I appeared on a podcast. Said I ‘gave him a few chuckles’ and he ‘enjoyed my music’…then went on to say it helped that I was ‘half pretty’. Not sure what to make of that to be honest mate. All else aside either compliment me or don’t…Wanker 
I work in a joinery shop which is all men apart from me and that’s absolutely fine but the other day I sat next to one of my bosses just as he started making really sexist comments. He was worried because his son had done the washing up a few times that women now ruled the world and were completely in control of men. He believes that we ought to get back in the kitchen and look after children and leave the decision making to the man. He thinks things are taking a turn for the worse and wants to go back to the way it was in the 50s (all this as the only female at work sits down next to him). I was wondering if he was a racist would he have been so open about it if i were black? I’m almost hoping it comes up again so i can set him straight with my colleagues and reassure him that women are still far from gaining equality let alone the upper hand. 
"A few months after I had joined the team, I was approached by a Senior person at one of the company’s we dealt with and asked to meet him as he wanted to ‘get to know me personally’ . I said ‘no’ but when I told my boss he asked if ‘ I might have offended him by saying ‘no’. He then went to discuss the matter at board level and returned to tell me they had decided I had ‘ probably done the right thing’. I have worked at this company for some time now, and that is just the start of the casual sexism which I face every day as the only female senior manager in the team. So many of these examples resonate: being ignored, issues downplayed, forcing me to raise issues my male counterparts don’t even have to consider as part of their day, being excluded from social events …. and on, and on, and on… too many to list.

"Yesterday was the first day of my new job and all was going well until I overheard two male staff rating my appearance within earshot on the shop floor. I moved away so I couldn’t hear any more and went over to try and familiarise myself with the Christmas range. One of them then came over and told me to “chill”. Oh, so sorry for trying to do my job. Telling anecdote of the expectation to just be pretty and smile. "
"I am so disappointed about the glacially slow rate of change in womenâ€™s position in society. 40 years ago I was one of the first women over the threshold when the â€˜menâ€™s unionâ€™ at Edinburgh University became â€˜mixedâ€™ and I really thought the future would be so much different for us than for our mothersâ€™ generation, with equal career opportunities for all. I suppose to some extent things have improved, but as a woman who has been in senior management and who still, in retirement, sits on boards in public life, I am constantly aware of how much less value is placed on our contributions and how much harder we have to work to be where we are, compared to men â€“ who are always in the majority in positions of power and influence. Like the young women who send in their stories, I was harassed by everyday sexist â€˜banterâ€™ when I was young (and my daughter suffers it now in her twenties). But once you get old, as a woman you become invisible, discounted. I donâ€™t know which is worse. "
"Last Saturday, 1am, at the pub I work at on weekends. I was tired because I had already done a night shift the day before and was looking forward to the pub closing its doors. A drunk male customer yelled at me from behind a bar that I should be smiling while serving him a beer. I respectfully replied to him that I was tired and didn’t feel like smiling too much right now. He replied to “give him a smile” and proceeded to say there and tell me that I was “still not smiling” very time I passed by for 5 more minutes. I eventually took in the back room and asked my college who was taking care of glasses to go behind the bar instead of me before risking to crack and insult him. This happens too often and is exhausting. "
"Last week, a colleague (who has just applied to be a supervisor) made a joke about the young lady that recently started at work. The gist of it was about having sex in the customer toilets. When I pointed out that this wasn’t the kind of jokes a potential candidate for supervisor should be making, he said: “It would be consensual. She won’t be able to say no with my dick in her mouth”. Immediately afterwards he realised that he’d taken this too far and insisted it was only a joke. The worst part is that at least one other supervisor was there and said nothing. I had to corner him later to tell him that it was offensive and that he should talk to our colleague about this. I’m pretty certain he didn’t bother. "
"Throughout high school I was working in the restaurant industry. Over the weekends, I would often ask to be scheduled for the morning shifts rather than the night. Because the morning were stock shifts, I was not allowed to take them, only the boys were. I was unable to get the shifts I wanted because I wasnâ€™t strong enough to do certain things. Society teaches people from a young age that boys are stronger, and better at sports, that if they arenâ€™t fast enough or canâ€™t throw far enough they â€œdo it like a girlâ€?. "

"I work at a restaurant/bar. Last night after I got off of work I walked over to the pub section and grabbed a drink with some of my friends who were there for karaoke night. The was a guy who was celebrating his 21st birthday–singing, dancing, yelling, and being belligerently drunk all around. The booth he was sitting at was next to our table. the birthday boy was given a free basket of French fries (just to get some food in his stomach) and promptly dropped them on the floor. I stood up and meant to clean up the mess and save my coworkers from having to do it. As soon as I stood up the guy stumbled into me screamed “oh, you wanna go back to a hotel room baby?!” and proceeded to grab my ass with both hands and try to drag them up my body. I immediately pushed him off of me and into one of the tables, yelled at him to “get the fuck off of me”, and grabbed my purse and left without a word. I was shaking by the time I got into my car and when I got home took three hot showers to stop feeling disgusting in my own skin. I am planning on telling my boss this evening in the hopes that I will never have to see him at my workplace again. "
"I used to work as a barmaid at the local pub and became very friendly with a group of older men (they were regulars). Oddly enough when my mum was in the bar business she used to serve them so they knew myself and my mum. One day we were talking about tattoos as quite a few of them had them. They were showing me them and telling me about the meanings and stories around them, they were always pleasant to me but…one decided to join the conversation. “I’ve got a tattoo’. He then unzipped his trousers, I panicked and looked at his eyes, I didn’t want to look down. I said ‘stop’ whilst his friends recoiled and looked away, he chuckled and then zipped his trousers back up. I then carried on with the bar work to escape the situation, I told my manager and we looked at the CCTV at the end of the shift as I wasn’t sure if he did get IT out our not (why would I want to look down?). The CCTV was fuzzy but, it really did look like IT and his friends reaction re-assured that. My manager didn’t want to loose their custom because they were regulars and unfortunately this man was the king pin, if we banned him we lost all of the group. So I urged not to do anything…and faded into silence. Only my boyfriend knows I couldn’t say anything to my parents, I ended up leaving that pub…If I had looked down I would be 100% sure if he did or didn’t expose himself, but I’ll never know to this day and honestly I’ll never forget.

"I am the only woman in the data science team at work. We had a meeting with an external vendor who was trying to sell his products to us. On greeting me, he told me how impressed he was that a woman was on the team and how he’d just come from another meeting with three women in another data science group – with a tone implying that this was quite hilarious and astonishing to him. He even said to me ‘well done’ for even just being in the room. I wish I had been on the ball enough to reply with a suitable put down but instead made do with saying a curt, sarcastic ‘thank you’. I was fuming for the rest of the meeting. However, it’s worth saying that immediately after the meeting two of my male colleagues who had also been present in the meeting expressed their outrage to me and apologised for the vendor’s behaviour and how unacceptable it was.

"I received an unsolicited email to my work account today from a company called Sun Frog advertising ‘funny’ t-shirts for company directors saying thinks like “trust me I’m a director”, “director – because miracle worker isn’t an official job title” and “keep calm and let the director handle it”. It also promoted one which said “director’s wife – yes he’s working, no I don’t know when he’ll be home”. There was no such equivalent for “director’s husband”. So in this company’s mind, in 2016, directors are all (straight) men. I’ve been a director at this company for 4 years and my very obviously female name is in my email address – so not only are they sexist,they just don’t care about letting women know it (and their target marketing is as shoddy as their products). #fightthepatriarchy "
"I work as a part time waitress at a golf club. The members are mostly old, fat men who drink a hell of a lot of beer and are very full of themselves. The amount of times I’ve been called darling or sweetheart to try and get them extra favours in nauseating. They also frequently compliment my bum and legs, especially when I’m cleaning a table or the bar. It’s incredibly uncomfortable and even more so when the next day they are accompanied by their wives and continue with the same behaviour. The worse interactions I’ve had is having my bum slapped multiple times and when I told them I was hopeful to go to Cambridge they told me I was going to live a sad life without any husband or fun. I told my boss and she simply said I had to put up with it, the members pay a lot of money to be there and they except a ‘familiarity’ to come along with their memberships’ huge price tag. So this means I cannot fight back as I normally would in the street or at school. Ah yes I should comment on that – it gets worse when you know I’m only 17 and most of them are over 50. "
"I work in a corporate environment on a well reputed graduate scheme that I got onto because I have all the academic requirements, passed aptitude tests and a multiple stage interview process. I’m really proud of my position, however it means I am one of the youngest women in a male dominated office. Throughout my employment I’ve been with the same long term boyfriend hav never given any of the men mentioned in the following paragraphs reason to believe their behaviour was welcomed. Once in my first year (i was 21) after working on a three month project involving very long hours and personal sacrifice, at the team’s celebratory dinner a fellow grad schemer (male) introduced me to the senior partner who had led the project. When the partner asked how the project had gone for me, my colleague said that I had done really well and the team had valued my contribution. The partner replied by saying ‘of course you enjoyed having her on the team, just look at her’ while blythly gesturing towards my breasts. this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and totally made a mockery of all the hard work I had put in. I was encouraged not to complain by my female manager who justified the partner’s behaviour by saying he was drunk, and had a wife and kids. I went along with this because I was new to the firm and trusted her advice, but I later came to know that he frequented strip clubs with our male clients, and he clearly had no issue treating women as objects. Recently on another another team that was all male, where I was no longer the most junior, two of my seniors took to ‘affectionately’ calling me their bitch, whore, slut, dumb blonde, ho or anything else that came to mind. The final straw came when the manager gave me an on the spot bonus (genuinely for good performance) and in the card announcing it wrote ‘to d.b’. when I asked what it meant he said it stood for dirty bitch. I took him aside and told him it wasn’t on, and he protested that he was only joking and that I should know not to take it personally. I had to break it down and explain tht his words undermined me in front of juniors, and singled me out because they could only be used against a woman. They made it impossible for me to be treated as an equal. He saw what I meant, was mortified and totally stopped, but his total failure to realise that he was innappropriate is far from unique. He thought he was being inclusive by ‘letting me be part of the lads banter’. This workplace attitude that some men have that ‘we’re all lads and it’s all just a laugh’ allows casual sexism to remain endemic in the office. "
"Had to call out sexism at work today. Saw a training video for Blood Borne Pathogens. The training video did their best at portraying young and older men, thinner and bearish body type men, and black, white and hispanic men. When the thing was over, the host of the training asked us what we thought about it. “I found it completely sexist. There was only one woman in the training film, and she was made out to look like an idiot.” This is incredibly sad, as approximately half of the people I work with are women, and none are idiots. "
"I started noticing that my boss liked to touch my back slightly or call my sexy or sex pot a lot whilst at work. He laughed whilst he said it which made me feel like i was stupid for finding it annoying. I knew in my head it wasn’t right. He even told my mum who i worked with how much he thought i was gorgeous. That made me feel gross, seeing as he has a wife and two kids. Anyway he left and two years late i found a message from him on twitter asking me how i was and what i was up to. Needless to say i didn’t reply. "
"Because I really can’t actually send this to my coworkers: “I fail to understand why you think it is appropriate to use female body parts as a punchline in your jokes. What the hell do you mean when you say you’re “thinking of leaving too because your Fallopian tube hurts?” The best I can gather is that you are attempting to insult someone by saying they are like a woman – when in fact, you are insulting the woman on the other side of the cubical wall – because such a “joke” implies that being a woman is somehow inferior to being a man. Or that one should be ashamed of having Fallopian tubes. Maybe this wouldn’t bother me so much if you and your cronies didn’t constantly project this notion in the workplace, if I didn’t hear one of you say goodbye each day by calling you ladies, again, as if being a woman is a joke-worthy inferiority. Maybe it wouldn’t bother me if I didn’t hear one of you ponder whether your boss is on her period every time she irritates you (FYI – it’s not the week that you are on your period that you are hormonal, it’s the week before. Pre- is the P in PMS. If you want to discuss female specific issues, at least be somewhat educated about it, or something). Look, I know it’s hard to see and injustice that does not affect your day to day life in a painful, dehumanizing, and shameful way. But every time you make a joke like that, you are playing into a system that teaches girls they aren’t as capable as boys, and I know some of you have daughters (I hate that I even feel the need to evoke this point, because one should not have to have female offspring to care about the well-being and equality of woman, but whatever). Do you really wish to continue to project onto your peers that being a woman is a joke to you? Trust me, your daughter will eventually pick up on it, consciously or not. This office already tells me each and every day that women are not-as-welcome here. Even without your nonsense “jokes” and bullshitting, I can just see in the numbers that women don’t really belong here. I can see in the numbers that women are viewed as clerical workers, not as fit for “man’s work.” And hell, I don’t even need the fucking numbers. I recall a recent newsletter celebrating our one female engineer as “The Unicorn.” Yknow, cause women in technology don’t exist – or at least that’s the message underneath it all (sadly, this was actually written by a woman, which goes to show how ingrained this sort of problematic thinking is). Next time you want to use female anatomy as a punchline, please think about the message you are sending between the lines. Better yet, just don’t do it again.” "
"At a work event with colleagues a guy got mad at my team and he threw the two guys in my team in the water and then came for me. I ran and as he was about to catch up with me I hugged a pole as hard as I could. He ripped me off it, he carried me violently and I screamed for help. He dropped and I hit a rock with my face. I broke teeth and had them removed and had to suffer endlesly for a long time and still do. At the hospital I was asked if I wanted to report an abuse, but I had no one then to tell me it was okay. Afterwards my bosses told me to talk about it as an accident. I never got to tell the truth. My works insurance paid for the medical costs. The guy walked away from the situation with no scars, and he never got a punishment. The scary part is, the doctors told me a landing with a few centimetres difference would most likely have killed me. I as a victim was silenced so that my abuser would lose nothing even though I was centimetres from death. "
"Over the past 16 years since puberty: followed by men in cars, honked at, followed by men on foot – even into shops after being told to go away, propositioned, asked for my phone number then told I’m a whore/slut/bitch/stuckup/frigid woman for not giving my number to a strange man, jerked off to multiple times in busy public parks, interrupted, had things condescendingly explained to me, harassed at work, had comments made about my body/looks in the workplace or other inappropriate situations, being told to calm down because I’m “emotional” or because “being angry won’t help” … Most recently: I am a private language tutor. I put up classified ads on websites, with a professional photo and a description of my rates and philosophy on teaching. In the past 2 weeks I have been called 3 times from my ad: 1 person seeking lessons for their kid… and 2 young men who made it clear that they were looking for something other than language lessons. The first was quite insistent. He called me back even after I told him he was making me uncomfortable and not to call back. I regret not having kept his phone number to give to the police. "
All of my colleagues are constantly asking me how I plan to balance having a family with my career and exams as a doctor. I have never mentioned wanting children. Not one of them has ever asked my male colleague (whose wife is currently pregnant) how he plans to balance his family life with his work life. 
"I’m a manager. When I emailed several colleagues to remind them to set up a training session (the first reminder in two months), one of my mail colleagues emailed back “If you’re going to nag me, I’d prefer you didn’t do it in a public email.” When I complained to my line manager about use of the word “nag”, I was told that it would be hard to argue that “nag” used against me was a loaded term. Even after I copied in links to at least two online articles looking at language like “nag” and how it is almost always used against women. I just had to accept that a male colleague could accuse me of nagging him when I was doing my job by asking him to do a part of his. "
"Moments before his surgery, an elderly man in Savona refused to be operated on when he discovered the anaesthetist on shift was a woman. The 70-year-old was to undergo surgery at the San Paolo hospital in Liguria last week to repair an inguinal hernia. Medical staff had performed the required pre-surgery x-rays, blood tests and electrocardiograms, but as he was being prepped in the operating room the patient suddenly refused to let surgery to his groin area proceed unless the anaesthesia was administered by a man. â€œBuongiorno. I am the anaesthetist you donâ€™t want. Would you like to tell me what the problem is?â€? the doctor told him. The patient said not to take it personally but he had heard “talk” about the hospital’s female medical staff and did not want to be treated by one. His wife also joined the argument, insisting â€œno woman would lay a hand on him.â€? Frustrated, angry and with five other surgeries lined up for the afternoon, the anaesthetist and lead surgeon called their superiors before returning with a solution. â€œThis is not a private clinic and you canâ€™t choose your doctor from a catalogue,â€? she told the patient. â€œWe have this team on shift today, so if you are fine with that then letâ€™s go into the operating room and do what we need to do, otherwise, the head of surgery suggests you sign to be dismissed and be treated in a private structure where you can demand whatever you like. Good day. â€? The man signed the paperwork and left the hospital. Head of Anaesthesiology Brunello Brunetto defended his medical team, saying â€œregardless of their gender, all the anaesthetists have my trust and are all fully capable of fulfilling their role.â€?

"I wanted to get into medical school, so I tried to get some experience by volunteering at a local place that cared for kids with Down’s syndrome. I got an interview there, but was rejected. I went back to ask why, and on the down low one of the interviewers told me “we couldn’t be sure you wouldn’t sexually abuse the Down’s syndrome kids. We don’t really take men on as volunteers”. I thought about making a complaint. But I didn’t, because if I kicked up a fuss and they did start taking on men, what if one of those men really did abuse the kids? I’m still not sure how I feel about this- they were definitely sexist, but were they right? Men really are much more likely to sexually abuse kids than women. Was I sexist against men for kind of agreeing with the interviewers? "

"I’m currently studying to work in TV, in sound, and I’m overwhelmed by the imbalance between the number of males and females currently in the positions I want to go into. In various placements I’ve had, of the 20 or so people I’ve worked with, I’ve met 3 women. There was one instance when there was a young girl who needed a mic putting on, and I had to step up because I was with 5 male sound assistants, and this makes me wonder how on earth this industry functions with such a predominantly male workforce. They tell me that they need more females on sound, but that I’ll have to work for it. Others tell me that the women are doing better than men at the moment, and that I’ll get a job easily because they need more women. But I don’t want to be hired to make their workplace more diverse: I want being good at what I do to be the main factor of my future employment. "
"At my workplace, I am always the subject of sexual harassment from customers and my boss. I am paid minimum wage under the table, and god knows I need it. My boss had made several uncomfortable remarks such as pointing out a spill on my shirt, while staring at my breasts and saying “I am telling you this because if it was a customer they would be looking at your breasts”… Or while putting whipcream on a drink, I got some on myself and he said “Oh you’re getting that white stuff all over you” and winking He constantly tells me that I must go to yoga with him or “tell your parents i’ll drive you home tonight, i’m buying us dinner” and I always make up some excuse of how I am busy directly after work and he is still persistent. Once when I was complaining about hurting my back he told me he knew a stretch that would make it feel better. He told me to sit down on a chair, straddling it backwards. Thinking that he would just tell me to lean from side to side to stretch out my back, I humored him and did it. He then squeezed my hips, and ran his hands down my thighs as I was trapped between him and a wall. I was so shocked and embarrassed I didn’t know what to say- I just pretended it never happened. I know I should have said something to the owner- but I didn’t want to ruin this guy’s life. I know this man should be responsible for his actions, but my own guilt gets in the way. "
"A police officer would commonly come into my workplace to get coffee before he went out on his shift. My boss was good friends with him, and expected me to be very nice to him as well. He would come behind the counter and give me a very touchy hug, and often tell me not to be “naughty” or tell me that I had a “sexy body” and take his coffee for free. I told my boss that this made me uncomfortable, but told me that he was a “very important customer” and that you “didn’t want to mess with the cops.” I was a 16 year old girl, and believed that my manager had my best interest in mind.

I decided to tell him that I am not interested and few months after I was fired. I typed in our company’s intranet: “sexual harassment.” Whilst we have guidelines on literally everything, this was the very first topic with only one sentence: “if you feel like you are being sexually harassed, refer to your HR partner”. I raised my case with HR and because my boss was at the top of our hierarchy and an instrumental man, they decided to cover up his doings. They took away my badge an computer and started a witch hunt against me. I learnt a lot about trust and politics, this ugly story also revealed many people’s true faces. I learnt not to trust man, even if they seem sound: married & 5 kids, or smiley and emphatetic.

A few of the things he said in general began to grate on me – comments about customers, about his long term partner at home. An example is that “she’s going out tonight, so that means I won’t get any dinner tonight” As time has gone on however, the comments have become more disturbing. As I was picking something up at work, he said to me “you’re so dirty, bending over like that in front of me” another time he said “I bet you’re the kind of girl who likes dressing up”. I have told him how inappropriate he is being. He told me that a new colleague, who is 18 years old (he in his 50s), is a posh bitch who he needs to take out the back and give her a good seeing to. The last straw was when he put his arms around me. I pushed him away and yelled at him to never touch me again. I told the store manager. He just laughed. "
"Having a work evaluation yesterday my boss said, you know your a great coach and you deserve the highest rating, however, your male counter part is way more experienced then you, he does the job better you and no wonder the girls look up to him, my boss said it’s is expected it is a predominentally male job, and I need to learn to do my job from him because he is a man. Hearing the sexist remark, about how women don’t have the same “appeal” or “experience” as men do in the same job was hurtful and sends the wrong message to the young women I coach. Knowing that sexism is still present even though I have taken the reins to change the tide it hurt me a lot. "

"A middle-aged male servant of a neighbor, a relative in my own home and my oldest brother tries to fondle me sexually when I was 4 to 7 years old. Eve-teasing and unwanted touch was a fairly common thing in crowded public transport in India. Mos painful was a push by an elbow from a stranger in National Public Library of Kolkta. I was only 19 and it was so painful and shocking I could not even scream. I just went in a back pew and sobbed. A male do not know what it is to walk in a girl’s shoe even in middle class educated circles. A girl begins to lose their voice within family and school (even in girl’s school) very early. How can they take leadership role or authority in the workplace or community when they do not feel basic safety and security about their body. The objectification of women in bollywood movies affect every area of society. "
"I work on the tills in a supermarket, meaning I come into contact with hundreds of different people every working day. Although there are the occasional harmless oddballs, most customers are polite enough. I normally feel safe in my job and enjoy the interaction with people. I went to work today at 1pm, a little hung over but ready for the grind of a 3 hour shift. The first 20 minutes were uneventful enough. I served customers and took a slight interest in the new employee being trained on the till next to me. Then in the middle if a rush of customers, my manager came walking over with the portable phone to his ear. “Customer wants to talk to you” he said and handed me the phone, taking over on the till so I could speak. I was confused. This has never happened before. In the three years I’ve worked at this shop, no-one had ever phoned the store asking for me. Was there some kind of family emergency? But he’d said it was a customer. “Hello?” “Hi, you served me earlier. I just wanted to say I think you’re really pretty” “Um… Thanks?” “I was just wondering…” His tone was casual. I could see where this was going. He was going to ask for my number or ask me out on a date and I’d politely refuse and feel slightly flattered and continue my day “I was just wondering if I could lick your vagina?” I hung up immediately and passed the phone back to my manager, my hand shaking. “You can have this back. I don’t want to speak to him” “What did he say? Was he a weirdo? He sounded a bit weird” But I couldn’t bring myself to repeat it. I went back on the tills, still physically shaking. I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t get my head around it. This man had asked for me specifically. Had known my name. Knew where I worked and what I looked like. I knew nothing about him. What if he came back in? Or followed me home? I didn’t stop shaking for the next half hour and didnt stop thinking about it for the rest of my shift. The fact that anyone can think that it’s ok to phone someone up at their workplace and say those things is appalling, whether it was genuine or for a joke or a dare. I’ve never felt unsafe at work until today. "
"We are several woman that work on a team. We are really bright and have a lot of ideas. My boss felt threatened and hired someone (a friend it turned out) to reorganize our office. This person suddenly became our direct boss. All our ideas were stolen by him for which he took the credit. The reorganization occured in such a way that four men were given manager roles, all becoming our superiors and all earing more than us. We were no longer invited to meetings. Reports discredited us. Men in our team with whom we got along well with began adopting behaviour that was insulting. We were ordered to do tasks that belong to a director role but were told we would not be payed more. It was awful but we women united and fought. The hired direct boss quit, couldn’t cover himself anymore because we were too smart. But we still have the big boss to deal with. We are exhausted. We manage our jobs, our children, our homes. We believe that men and women deserve equal respect. "
"At work in a hospital car park, refilling my screenwash. Parking attended approaches me and says “Eeee you better watch what you’re doing pet, women shouldn’t be under a bonnet”. I replied “Why is that?” His response “Well you’s don’t know what yous are doing with cars”. My response “I really don’t see what my gender has to do with my ability to maintain my own car, your views are sexist”. A very normalised bias to add to the catalogue. "

My job was to search the female concert goers (I am a woman) to make sure that they were not carrying any weapons or illegal substances. I always dreaded this job because there would always be drunk men attempting to get into my line and asking why I couldn’t pat them down. Even in uniform I felt like less than nothing. "

"Today, I was confronted on why women feel as though they should have a place standing next to our great men who fill combat positions for this country. This is the first time someone has approached me on this subject, but it is definitely not the first time I have heard it coming from another soldier. I constantly feel the need to defend my right to be in the military, and this is an extension of that. Historically, there are some cultures who allowed, even encouraged women to fight alongside men. Also, women secretly fought in the civil war, disguising themselves as men to protect their rights, and none were ever the wiser. I am proud to serve our country, to uphold the rights of our citizens, and I wish deeply that those rights would include gender equality within the military. "
"Work meeting with CEO of large furniture company. Arrived early when only I was only one in office. Repeatedly rubbed top of my arm and announced I looked Scandinavian, asked me to make him a coffee. Stood very close and made me generally uneasy. Later meeting with other colleagues and said man. He repeatedly told me and the two other woman present that he was trying to ‘de-mystify’ the buying process for us exclusively. That the two men present would try and help us with it….I pointed out that we had been using this programme for quite some time, and he patted me on top of the head….and laughed. Two male colleagues (one, my director) also laughed. They asked us to make a round of coffee/drinks and then after dismissing us from meeting took this charming man out for lunch… The pervasive atmosphere of cloying sexism is thick enough to drown in… "
"Several years ago I was in a meeting with four male colleagues of whom one was more senior to me and one was in a junior position. There was no-one to take the minutes of the meeting, so the senior colleague asked if one of us would volunteer to take the minutes. Without any words being spoken the male junior colleague pushed the pad of paper and pen across the table to me and the other male colleagues laughed. To my credit, I pushed the pad of paper back to him, also without saying anything. However, to this day I still feel belittled by that act and by the fact that the others thought that it was funny.

"Today I went for a job trial. The trial was at a shop VERY close to where I used to work. As the woman was showing me some basics, one of my ex-coworkers passed by, recognised me and said “Hi”. I didn’t think too much of it and responded with “hello”. A few minutes later I saw my ex manager, the one who was constantly sexually harassing me when I worked with him, coming down the street. I felt sick, but I reasoned that, since they had various shops along the street then he could be going towards one furthest away from the main shop. These hopes were dashed as I saw him stop and start looking around the front door of the shop that I was in. It was obvious to me that my co-worker had told everyone I was around again and that he had come down to try and intimidate me. As I watched him look for me, I hear good ol’ man baby screaming my name. In the middle of a work trial, he felt it appropriate to come INSIDE the shop, grab me roughly around the shoulders and start saying things like “forgot your old friends did you?”. This, of course, caught my former manager’s attention and he came around the corner to glare at me and watch. The woman who was showing me the basics didn’t look impressed and called them assholes when they left. They felt it okay to lay hands on me and try to embarrass and intimidate me. They’re fucking disgusting. "
"I’m a lawyer. I’m the most senior person in my office most of the time as my boss (the only person senior to me) is often overseas. When he’s away I pick up his phone if it rings and his assistant is away. At least twice a week I am asked if I am his secretary, I always answer with a simple “no” and no further elaboration. When my assistant, who is male, sends emails to clients they respond with “Dear Ms XXX” because they can’t fathom that a man can be an assistant, let alone assistant to a woman. When we attend business development events with other lawyers the men often assume that another junior male colleague is my boss. My colleague doesn’t disabuse them of this but I do and he doesn’t like it. I’ve pointed out that I’m not being unkind, simply correcting a misunderstanding. Apparently he finds it “humiliating” to be publicly “put in place”. Two tears in a bucket, baby… "
"Everyday at school I’m subject to rude looks by boys. That’s because they claim I have “big tits.” Furthermore, ever since Trump won the presidency, they keep on telling me they want to “grab me by the pussy.” I must admit, my breasts are quite large, but boys have no right to catcall me in such a degrading manner. I mean, who would they feel if I said I’d “grab them by the dick.” That’s why the world must come together to end the horrible misogynistic, sexist, and racist society that has plagued our downhill country today.

"I am a female comedian in London. Last night I performed at an open mic gig that has typically been one of the more liberal on the circuit. I was one of three females on the list of twelve, which is above average in this environment. Nearly every single act attacked women. Whole sets about various “insane” ex-girlfriends who do tai chi visualising snapping their ex’s penises off (huh? Also topical reference mate), multiple comics making multiple jokes about fucking their mothers, pompous rants about Trump being unfairly treated because Hilary is way worse (spoiler alert – she’s not), women placed as subservients in a variety of set ups, and an almost endless stream of men being alone but it all being women’s fault. And worst of all, the closing act is someone I remember being creative, surreal, and enigmatic. His mum fucking jokes were the worst. This environment breeds it. And it’s fucking shit. I’m not doing the circuit anymore. Instead I’m putting on my own gigs with people I love. Because fuck any more of my time being spent listening to these arseholes. After this week especially, it’s the misogynist straw that’s broken this camel’s back. "

Her husband visited the gym about a week later and I asked after his wife to see how she was whilst walking with him to the gym.

Just what my mother would say to me when I tried to talk to her about it. Oh you think you have problems, she says. Amazing. Across the board self loathing projected. Can you imagine a bereaved man being told tobwatch elephants on YouTube to cheer up. The moment my brother has any issue the whole family races to save him. Amazing. "
"When I was 19, I earned the role of assistant manager at a local community pool for the summer because I was remarkably responsible for my age. The manager to whom I was assigned, a middle aged, male gym teacher, didn’t like that I had gotten the job. On my first day, in front of the other assistant manager, a male that was 2 years older than me, he told me that I shouldn’t be there and that he could bend me over his desk and violate me with a baseball bat that was leaning next to the desk. The other assistant manager laughed. I stayed for several weeks anyway and tried to do the job but the staff was encouraged to haze me. My friends participated in messing with my food and damaging my car and personal items. I ended up quitting the job. I had no one to report it to. I had a very messed up home life where things weren’t much better. It didn’t even seem like that big a deal to me because I had so many other violations before that and since. I am 43 years old now and I’m grateful that we have come far enough for me to protect other women and confront offenders loudly and openly. I am damn proud to say that although it is unfortunate that my 17-year old daughter has had a run-in or two with sexist or violative behavior, she handled it like a BOSS and didn’t ever consider shrinking away in fear, shame, or acceptance that that’s just how it is. She asked for help and justice because she knew I had guns blazing to protect her and I prepared her for how to handle it. "
"At a conference – have spent the day talking to engineers about what my company does and how we can help them do what they do better. Mostly, but certainly not entirely men – the pharma industry has a reasonably good record of employing women. In fact, the chair of the organisation hosting the conference is female. In the evening, there is a black tie event – all good. Until we got to the after dinner speaker. Who seemed to have been airlifted straight out of 1973. Told us his hero was Les Dawson.

"I am a 30 year old woman from a fairly privileged background. The first instance of sexual assault that I can remember, I was 11 years old. A man came up behind me in the street and pulled up my skirt so that everyone could see my pants. I wheeled around as he and his friends laughed and pointed. I can still remember the feelings of shock, upset and humiliation. In my early twenties I experienced unwanted sexual attention from several male colleagues in various jobs. In my first ever job, there was an older, more senior colleague who would come up behind me at my desk and start massaging my shoulders, would stand too close and on one occasion came in from the cold and put his hands on my cheeks (supposedly to show me how cold it was outside). I didn’t like it but didn’t report it, as it was a small organisation and I didn’t know how to deal with it. I even blamed myself, thinking that I had perhaps been too friendly – how naive. During the same year I had problems with my neck and shoulders and went to visit an osteopath who sexually assaulted me. The experience left me shaken and angry – but, again, I didn’t report it. In subsequent jobs I have been hassled and harassed by male colleagues, with behaviour ranging from staring in an intimidating way to making inappropriate comments to just being suggestive – for instance, a male colleague recently raised his eyebrow and smirked when I explained that I had booked into the same hotel as him for a conference. As a young women I have been heckled, propositioned, grabbed and groped multiple times in the street. Sometimes it has been a case of being wolf-whistled, other times I have had my bum pinched and other times I have been yelled at with comments like “Sexy!” Other behaviour has been more threatening – being followed down the street or, once, being grabbed forcefully by the arm by a man who snarled “Give it to me” right into my face before loosening his grip. Travelling alone by train just a few months ago, I noticed some young men pointed to me and talking about me. When I called them out on it and asked why they were staring and pointing, they just jeered and dismissed me, and one of them called me “girl”. I pointed out that I was a woman. The most bizarre thing that has happened to me recently is one Saturday morning I picked up a voicemail on my mobile that had been left at about 3am the night before. In the message, a male voice addressed me by my first name and asked if I was “ready to prostitute tonight”. I didn’t recognise the voice or the phone number it came from, but I saved the message and reported it to the police. I have not yet received any follow-up from the police, and I understand this kind of thing won’t be their number one priority, but at the same time it is unpleasant and I would like them to follow through. On the other hand, I have positive things to focus on so maybe I will just leave it. It occurred that although I have thankfully not ever been the victim of a serious sexual assault, if you add all my experiences together, I have actually been subjected to quite a lot of abuse and harassment – all while just trying to go about my everyday life, getting from A to B, exploring a city, earning a living. Why should I be demeaned like this just because I am a woman? "
"Ive typically worked in male-dominated fields. I have seen all the levels of gender discrimination. Lately, a male boss, who constantly interrupts me, but not the guys, said that in war, raping and pillaging is rad. I was baffled. I said it wasnt really an appropriate comment at work, but instead of a sorry, I get told that my reaction was the problem, not the statement, and that I need to be more professional amd less emotional at work. I didn’t act emotional. I was sorta stunned. A few days later I get a long text, yes a text, detailing how evidently all the sudden, ive been doing a terrible job for months, altho this wasnt mentioned until I had a problem with the pro-rape comment "
"Just overheard a conversation in a cafe, between a film director to his male friend. He had received texts from an actress who he had recently worked with, containing allegations of sexual harassment that she had experienced on his set – including sexual comments made by himself and other male crew members, and pressure to perform in scenes that she as uncomfortable with. The director’s response? To read out her messages loudly and disparagingly to his friend. To call her an ‘absolute nobody’ and a ‘silly little baby.’ Worst of all, to state that the problem was, that he had been Too Nice to these women – that by complaining, they were simply taking advantage of him because he was Such A Nice Guy. As an actress and a woman, I left feeling shaken and furious. "
"When discussing abortion, an ex colleague of mine was heard to remark that he didn’t think it should be an easy decision for women. When asked to elaborate he answered something along the lines of “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that it’s a good thing that they be emotionally traumatised, but it just shouldn’t be such an easy decision y’know? They should feel SOME lasting consequences from it…”. Right. Okay. Totes legit point of view. *eye rolls* "
"I work at a wedding venue. We have these screens that we put up so guests cannot see the band set up their stage. The screens are just metal frames with thin fabric stretched across them, large but light. I carried one over and began to undo a screw so that I could fix the stand to it. Within seconds three male guests rushed over, took it off me and said ‘don’t worry we’ll do it!’ …I was sorta surprised and not sure if to laugh or what?! As staff we are polite to the wedding guests, so my instinct was to be obliging; they’re just trying to help and you have to try not to refuse a guest if it can be helped. But… I am perfectly capable of undoing a screw. I am also the one at work here, I can do my job. "
"I ran the business end of an organization. We had a meeting of all the managers of the organization and that day the owner of the organization picked me up, it was a lunch meeting. I was the only woman. We arrived at the restaraunt and it was Hooters. I cannot tell you how uncomfortable I felt. I did mention the fact that it was innaproptiate to have a business meeting at Hooters. They all laughed. It was a big joke. They proceeded to comment on the breasts of the wait staff and that the wait staff at Seattle’s Hooters had much smaller breasts than the other Hooters around the country. I am still haunted by this meeting. When I have told others about this meeting they laugh. Its funny, not inappropriate, not ridiculous, no one sees that this is something I should not have been subjected to. Its a funny story, something to laugh about. I don’t see it that way…. "

"Male colleagues talking about a current news story in the background, I wasn’t listening to as I was doing some work. One of them said something along the lines of ‘Pretty soon it’ll just be E (me) in charge’ to laughs from other colleagues. Felt fairly angry that the thought of me being in charge of something was such a laughable idea to them. Only to then be asked if I’ve ever read a fairly popular newspaper… My response was one of disbelief, followed by a sarcastic ‘I’m a bit more clever than I look…’. Later that day I was in meeting with same two male colleagues. I come up with an idea, which is agreed to, only to then have this idea explained back to me by the same colleague who had earlier asked if I’d ever read the paper. At first I thought he was going over the idea to get it straight in his head, until I realised I was actually having it mansplained back to me. Unbelievable. "

I rarely sign my name to my responses, but I’m always sure to on these ones. I’m certain the sexist customer never gets the point. "

"Where to begin? As a child when I was molested? Or when my mother tried making me have a pink Sweet Sixteen birthday party? Or when my father expected me to help chop wood and wash windows but wouldn’t take me to play golf? Or my first job where one of the managers “tried it on” with me. No, maybe when the job expected me to wear a short skirt. And the next job. And the next. Nearly every job has paid me less than the guys I worked with. I nearly always worked at places geared for guys – in printing and in house painting. My ex-husband expected me help him on the job (carpentry) but also have dinner ready, the house cleaned and the child attended to. One of the worst places for sexism has been our public school system, where they just assumed that I wasn’t working and could show up at any point in a day for school events, as the mother of one. I attended all school functions. Her father none. And I was furious once when my daughter was told, in Sunday School, that she and all the girls would play the sheep in a play, while the boys played lions. I never dressed her in skirts and she could pick any color she wanted. But I guess the worst case of sexism for me personally came from my uncle, a physicist who worked for NASA once, when I asked him about being an astronaut and he ignored me. So I thought about becoming a stewardess (attendant) on a plane instead. But I was too short. Later on I thought about joining the Navy (in the 1970’s) but their dress code for women then included girdles, bras, nylons, heels and skirts. I didn’t wear any of that. No, I’m not gay or trans. I just find that dressing like that is silly. The kind of things I like to do doesn’t work with clothes like that. I think the sexism inherent in our clothing is something that keeps putting us women “in our place”. Thank goodness we can own property and vote now! "
"Having had two babies and returned to work full time I am constantly told that it’s ‘oh so hard leaving them’. That’s right, not asked. Constantly I’m asked ‘but why wouldn’t you want to work part time now you have your babies?’ And told, ‘but you’ll be wanting to drop your hours now though’. My husband and I both have a day a week where we are chief parent on our own (with weekends together) and he gets comments like ‘your missus has you under the thumb then’, and ‘it’s so lovely that you help out, you’re amazing’. No actually. I don’t feel guilty. I want to work full time, I like my job and love being a parent too. I also know that my children are attached, well adjusted, loved and love us. I am just as amazing as my husband who enjoys not just helping out. And there are no giant thumbs hovering over anyone in our house either. "
"At my last job most of my coworkers were hispanic men, very nice guys and shorter than I am as a tallish white female. I would be putting a heavy box up on a high shelf, reaching and balancing it on my fingertips, and they would invariably jump over and say “let me, let me get that for you!” Ridiculous because I’m taller than them, but they just had to be chivalrous always. It amuses me to remember it and it amused me at the time, but it also rubs me the wrong way. I know that their intentions were only good, and they were in no way implying that I couldn’t handle it myself. But come on man, I can lift a dumb box, and I can reach the dumb shelf ok? Just stop. I didn’t mind my coworkers, but one time when I was helping my cousin move I was really pissed off. My cousin’s boyfriend who I know well and his buddy, a family friend, were unloading furniture from the truck. I had been carrying furniture up the to the second floor apartment all morning and these two guys had just arrived. I asked them to give me something. The boyfriend handed me a couch cushion and said “Here, you can take this.” He was completely serious. He *truly believed* that a couch cushion was all I could carry. I decided then that they clearly preferred to do the rest of the moving by themelves and went up and assembled some Ikea chairs. "

I was told that my poster was â€œcuteâ€?

When asked for a picture near my poster I was told to smile more (which I probably would not have been told to do if I were male). Iâ€™m sure many would say that Iâ€™m overreacting but word choice is important and an atmosphere of implicit gender bias can be just as harmful as blatantly sexist remarks. "

Fast forward a few months and suddenly my boss and this other person are now the partners on this steering group and I have been ousted. Baring in mind that I was only off on mat leave for 9wks due to the companies lack of mat leave/pay and would easily have been able to continue with my role in the steering group as they only met ever couple of months. Neither my boss or this other person have the skills or qualifications that I do… nor do they have the same job as me. Discrimination to the core! "
"My male boss makes fun of me for wearing the same few outfits to work all the time. He doesn’t make fun of the men we work with who do the same. He also always wears one of two similar pairs of pants, and a fairly predictable choice of shirts as well. "
"I was sexually harassed by my just-former boss. He started pursuing me at his leaving drinks, cornering me away from everyone else. I felt had to talk to him and ‘be nice’, especially as he was staying in the company and same floor of the office. He proceeded to ask me out by texting my work phone, I politely declined when pushed for an answer the next day. Over the next couple of months I received many inappropriate texts and emails to my work accounts. As someone then within my first year of full time office employment I knew it wasn’t right, but it made it seem more acceptable as he was a middle aged boss and I expected him to know right from wrong. It soon became apparent that he does not. He also knew I was vulnerable at the time, due to a nasty living situation (I am now in a new place with lovely flatmates), I have no doubt that this only encouraged his behaviour. As well as staying within the company he also continued to come to my area’s drinks. It came to a head at someone’s leaving drinks when he commented on my dress and at the end of the night he got my on my own, as luckily for him no one else needed the same tube station to go home from. He started talking about how we should go out and how there’s nothing wrong with it (never mind the fact that I did not find him, a man almost twice my age, attractive). I said no. He then ignored this and tried to kiss me. I was horrified. The next day I told my manager, between us we came up with options to handle it. I decided to sit down with him, one-to-one, and talk about what had happened. I explained how uncomfortable it had made me feel and that I had never acted differently towards him than to any other colleague. He apologised profusely and claimed that he needed to reassess his life. I chose that option because it was important to me to stand up for myself and I did not want to see anyone else in my position (I know that I am not the first woman he has behaved this way towards). I chose not to go to HR, partly out of fear for damage to my own career (our HR is known not to be employee-supportive, I couldn’t tell you how to contact them). But also because he is very good at keeping up the persona of being ‘harmless’ and a ‘nice guy’. So much so that one of my male friends who I used to work with and recently told did not take what happened seriously. I now wish that I had been more extreme in acting, as I think that is the only way he would change. Unfortunately from what I hear nothing seems to have changed, although I have moved to a better role still in the same company but luckily in a different office. I do feel stronger for taking control of what happened, although I wish it had never had to happen. "
"i was 23 years-old. My job involved developing high-level contacts and sales prospects. One contact had the potential of providing millions of dollars worth of leads to the company. The contact and I went out to lunch. In his car, he â€œhelpedâ€? me with my seatbelt. In retrospect, I clearly see he was trying to â€œcop a feel.â€? At the time my mental red flag was up, yet, I said nothing as I could alienate this potential partner for an honest mistake. When we were at lunch, I knew this guy was a scum bag when he asked, â€œWas was the age when you lost your virginity?â€? I looked at him, took a second, and said, â€œIâ€™m not comfortable answering that question. This is a business meeting. This lunch is over.â€? Back at the office, I knocked on my bossâ€™s door. I sat down on the other side of his desk, and told him what happened. I ended with, â€œThis guy is a pig. So, if the company continues a relationship with him, I cannot be the contact person.â€? My boss said, â€œThere will be no relationship.â€? My boss having my back was a huge lesson for me about how things should be done. In the personal realm, I had to physically fight off two guys, and endure predatory behavior from others. These guys seemed to view their behavior as part of a game vs totally inappropriate / creepy / predatory. I felt lucky, because I know a vast number of women who were not able to end their attacks. My advice to young women is to be prepared. It is going to happen, what will you do? Iâ€™ve shared versions of these stories with my son, beginning at age 11. I am not raising the creep. "
"I am an artist and a percussionist and since I have started playing hand drums, I encountered condescending attitudes and patronising remarks mostly from men (any background or nationalities) It had been created by the gendering of the instruments itself created by men for millennia. I’m often not taken seriously when I play and I have to deal with flirtations because of assumptions and clichÃ©s around hand drums. My methods of teaching have been slagged off and diminished (basically I have been told that it’s not “properly” played or I have been told: “you are doing it wrong”). I am still learning and I always will be but a lot of men have a lack of pedagogy. With mostly men I have to prove that I can play, I have to impress men with my playing (I don’t do it but it comes across like this). Sexism is not just from men and with women I get competition and jealousy. I have to prove that I can play… “like a man”!!! But thankfully I mostly get support and understanding from women. I teach as well to children and adults (mostly women who feel like it’s difficult to learn from men without being patronised or who are intimidating). Through teaching I am hopefully passing around the fact that it’s about playing and it has nothing to do with their gender. It makes it harder to enjoy it sometimes but I persevere… "
My boss openly and frequently complains about maternity leave. He says it can be the end of small businesses. He also asked me in my first week of working there if I was planning to get pregnant any time soon. 
"I work in a market. A man claimed to be friends with my female boss, and started talking about strong women. He then touched my arm affectionately even though I never met him before. He then talked about how a certain ‘strong’ woman he knew and said how she “would never let a man touch her, like here” and he proceeded to go on to touch me lightly on my thigh. I walked away, I couldn’t believe I didn’t earlier but I feel completely frozen when that happens in social situations: I was worried Id compromise my boss being too rude to this man (when he touched my arm twice) until it was too late. My boss told me later I can tell them where to go, but I feel concerned about how socialized I am to accept this. "
"I work part time and we were due to have a big meeting on one of my pre-arranged days off for the company owner to come and talk to us about a project we just won. My boss asked me to come in, not as part of the team but to make the tea, because that is all I do and the 9 guys in the office could not possibly handle it! If I am not there it is often one of the other girls who is asked despite me delegating to the guy I manage. Unbelievable! "
"At work today I had a difficult customer making a request which I politely denied him, as it was store policy. He proceeded to tell me I was wasting his time, making up my own rules, didn’t know how to do my job, and demanded that I show him the policy in writing before he would believe me. He repeatedly talked over me and refused to accept my responses. My male colleague showed up, says exactly the same thing to him, and immediately the customer calmly accepted his answer and left. "
I have a workmate who always says “sorry girls” after he swears. It feels patronising. He’s in his mid 20s. 
"Today, I was discussing with our finance manager (male, 20 years younger than me, with whom I have had a good business relationship) my decision to take a step back from my full time job and do contract work for the company in the fall due to frustration with how the division I am in is being managed. This way, I get to control what projects I accept, and get some freedom from working under a difficult supervisor. I can afford to do this and it seems a sound way to protect myself from stresses that don’t really need to be affecting my work.This supervisor isn’t going anywhere soon and I have had no success trying to get my point of view across to senior management. He has agreed with me in the past that the current supervisor is alienating good workers and we have lost other good staff because of this. It totally took me aback when he said that my decision is why he has always disliked women managing projects because they quit when the going gets tough. I must have looked at him strangely, as he backed off and said that he always had considered me “one of the guys” because although i was passionate about my work I was never “emotional”. He was disappointed in me because my decision “showed weakness”. I have never heard a sexist word from him before and I would expect someone of his generation to be a little more enlightened. My solution allows me to still work in a job I enjoy and allows the company to still use my skills. Why is this “weak”? Why is being or seeming to be “one of the guys” a good thing, a thing to be desired? Before you assume that I work in a guy-heavy field like tech, I don’t – I work in the child care sector (!!!) "
"I was at work, going for a promotion and – as I was making my way to the board room – a colleague said to me “hey Jules, looking sharp – go get’em tiger”. I felt objectified and miserable, not only had this subhuMAN commented on my appearance instead of my intelligence, but had simultaneously compared my to an animal. An ENDANGERED SPECIES. Needless to say I powered through the misogyny and got the job. I fired the subhuMAN a couple of months later and although he subsequently won an unfair dismissal award from the company, I felt I had done by bit to combat the plague of everyday sexism that women have silently tolerated up until now.

"I work in an open plan office with 3 other companies – most of whom happen to be male. A young woman from the company who supplies art for the walls of the office came in to hang new pictures up. She had a drill and started holes in the wall. A very senior colleague of mine, from the other side of the room, leans back on his chair, stares at her and to the rest of the other dudes in the room, loudly declares how much he ‘loves a woman with a power tool’. Despite mine and other people’s (including the other guys) looks of shock, disgust and embarrassment, he continued, not understanding at all how inappropriate it was. I could see that the poor woman had to keep doing her job but was doing so under the new horrible air of sleaze. It was mortifying. "
"As PhD candidate, when your boss expect you to be there to “help” his MSc students do their projects, without any formal recognition for your work. But your male colleagues are considered co-supervisors for doing similar work for other students.

"Out on site yesterday – met a water company engineer discussing how to fix an underground leak in a mains pipe with a large tree growing within a metre. Out comes a knowledgeable bloke – lived there since the estate was built and the trees planted. Blamed the planners. “It was a lady planner” he said. Pointedly. Just in case we didn’t get the idea, he felt the need to say it again. “It was a lady planner….” Later that day, a colleague asked how my manager did in her recent interview. She got the job. I said we knew she would get the job as she had the best experience. “Because she is a woman” the colleague said. I work in local government and don’t get this very much so I was surprised – enough to write here. I have started to say ‘everyday sexism’ when I hear these normalised sexist comments. So, two yesterday. None yet today… Not much, but since I saw this website, I thought I would add it to the ever expanding log…. "
"Yesterday we (my husband & I, plus a couple of colleagues) were meeting two other men to discuss a business venture. For the second time meeting these men, despite me calling my husband out on it the first time, all other participants gave a summary of their lives & what we were bringing to the table. Again, I was not invited to contribute or discuss my knowledge or expertise (considerable!) to the table. Just a little wifey!! Never mind the 4 languages I speak, the experience in all relevant fields, or the fact that I have built up a considerable amount of the business. FFS – My husband considers himself enlightened! "
"1. When I was in the army, the other guys referred to the only female soldier in our company as a “field mattress” who had only joined the army because she was “too ugly to get any cock” in any arena where the guys had other options. Incidentally, she finished first in the company’s 30 km. march, and when I met her again – quite by accident – a few years later, she was a successful officer and in charge of a company of her own. 2. A coworker at the storehouse where I was employed at the time enjoyed telling women how he liked to fantasize about them while jerking off and openly bragged about keeping a list, ranking his female colleagues by their level of “fuckability”. He could often be heard telling female coworkers things like “You have dropped two places on my list lately. You better lose some weight if you want to regain your position”. As far as I could tell, he never got into any trouble because of his behavior 3. While I was working as a tourist guide in my early thirties an elderly bus driver got a little too “friendly” with an attractive female tourist. While we were making our usual round-trip, he would make nearly twice as many stops as usual, which always ended with him holding his arms tightly around her. Although she didn’t protest, I would be very surprised if she actually enjoyed it. To my shame, I was too much of a coward to intervene. The next day some other male colleagues asked if I had any “success” with “that hot Australian babe”. 4. Same workplace. A colleague ridiculed the idea that “no” to sex should always be taken to mean “no”. He “knew” this because (as he insisted on telling me even if I hadn’t asked him to) he had once shagged a girl who kept yelling “stop”, without heeding her, and afterwards she said it was the best sex she had ever had. Yeah, he truly believed he would always be able to tell a if a woman was feigning lack of consent from a sample size of 1! "
"The other day I was using a paper cutter at my new job and a male coworker I hadn’t met yet came by and said “Watch out there’s a woman with a sharp object.” I thought he was joking so I responded, “Oh ya you better watch yourself or I’ll get you!” “No, I’m serious,” he retorted, “women and sharp objects don’t mix well.” I could not believe he seriously thought this was an appropriate or reasonable statement, and I’d never even met him before! Seriously, that’s the first impression you want to make in the workplace no less? “I think I’ll be just fine,” I responded, “I’ve had ample experience using a paper cutter.” With a hint of sarcasm. I thought these sorts of irrational comments were extinct in the modern workplace, but they clearly aren’t. "

"Bugger Bugger Bugger. I just bloody acted polite when someone in my office sexually harassed me while I made a cup of tea. I work in a large building with lots of different organisations, and the guy next to me at the sink suddenly said “do you know you’re the most attractive girl in the building? I was thinking it the other day. But I’m taken! I’m happily married”. I think my face did the right thing and looked shocked and appalled, but then I heard my mouth say “I suppose I should say thank you”. My only saving grace was that I managed to add “but I have very mixed feelings about you saying that to me” as I left…and heard him saying “I hope you’re not offended!” Gah!! Why didn’t I say what my brain knew was right and tell him “that is unprofessional, inappropriate, offensive and disrespectful to me, your wife, and women in general. Women don’t exist for you to rank in terms of visual appeal, and you reducing me to my physical appearance is belittling. I am a professional woman here in my professional capacity and I think you should seriously reconsider your attitude if you want to be considered a professional too”?

"I’m a ‘good’ man, hopefully this website isn’t aimed at me but some need to be aware that sexism works both ways: ‘you’re a bloke, you can’t be expected to multi-task’ is one I get a lot. What tosh.

"Something that caused enormous destruction in my younger life was the way everyone around me believed lies about me without question, like they wanted to, like they enjoyed it. Friends, friends’ parents & work colleagues believed the slander coming from those males who had sexually abused me. Those males were believed without question. Truly amazing! Apart from being sad and perplexed about why people would shut me down – sometimes very rudely – for apparently no reason at all, I was oblivious about what was going on for years…and then I woke up.

"I believe, and I have noticed many examples of this, that behind every sexist git-bag (from the very worst to the least worst) is a devoted mother whose perception of her son has placed him somewhere in the realm of the gods. He has never been chastised for anything, gets what he wants, usually treats his mother very badly, and quite likely has been watching her shoulder sexism coming from older males all his life. Monkey see – monkey do. "

"I have just seemed to reached a level where I seem to be less tolerant: of everyday sexism. I am over the times I sit in meetings where I know I am the only one interrupted. I am over when a male repeats my ideas that I have just said, but when he says it – it becomes a brilliant idea.I hate it how by remaining silent at a work meeting – seems like the best strategy, to speak out seems to add more demerit points, rather than the males who dominate the airways – who never stop talking. I hate it that my students can never be fantastic because I am their teacher. That in some ways my teaching colours the perception of their work. I have taught students who have won national competitions, but it never seems to be add on to my ability to teach. However, even if a male teacher has not won an award – his student, will no doubt produce fantastic results. "

"My boss routinely dismisses my opinions by saying things like: “let Uncle Ned give you some advice” and “when you disagree with me, you remind me of my daughter”. I have a degree in economics, am 30 and manage 30+ employees, yet he routinely asks me to “pretty up his presentations” and has, on more than one occasion, cited my background in journalism (which is not my background at all) as the reason for my ability to add “flare” to his reports. He also tells me I should smile more. Would you smile if you worked for this man? "
"I have also notice how often women at work interrupt me in meetings. Interrupting anyone is considered rude. I also know that a women said that I was intimidating A COUPLE YEARS BACK. I am tall ,well built, and I have tattoos but I dress in regular work attire jeans and nice shirt at said place of professional work. Said women and I had several H R appointment to hash it it out she did not show all three times. It was excused. It never would have been excused if I had not shown up. In the end it was the one negative point that kept me from getting my raise. My wife was upset and questioned me as to why this women would have it out for me. My boss told me to change everything I am LOLOLO. Not so LOLOL too me. I can’t change that I am male.Sexism works both ways. I also notice women can be crude sexually out on the floor but if a man does it is wrong? I do not get it? Is it only sexism if the women is violated or has a precieved violation. Seriously did not feel my boss, wife or HR department were that concern that I was experiencing sexism. I "
"1. Groped by a 60+ year old man at the age of 12 on a bus for over an hour. I was too scared to say anything but always sat beside a woman after that if I had to travel on my own. I told my aunt about it and she laughed it off. I told my Mom and she was horrified. I was always careful after that about travelling on public transport! 2. Boss at a retail job in my teens would rub up against me in the stock room, ‘accidentally, but intentionally.’ He was gross! 3.I was Groped by a guy in a nightclub when I went to sit down on a chair aged 21. He ‘grabbed me by the p*****’ in the words of DJ Trump. I threw a beer in his face and walked away. It was disgusting beyond belief! 4. I was sexually assaulted by a GP IN my very early 20s during a medical examination and asked me was I a virgin. I was too naive and innocent at the time to see what the guy was actually doing. I never went back to him. I wish I had reported him!!! 5.I was whacked on the backside in my 20s by a freelance guy passing the printer, who was just back from a boozy lunch, which I reported to my boss immediately and said I could take a case against this guy. I didn’t! 6.At an office party one night, a boss commented on my ‘attractiveness’ but that I didn’t give out many ‘invitations’. We all knew he had slept with at least 2 women in the office that I know of. He later apologised for his drunken comment. 7. Lewd comments from another boss in my mid-30s after a business trip about how exhausted he was after all the ‘sex’ we had away. (We most certainly didn’t btw). He said it in front of my male colleague who was very shocked by the language. This boss constantly stared at me while I worked and talked about sex with his wife, his wife’s underwear and referred to female clients in a disgusting way. I pulled him up on it and he stopped it. I left the job after a few months. Another time, SAME GUY,, I was on the phone pitching to a VP of a large company in the US. He grabs one of his female codirectors, pulls her on to chair with him and starts groping her and tickling her. She lets our a squel and laughs along. It was unreal!! And I’m trying to do my job where my.numbers are being monitored by this overgrown pubescent manchild. What was worse was a female co-director made light of his gross comments. I needed the job or I would have left before that! He was the vilest, sexist narcissist who treated his staff like crap! I am not exaggerating any of this either! 8. One guy I dated in last year forced himself on me kissing me on the first date as we were saying good night as I was telling him I didn’t see us together which he replied ‘so you’re dumping me.’ It was gross! I never saw him again. I had decided during dinner I wasn’t going to see him again. Fortunately I’m strong in myself that I don’t take any lewd comments, behaviour or on water advances. In writing these down it’s made me realise how much I passed this off or forgot about all these events as just things that happened. I am not a flirtatious type at all. I weare modest attire. My only regret it I was way too friendly and nice about these experiences. I’m older now and I don’t take any of it any more! Thank you for putting this website up! "
"I went to an all girls high school so was lucky enough to escape the sexism and intimidation which seems rife at many mixed sex schools. I grew up feeling confident giving my opinion and answering questions in class without fear of retribution or ridicule. I left school (naively) believing that I was equal to my male counterparts and that opportunities and courtesies afforded to them would be extended to me. Imagine my shock on entering the workplace to discover that giving my opinion and making decisions was regularly met with derision, ridicule, and even on occasion, retribution. My first (male) boss went out of his way to patronise me and put me down in meetings in front of other colleagues. He told me I was “too bolshy” and thought I had “ideas above my station” and “needed bringing down a peg or two”. I had not experienced anything like this before and did not take well to being bullied: instead of making me quiet like he had hoped it made me react aggressively. I thought maybe for a while that maybe I was making too much of it but sometimes other colleagues would come up to me after meetings and ask me how I put up with him etc., so I knew it wasn’t all in my head. He got worse and I felt really bullied and started to get a bit depressed. I finally complained to the (male) boss of the department but they were on his side and said I needed to learn to accept authority and respect my boss. This is what you get for being a confident woman in the workplace. My next male boss insisted on calling me “love” all the time, which made me feel like a foolish schoolgirl. I was 32 and a project manager for a major management consultancy firm. I never told him how much it irritated me as I was just pleased that after my last horrible boss, at least he was being nice to me. Just like other women have written, I have many examples or being abused or having sexual advances or names called in the street, but to be honest, it happens so often and just seems to be the way of life, and I can’t pick out any in particular.

"I was giving the police a video interview about historical serious sex abuse. A male officer was asking the questions and a young woman PC was dealing with the filming technology. It was 2006. North London. When we finished and I was preparing to leave the older higjer-ranking male made a number of sexist remarks to the younger officer such as ” you’re better off in the kitchen where women belong”. She just smiled and said nothing. It was so incongruous and inappropriate, it was impossible to know how to deal with it but it was never forgotten. "
I was a Civil engineer – I worked in 3 companies where I experienced not only sexual comments on what I (and fellow women) wore but I also experienced being placed in a secretarial role – often being told to write meeting notes or organise Christmas parties. The worst part was that I experienced the most frequent sexism in a company (AECOM) that has won awards for positively including women in the workplace. Whilst working there this meant sending an email on international women’a day (which I was ridiculed for in my team) but also introduced a mentoring scheme for women which was then cancelled despite me volunteering for being mentored and mentoring myself. 
"I recently got chartered as a civil engineer at the Institute of Civil Engineering. I won’t get into the backward industry that is engineering but having continued that battle and receiving a qualification that I worked so hard for, I received an overwhelming amount of sexism at the institute itself. On the day, despite being dressed in smart attire (and a name badge, with my title on it!), I was ignored for a survey for engineers, I was constantly asked if I was my colleague’s girlfriend. This was after I’d been carrying my certification. The institute claims to support women but in my ten years of being a member, I’ve felt actively excluded by a group that is predominantly made up of white, middle aged men. "
"I am about to write about my uncomfortable and sometimes shameful memories. Ouch. ðŸ™? From about 4-14: Cousin tried to molest me and did molest my twin sister. The old landlord forced us to sit on his lap if we wanted to ride our bikes and this happened until our breasts developed and we started refusing. Our mother had more sexual experiences with him than we did, but she felt it was harmless. At 16: My twin sister and I were verbally accosted while getting candy at a small store by two men in the aisle. At 17: Was asked by four men at a table if I like to “party”. I did not know what that meant and said “sometimes”. My male friend (who was in the group below) had to tell me what it meant. At 17: Three friends were joking about my having sex with one of them because we were both virgins. I thought they were kidding and even wrote in the guy’s yearbook that it would be fun. Huge mistake. They set-up the whole thing for this guy and attempted to rape me. When I went to the cops, I was told I should not have been over at my friend’s house and boys will be boys. At 17: After the event with those “friends”, I was hit on by a coworker who was 23. He wanted to have sex with me because I was a virgin and his wife was not when they married. I did not want to have sex with him, and never did anything, but I did accept the attention for too long. At 21: The first time I had sex was with someone I did not love. I was tired of everyone finding out I was a virgin and targeting me because of it. I wanted it gone. I chose terribly. Right in the middle of this intimate and painful experience, he tells me that he wants to do me in the butt. I asked if he could please focus on what we’re doing and he said that I wasn’t good at it and he thought I should sleep with a few of his friends and get better and come back to him. At 22: Was about to get sexual with a date when, as I’m naked, he grabs my face and shoves it into his pillow and attempts to take me hard from behind while holding my face down. I had to shove him off of me. Then I got the hell out of there. At 25: I dated a much older man on and off after turning 21 after having my terrible virginity sex. He was 38. Years of on and off dating and he apparently told my cousin’s husband, his friend, about our sex life. My cousin’s husband (they were divorcing) called and wanted me to hang out in his hot tub with him. At 27: Got a job where we got snowed in. One coworker, who already had a wife and mistress, wanted me for his second mistress. He trapped me in a corner and was telling me his favorite sexual position. At 27-28: Got a different job where I was hired because I was a blonde (boss was into Hitler, I found out). I was sexually harassed and physically bullied by two men. Over a year of their behavior, someone (not me) turned them in. I had dates and everything documented. They just said they didn’t do it. Despite witnesses, the “investigation” that was done was crap and I was told that my “story could not be substantiated”. One man had a record of sexual harassment and the other pushed me up against a wall in front of my boss. A coworker told me about his interview (he and I were mid-conversation when the one man smacked my ass and I just ran out of the room). He said the interviewer asked about the ass-smacking and he said he saw it and she said, if we were talking, then how could he see it? Did he physically see the man’s hand on my ass? He knew it by my body movement he said and she retorted that he could have hit my back and that he wasn’t really a witness to anything. I was persecuted for turning them in (which I did not do) and nothing happened to either of them. At 28-29: Had an administrative job where I worked with two men. The one was always making weird comments. Example: A man helped me with some project and I said thank you, to which this other man said, “You know he’s married, right?” in front of me and the man I thanked. I said yes, I knew, so what and he said that I didn’t need to flirt with him. He was always saying things like that. At 26-30: Had a boyfriend who always criticized me when I wanted to take a shower or get makeup on. He always wanted to know who I was trying to impress (we lived in a terrible, in the middle of nowhere place). He also criticized me sexually because he did not like that I got wet and he would throw a towel at me for it (and we hardly ever had sex). At 29: Went on a job interview where the man asked me if I was single, had children, lived nearby, or if I could find an apartment nearby he could visit. When I told him he should not be asking me that and his wife probably would not appreciate it, he told me they weren’t looking for anyone and I could see myself out. At 17-32: In the workplace, random men are always commenting on what I should or should not do with my hair, fingernails, weight, clothes, etc. At 32: In truth, working actually terrifies me because I am timid and I have a hard time (almost an impossibility, really) in standing up to men. They frighten me a great deal. The saddest part, for me, is that for the first time in my life, at 32, I have started to feel SAFE. I have finally found the guy I used to daydream about as a little girl. It makes me wish I met him before any of those negative things happened at all because they certainly have left an imprint on me. But he, too, feels that I am not that safe with men and he worries about me. I wish I was stronger and more assertive, but I don’t feel I should have to change who I am. "
"Small thing but still infuriating…. I was cleaning showcase glass in the gallery I work at. A male contractor walks past with his pal and shouts ‘good job love. You’ll make a fantastic housewife one day!!’ Another occasion I was asked to supervise some evening filming and that I was to be there in a management capacity and that the filming would take place under my direction. However, the building contractor who was also there that night decided I was there because ‘they’ve sent over a pretty face to keep the lads entertained this evening’ And just yesterday when I was carrying a drill through the gallery I had, ‘you look the part, but I bet you don’5 know how to use it!’ – of course I bloody do. I use one everyday! The worst thing is that on these occasions, and on many others, I’ve responded with the polite laugh or smile that is expected of me because it’s just easier and I don’t want to be told I take myself too seriously/ need to lighten up/ can’t take a joke, which means that I’m a part of the problem.

"I saw Laura talking on Ted Talks on You-tube and while she was talking and stating that this happens to all women, I sat thinking well that has never happened to me I must be the lucky one…. However, after sitting for a while and thinking hard about my life and experiences, the truth is actually I’m just another woman in a long line of women who has had this my entire life from the comments of ‘women cant drive’ to a co-worker at my office staring at my chest whilst having a conversation with me and when confronted about why he wasn’t talking to me with eye contact he said…. well they are lovely. To which I admit I replied in a moment of bravery, ‘yes they are but they are mine and not yours to ogle at as you please so I suggest you look up.’ One of the worst blatant forms of it I have ever received was when working for a supermarket I was working to become a manager and alongside 4 men I received training etc. I received top marks in my group always and told repeatedly by the trainer (a woman I might add) that I was the leader of the class and I was a natural at it. However, at the time the company was having a big drive around ‘women in the workplace’ and how as women we can be mothers and have a career and do it all, so all my hard work and talent meant nothing to the men I worked with ‘YOUR ONLY HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A VAGINA’ they turned my hard work and talent into a statistic and sadly I left that career and didn’t make it to manager because I felt like I wasn’t good enough and never reported the incidents. Looking back now that was my mistake but we as women are so programmed to accept these actions and treat them as normal and its not ok. "
"I started working in a new place at the beginning of August. and I share an office with two men. Every day since I got here, when I arrive in the office one of the men looks me up and down when he greets me. I tried to make a joking reference about this early on to draw his attention to it, but I don’t think he got what I was saying and so he didn’t really respond. More days passed and I have been getting increasingly angry every day when he looks me over like that. Today he did it again and I said ‘You still look people up and down when you greet them?’ This time he listened up and said, well where should I look? And I said, at my face! So he said, why? And I said, because it’s sexist! And then he got angry and said that there are different ways of greeting (implying different cultures) and that I was being way too aggressive. So now it’s as though it has become a race or culture issue because I am white and he is black. I apologised for perhaps being too aggressive in the way I broached it, but I also said that I’m not apologising for speaking up because women have the experience of being objectified all the time and it really sucks. But now he won’t talk to me and I think I have just made our office life very much more unpleasant. And who knows, maybe it’s true that in his home community no women experience being looked up and down as objectifying and unpleasant. I don’t know. Maybe my tactical error was to use the word ‘sexist’ which immediately sounds accusing and it is difficult to come back to a neutral place from that. But, on the other hand, why must I put up with something that made me feel uncomfortable every day? What an unpleasant situation overall. ðŸ™? "
"In the late 80’s I worked for Red Lobster in San Diego. I was refused a raise the male bussers got because I “couldn’t lift as much weight as the men.” At the time, I was training for a national martial arts competition. Trust me. I could lift as much weight as the men. "
"Today, at work, we were talking about who asked out who, and if we’d rather be asked or ask. I’ve said I don’t need to wait a guy to ask me out, I can do it by myself (it’s not a rule, it can happen, it cannot, it depends on the situation). The answer was: you’re pretty, you don’t need to do that. When I tried to encourage the others women on the table to do the same the answer was: you’re pretty, so you’ll probably never be rejected, so that’s why you do that. "
"Yesterday, a colleague and I (both late 20s/early 30s female) conducted an audit in our workplace, auditing a colleague in another department. We had to stop the audit part way through because he was so aggressive and hostile, claiming that we didn’t know what we were talking about and we had no right to question him. Ironically, we are the two most qualified and experienced auditors in our company. Both with advanced degrees. We’ve both conducted hundreds of audits each, including on construction sites and waste processing plants. Neither of us have ever had to stop an audit part way through for any reason, let alone being aggressively told we don’t know what we’re doing. We are both just so disappointed that a colleague would treat us this way. And angry. So very angry. "
"I attended a private Christian school elementary-high school. My junior year of high school (2011) I was being harassed by another student. He would make inappropriate comments, grope me in the hall or anytime possible, he would corner me and grab my butt, and send me pictures that I did not ask for. It started happening more and more and I asked him to stop and he would just laugh and continue. I was terrified of him and what my friends would think if they knew. I finally told my parents and they immediately told the head master of the school. I was so ready to have this issue resolved, but instead I was told that it was my fault. The administrators of my school said I was lying that he would never do that, and if he did do then I must have provoked it. I was humiliated.. 2 years later in my workplace it started again with a different guy. I began to wonder if maybe it was my fault. This time I was too scared to say anything fearful that it would be blamed on me yet again. When my boss found out he took the appropriate measures and fired the guy harassing me. My boss made sure I knew that his behavior was not okay and I really appreciated that. I am so tired of women being blamed, it’s not our fault. "

"I worked for a London company with a lot of older sales guys, some would drink in the lunchtime, they called me a lesbian as I didnt have a boyfriend and one called me a prostitute for no reason I can fathom except that he was always drunk in the lunchtimes and he was abusive and toxic, they made sexual jokes all the time and I didnt leave as I was scared and had to pay my rent which was high and I was quite new to the corporate world, so vunerable, looking back I wish I had left years ago when the comments started, although I would now never put myself in that situation, they also didnt pay me for new client accounts that I brought into the company.

"My printer at work ran out of printer paper today, so I went to get some more. I got an entire box(I think it has about 5 packs of printer paper in it) and had to bring it up one flight of stairs to my desk. Just as I approached the stairs, one of my managers passed me and offered to carry it for me. I politely declined as I had no problems carrying the box. I don’t have an issue with someone offering to help me, but what irks me is that I know if it had been one of the guys carrying the box, the manager would never have offered to carry it for them. I’ve also had a similar issue at work, but where the sexism actually came from another female. I had to lift something that was a bit heavy, but I had no problems carrying it, when my female colleague rushed up to me and said I should have asked for help. She never would have said the same to one of the guys. "
"ADVISE FOR WOMEN: AVOID TECH IF YOU WANT TO SAY HEALTHY AND HAPPY Although I proved myself capable in computer science academically, gaining a PhD cum laude in a technology field, an MSc with Distinction in Computer Science with a prize for excellence, and numerous other professional qualifications…(I was good at Maths at school too! obviously)…after six months in my first software developer role I was forced to leave due to blatant misogyny, which included rape jokes, porn pop ups on my screen only, having my work mysteriously deleted from the shared drive when management asked for it. At review time, I was told by management that they weren’t sure if “I was any good” and refused the raise discussed at hire on that principle and on the fact that the one other woman in the team had walked out a couple of weeks previously claiming bullying and they’d “already had their fingers burnt”! I scored a small win by handing in my notice the following morning, but, terrified, they reneged and gave me the raise. Unfortunately, after thinking it over for a week or two, I realised that there was no way I could stay in that job and remain well. The other lady who had finally walked out (who wrote some wonderful code I noticed) had gone deaf in her time at the company! The department sang “ding dong the witch is dead” the day after she walked. After another go in development with a different company, I was immediately put on part-time and low wages, and again isolated as well as sidelined into administrative duties. The boss had me labelled ‘secretary’ on the organisational plan on the corporate intranet. Overwhelmingly disheartened, I gave up the years of study and regretted the thousands and thousands of pounds I personally spent on building career and…not even sure what… I would advise women and girls to stay away from Tech in the early 21st century as it is macho, hostile and aggressive, and no matter how good of an imitation of men you can muster up, you will NEVER be welcome. If you are competent, you will be disliked enough to be forced/tricked into making mistakes and appearing incompetent by isolation and bullying. If you are a beginner and have thus not yet reached competency or near it, your questions and pleas for help will be proving the belief that ‘women are no good at science’ to the woman-haters on a daily basis so everyone will be happy and no one will do anything to help you progress. Eventually you will suffer from imposter syndrome and stereotype threat and could very well become ill. Tech is something I really enjoy and believe I could excel at in the same ways I excelled everywhere else in life when I didn’t have to fight against prejudice and a belief from all around me that I was “no good”. This is pure evil. Ironically, the boss at my first job is now in prison for life for a premeditated murder in cold blood of an unknown-to-him woman. "
"Most guys I know in one way or another have made some implicit sexual comments, and it has made me realize that it does not matter too much about a man’s education or background it still does not stop them from making inappropriate remarks. I was working in a group at university with 3 other guys (not intentional the lecturer put us into groups). Of course you get the backhand of the guy banter, the random comments. This one guy who is particularly vocal asks me to invite another guy to join our study group and says why don’t you use your womanly charms? You know what I mean….. So I am so use to all this lad culture now that I have completely stopped giving a shit about what comes out of my mouth. I reply something which is obviously beyond polite and he all of a sudden comments that that is disgusting and why would I say that. It was even that bad. This just highlighted to me that there are such double standards in this respect. I am not a supporter of lad culture or the derogatory language that comes along with it, but deal it straight back and them and they often can’t hack it. Pathetic if you ask me… "
"After finishing my degree at university and a few months work experience I landed my first full time job at a small company, working in my field of study. It seemed like a dream job, exactly the start I needed to go on to build my career. I say this as background information so you might understand why I endured and often did my best to ignore the behaviour of some of my colleagues. I was for a time the sole female employee at the small company. Later there were one or two more female employees, but always in extreme minority to the male employees. They still have a ratio of around 10:1 male to female employees, despite the business being in design, which at degree stage is female dominated. Friday mornings were designated time for male employees to search around the internet for images of topless/naked women, collect them together and email them around to each other. This practice was largely led and encouraged by the head of the company. I was once sent the email by mistake, for which I did not really receive an apology. Also they would refer to the email in code: “Have you got those Top Tobs ready for me yet?” TOBs was very clever code for Tig Ol’ Bitties as they would sometimes refer to it (Big Ol’ Titties), surely too clever a code for a mere female to understand? Every Friday until at least lunchtime I would see the screens of some of my colleagues filled with pictures of naked women as I attempted to continue my work in a professional manner to ensure that we made our deadline, often having to stay late at the office because my colleagues lost half a day of work this way. Company events, such as the christmas party, would occasionally end up with the male employees visiting strip clubs, all on the company expenses; female employees were never invited of course. These examples stand as some of the more overt expressions of the deeply ingrained misogyny present within that place of work. My advice to anyone who becomes aware of this sort of behaviour is to leave immediately and never look back. It is a solid indicator that you will never receive equal pay or have a chance to advance your career if you are a woman and your employers deem these acceptable behaviours for a workplace. I only wish I had realised this sooner myself but, being young and naive, I gave far too much benefit of the doubt. "
I was working at a day hospital that only has emergency clinics available after hours. We have the sexual assault clinic there. A patient came in and the nurse that was on call was taking longer than expected. Being a rape victim myself. I tried to give her space but support her. She sat in a room with a friend of hers. My partner (male) said to me “i bet they went out drinking last night”. This is exactly whats wrong with society. Rape culture. Labelling her and assuming she was drinking. Unbelievable. 
"Work woes, male colleagues take your ideas and glorify them as their own, thought I could trust without a second thought as we chat/banter about ideas – but lo and behold in a formal setting in front of all – they build on your ideas as if you don’t exist. I find this really petty and outdated. The sad thing is I have lost trust as an open person,these guys they just want the ‘badges’ and to look good. "
The ‘unisex’ protective clothing I have to wear at work only comes in men’s sizes. And they say there are no barriers to women in the workplace any more … 
"One office I worked in with around 6/7 other people at the time, all of them male. On one occasion a client (male) came to our office and was invited to sit and talk business with my boss in the ‘meeting room’ which was just behind a partition wall in the open plan space. Client proceeded to tell a very lewd story to my boss about some girl he had spent the night with and throw out afterwards (quite some nasty details), until at some point (I think) my boss says quietly something about there being women around. The client proceeds to walk around the partition wall, walk up behind me as I’m at my computer trying to continue my work in a professional manner but extremely angry that I have to listen to disgusting stories from a stranger in my place of work. He puts his hand onto my shoulder and says: I’m sorry, I didn’t know there would be girls here.” He is joking and enjoying himself, not a genuine apology. I had to choke every impulse to throw his sweaty hand from my skin in revulsion and swallow my disgust to tell him: Yeah, ok” or something, because he is a client and I think I can’t be rude. Nobody did or said anything else about it. What? You didn’t think there would be women at a workplace? The same workplace used to have email sent around every Friday from several guys in the office (and from the boss and in particular encouraged by the boss) which had a lot of pictures of topless women in it. They called it Top Tobs (Tobs was their “code” for Tig Ol’ Bitties’ which they would sometimes reference out loud, thinking what? i didn’t get the brilliant code? I was sent the email once by mistake, which did not really result in an apology, but every Friday until at least lunchtime I could see my colleagues scrolling through these pictures and also searching the web for their own batch to send around. Why did I continue to work at this place? I had struggled, as many young people do, to get my foot in the door of my chosen career and was young and naive enough to think that it would be possible for me to begin to build a career from having a job in this place. Big mistake – let me tell you! If you see these warning signs of ingrained misogyny in your place of work, get out of there! There is no hope for fair pay or equal opportunities in this case and the best thing is to move on. I would dearly love to name and shame the place in question, but it would be unfair to the people working there who were decent people, and be sure that those who deserve it will reap the rewards of their behaviour by themselves in the end.

"where do I start? my female babysitter who sexually abused my sister and I when we were young? my inappropriate uncle who used to sit me on his lap when it was no longer age-appropriate to do so? Being yelled at and whistled at in the street – for basically my whole life since I was about 13 being sexually assaulted in university having my breasts grabbed by men in nightclubs, or the ones who rub their groin against my ass when I am just trying to dance the guy on the bus who looked up my skirt as i climbed the stairs a few weeks ago, a guy in his car who passed me in the street and honked his horn and leaned out the window to yell remarks at me and when I ignored him, u-turned in the middle of the street to drive past me again, this time actually pulling up onto the sidewalk to block my path and nearly run me over Being told to smile or look happy when I am not being told I am angry and riled up and bent or raging – when really I am having a passionate political conversation. even the more subtle things… like when I consented to sleep with a man using a condom, and he took it off without my knowledge. or when i was so drunk, a man followed me home and tried to sleep with me and insisted he was “getting me home safe” – I tried to get him to leave me alone but I guess he came inside the house… the last thing I remember was passing out, and I woke up naked with a condom wrapper on the floor and no man to be seen. how is that consent?? a group of guys took a secret photo of me on the tube and I caught them and called them out, and then they all jeered at me, saying they wouldn’t take my photo because I was too fat. but they did, because I saw them. or the guy on the tube that I was chatting to, he seemed normal and friendly, and then before he go off at his stop, he reached over and put his hand on my knee, under the hem of my skirt. it was intimidating and creepy and happened so fast i didn’t even think to slap him away. I hate feeling afraid that if i reject a guys advances, he will turn around and call me ugly or fat. i hate the intimidation and lack of control. i hate that to get a guy to leave me alone, i have to sometimes lie and say I have a boyfriend. why can’t my NO be enough? but the threat of another man is? I am paid significantly less than my male colleagues for doing the same job maybe I should have made each of these stories a separate submission? when I try to remember them all, it’s overwhelming. I feel so depressed and discouraged that things will never change. that women will always be valued for what they look like more than anything else. and i am so afraid to grow old and lose my worth in the eyes of society. i am so afraid that (I am in my 30s) i won’t end up with a family and soon I won’t be able to have kids and between that and my age and appearance, I will be completely worthless. rationally i know that isn’t true – but emotionally i feel exhausted. can’t i just exist? why do i have to worry about being smooth and hairless and skinny but with impossibly big breasts and a perfect vagina all the time? not to mention dressed impeccably and smelling lovely. I AM SICK OF IT. "
"There’s a too many events to list them all so instead I’ll pick out a few that have never left me and still come to mind regularly; – Coming downstairs one day when my dad’s lawyer and family friend was visiting the house. I was in my nightie. He lifted up my nightie and spanked my bottom calling me a ‘naughty girl’ for not wearing knickers. I was 8. My dad was watching. I cried and nothing was said. I ran upstairs and in my family the event was never mentioned again, the lawyer still continued to come round regularly. I always wore trousers. – I was 11 and had started to develop breasts before most of my peers, in trampoline club the teacher put his arm across your chest to support you while you learnt to flip. When it was my turn he avoided touching my chest and put his arm across my belly instead, I wasn’t properly supported by that hold and fell. It gave me very mixed signals about my body; that it was something shameful. – I was 12 and was at Proms in the Park with my dad and brother. We had a picnic blanket near the back. I walked around and went to the front nearer the stage. A man exposed himself to me and tried to grab my hand to make me touch his penis. I ran crying back to the blanket, no one asked why I was in tears. I was told I was ‘attention seeking’. – I was 14 and working in the village pub. My boss would regularly either walk behind me at the bar and brush inappropriately against me or if I walked behind him he would pretend to jump and tell all the customers I’d pinched his bottom because I fancied him. I went home crying from every shift. I told my dad, he did nothing. – I was 15 and a group of friends and I went to London to see a show. We were getting the tube back to Waterloo to get the train home and on the escalator a man put his hand up my skirt and grabbed me so hard I was bruised down there. My friend’s (mostly male, we were a group of 4 boys and 2 girls) didn’t believe me. My dad told me not to wear skirts in cities. – Aged 16-18 I got the train to college everyday. It was always just 6th form students and commuters on my train. The stares of the 50+ aged men as they walked along the train aisles or stood over me on the train always made me feel dirty before it was even 8am. – Aged 19 I was assaulted by a man while backpacking. These are just some of the events that have stood out to me. There are too many to list them all; every cat-calling, bum-groping, inappropriate stare, time I’ve been followed home or messages I have received online. Those things have blended into ‘normal’ life and part of what I expect (if not accept) as a woman. "
"Iâ€™ve recently finished working on a project on which I felt I was treated pretty badly – professionally and creatively disrespected and excluded by two colleagues I had been led to believe I would be on a par with when I took the job. Â Towards the end, in particular, it began to feel personal. Â I became very confused about the situation – I genuinely couldnâ€™t work out what the problem was and couldnâ€™t think of anything Iâ€™d done to warrant the situation. When I finished the job, I went to my boss to ask for some feedback in the hope that he might be able to shed some light on things – I wondered, for example, if anything had been said when I wasnâ€™t around. Â He said he was dismayed about the way my colleagues had behaved and reassured me that nothing had been said behind my back. Â He seemed to be genuinely struggling to come up with an explanation. But one suggestion he did make was that they could be misogynistic. Â It was said very matter-of-factly – offered as a plausible or rational justification. Moreover, it was followed by a full stop – not by an undertaking to do anything, to talk to them about it, or even an acknowledgement that, if indeed that was the reason, it wouldnâ€™t be okay.Â  Btw – I work in the media.

"A very close family friend had gotten me a job as a nanny, at a family whose grandmother she knew. I greatfully took the job and moved in with the family, in a house on the gold coast of ZÃ¼rich. The mother worked abroad so I never really saw her but the dad was there every day. His name was Claudio. The couple had two children named Carla (2) and Simon (5). I got along very well with the children but the father from the first day started making inappropriate advances towards me and making little comments about my looks that made me very uncomfortable. At first I thought it was just because he was a bit awkward and so I tried to ignore it. However it kept getting worse. He would say things like :”I sleepwalk so if you wake up and I’m in your room don’t be surprised”. After that I asked for a key to my room but he couldn’t find it. At that point I was afraid and wasn’t sleeping anymore cause I was worried he would come in uninvited. On weekends when I went back home I cried a lot and my boyfriend kept telling me to quit, but I was so ashamed to not only let down that family friend but also the kids and my parents. Finally I decided to quit. However to my surprise thee next day the mother came home early and told me, that her husband Claudio was no longer comfortable with me working at his house. He said that he thought I was badly raised and therefor also very unfriendly towards him. I was offended and shocked and so I said nothing and left. It’s been weeks now and I have a new job and my parents told me that I in no way have disappointed them and that they are glad I am no longer there, but I still am not sleeping right because I still think of it all the time. I hate what he has done to me and how Claudio made feel so powerless and vulnerable. I feel bad for whoever takes that job after me. "
"Made a suggestion for direction of my work stream in a large restructure project, a suggestion that protected jobs and boosted morale while also reducing the workload and stress for the project. The two middle aged project leads dismissed it to my face then a few days later promoted it to the whole project as ‘their’ great idea with no hint of acknowledging that it came from me. I am mid-thirties but possibly could be thought to be younger (based on previous response to my age), blonde and female and therefore get less respect, there are males my age on the project who get much more respect and it is obvious.

"The place where I work is poorly run by means of taking time off. If you want so much as a weekend off, you’d better ask for it months in advance because our managers are dicks. So I did that.

"I am a high school teacher and I have a small online presence in the feminist community (very small) a post I wrote about Trump’s comments about women and assault must have been picked up by another site and traced back to me because I started to receive death threats and rape threats on my Instagram account. The post went from having close to 100 likes and few shares on Facebook and only 16 likes on Instagram to having 125 comments on Instagram within an hour after one troll posted that I was “a fucking fat feminist that should die” some of my students saw this post and started to defend me. (My account was public, but I never sought out their following or followed them) I began deleting comments and blocking all the profiles leaving comments so I could make the account private. Some of the comments had poetry about how I would be raped, some were “normal” comments a feminist post usually receives; make me a sandwich, get back to the kitchen, wage gap is fake, women will always be second class, etc. But one said some pretty explicit things, using words like cunt, rape, and kill. This user claimed to be sitting in my classroom. "
"On the DC metro, an employee started calling out to me in the train. I ignored him. He became more aggressive. I pulled out my cell phone to make a video, being as discrete as possible. He said: “you taking a video?” and started threatening to hit the phone out of my hand if I didn’t stop. I reported this to the station manager, who couldn’t find any metro transit police, so he told me to call a number. Then another number. Then that guy said his manager would come take a report in person. He didn’t. So the guy said to send the video. I sent it. He told me the harasser was a train supervisor. Then he told me to call another number (during business hours– it was now 8pm). I never did, because I never had time during business hours and because I was shocked that the worst that would happen to this supervisor, is that he’d spend a day learning about customer relations, possibly a day of suspension. And nothing else. Nothing. I was expecting he’d be fired. This 6-foot-something guy was threatening to hit me !! Only reason he didn’t, was that his buddy was standing next to him, and because I was making a video. "
I was turned down from a job as a glass collector at JJ Whispers because I am a female and apparently it’s a male job. 
"I have been working at my workplace for nearly two years, and have dealt with a lot of harassment in my time. When I first started, I got the attention of one of the chefs, who has a wife and little kid. He added me on Facebook and then continued to ask me to send him dirty pics/meet up with him for ‘a fun time’. I was so disgusted that he firstly thought I was interested, and secondly thought I was an easy time. The other person I experienced harassment from was the restaurant manager. He was a friendly guy, but overstepped the boundaries many times by asking me out (he is my father’s age) and slapped me on the ass. I let it continue to happen for over a year and a half, because I was too scared to say anything, as I could potentially be fired wince he was quite well-protected in the establishment, as he had been there many years… But one day a few months ago I had enough, and decided I had to say something to the new boss that had started up at the establishment. I was so overwhelmed and in tears from it all that I could hardly speak, and had to go home and write up a formal letter to send to him. Thankfully, the new boss got him fired, but it still makes me shudder thinking about what may have happened if I hadn’t spoken up… "
"I was promoted to help train the international helpdesk of a magic circle firm in the UK. When I wandered past a group of men in my team after my promotion was announced they made loud comments such as “well she must be fucking someone upstairs”, “perhaps I’d get a promotion if I grew a set of tits” and “what a fucking joke”. No, sorry gentlemen but it was because I turned up on time, made the effort to wear a suit, acted professional, worked overtime, kept my head down, didn’t moan, got the job done, made an effort to help people, made the effort to learn what I didn’t know in my own time, communicated with other teams and staff and because at times I was better at my job because I simply worked harder. Sadly it was a vile career experience. It got to the point I decided to resign. Ultimately I also made the decision to leave technology as did some other women I worked with. Sadly such experiences seem to be commonplace in the UK. I gave my agency notice just prior to taking a two-week holiday to avoid any further nastiness. The attacks and undermining were just exhausting. Sadly there were a handful of girls who seemed to make the decision to join the status quo and it is only some years later that I realise this was simply a sad effort for these minority of weak-women to try to get ahead by bowing to the sexist and bullying status-quo that existed at the firm. After verbally confirming my resignation and how to minimise the fallout, I then confirmed this in an email to my agency, the firm’s response (via the employment agency)and was then to send me a letter in the post saying my position had been terminated. I wasn’t given any work in the remainder of my time with the firm and everyone was told I’d been sacked. It was surreal, very nasty and unprofessional and seemed purposely nasty. Bizarrely, I then got a phone call four weeks later asking if I’d like to work for the firm again as they had decided they would now like me to return. (Whaaaat?) Like many other capable women who leave technology because of the issue of sexist undermining I politely said er, no thanks to both the agency and the firm. It seems my leaving had indirectly triggered a series of other resignations. So if you’re reading this and you’re a professional wondering why you’re getting an mediocre IT service at your company, perhaps it’s time you emailed your line manager/section head/CEO/CIO. Simply asking the key strategists what official and unofficial procedures they have put in place to ensure that the best possible staff are supported in roles that in turn help the jobs that bring in income would no doubt reinforce the importance of logical business needs. The signs of a cowboy service are usually pretty obvious to those affected. Sexism isn’t the only issue of course but it’s likely often 50% of the problem. Both men and women need to demand better in their UK workplaces and to demand and ensure that there are both formal and informal channels in which such behaviour can be addressed. If the problem is institutionalised then informal cross-company inter-departmental mentoring policies would help address such issues. "
"Last summer, when I was 18, I undertook a work placement. On this work placement I was placed with a partner, who was a 31 year old man. I had no issues with this whatsoever, I like to see the best in people, I was there to learn about the business and as the uniform was cargo pants and a baggy polo top, I didn’t feel as though I would even be leading him on (and, as I write, I realise how sad it is that I had to worry about not leading him on…). Everything was OK until we were on our way to an office we had to go to. On the way to this office, we had to ascend several flights of stairs. I was walking up the stairs ahead of him and he decided to comment “I’ll try not to look at your arse as we go up”. As soon as he said that my skin felt on fire. I felt so uncomfortable but I felt like I couldn’t even say anything. It was horrible. By this point I’d learned that he had a young daughter. I thought he’d be more respectful to me than that. In the same placement, there was another man (we’ll call him guyB) who worked the same job as the guy I was partnered with (we’ll call him guyA). GuyA and I spent a lot of time in a van travelling to various places, and so guyA took a lot of calls in his van, which I was around to hear as he’d have them on loudspeaker. I hadn’t really interacted with guyB at all, as I was spending the majority of my time with guyA in this placement. Any conversation I had had with guyB were merely pleasantries in the morning and evening. Anyway, guyA took a call in the van one day, and guyB was at the other end of the phone. GuyA greeted guyB, and guyB responded “I’m alright, how’s you? How’s that bitch?” ‘That bitch’, being myself. I was shocked. I’d barely spoken to this man and he thought it was ok to call me such a derogatory term. I’d barely spoken to guyB too. GuyB also didn’t know that he was on loudspeaker at the time too so he thought that the exchange would only have been heard by himself and guyA. That made me even more uncomfortable as it made me paranoid about how else they’d be referring to me in their private conversations. Didn’t help that guyA laughed it off as “a bit of banter”. "
"I was in a technical meeting at work, all of us studying the same document to try to come up with a solution. I made a suggestion that a few people acknowledged. The man opposite made the exact same suggestion several minutes later. I don’t think he was trying to pass the idea off as his own, I think it just never occurred to him that I had anything useful to contribute so he wasn’t even listening to me. I casually mentioned that he’d made the same suggestion as me and he talked over me, clearly not registering what I was saying. I’m quite senior to him at work. He is new and apparently assumed I was a very junior member of staff. "

"A few months ago, somebody in the tea room at work (all male tea room) said some horrendous things about women. I called him up on it, a row erupted. we were taken to the office and both told off. I later asked my boss why he seemed to think that sexism and racism in the work-place is ok? I asked him quietly, away from anyone. He slammed the office door, squared up to me and told me that if I went higher with it, that I would be sacked. its easier for him to accept this behaviour than to challenge it, I threatened this, thus he got angry. I have experienced less extreme versions of this at work fairly regularly, if its institutionalised, its hard to fight. it takes all of us to make awareness training compulsory for all managers. "
"At work, I was reprimanded for a joke about whiskey. I was told it was extremely unprofessional to joke about drinking too much in a work environment. How ironic. I’m unprofessional for a whiskey joke, but my male boss can ask me to come to work with no pants on, to speculate to my male co-workers about what he thinks I’m like in bed and to touch me in VERY inappropriate ways, including trying to kiss me. He doesn’t even try to hide any of this behaviour. But SURE. I’m the “unprofessional” one. "
"So on a super rare occasion, a woman accused me of being sexist towards her… just for standing my ground. I was assertive and professional, yet apparently I wouldn’t have spoken this way to a man! Since when did being assertive and career driven become so offensive? As a woman who works her butt off, I refuse to accept that I should be treated this way – by men and women alike! It is hard being young in a world of older people who constantly disrespect you because they think you don’t know what you are doing. I have done nothing wrong and will continue to stand my ground and do my job! "
"Sat in a session, doing group work with three business men, one of whom senior. We are given a pen and must find a scribe. Mr senior picks up the pen, hands it to me and says “you must have neat handwriting”. “Because I’m a woman?” I say. He stammers, “No because you have good ideas”. So disappointed, esp given his senior title. "
"I am a 35 year old woman who has never wanted to have children but it is frequently assumed by people that I already have children (because I’ve been with my partner for 8 years it is assumed that we must want and have children). I am constantly expected to justify my reasons for not wanting or having babies and put up with people telling me that I will change my mind. One colleague even talked to me across our workplace (with members of the public there), asking my about what contraception I use and saying that I’d change my mind if I fell pregnant. I also have to put up with my mum telling people (friends and strangers alike) that she won’t have grandchildren because I don’t want children – she doesn’t understand that this is a personal choice and not for her to tell people. I then have to fend off the ‘you will change your mind’ comments from these people she has just told. I do have friends with young children who I adore – the next step is people (my mother especially) not being able to understand how I can love someone else’s child but not want my own. My partner, who is 16 years older than me, does not have children but never has these conversations with people and people don’t make these kinds of comments to him. It is always women who say these things to me. And they don’t think this is sexist. "
"This probably isn’t the best way to show my support, but the contact e-mail link didn’t seem to work. Everyday at work, in the pub and in advertising, I see sexism. However, many of the issues which you talk about are cultural issues which affect everybody. Images in advertising of men with chiselled, unnatural abs are just as damaging as the image of a woman in a bikini next to it. Its important to note that the sexist attitude can be an attitude directed towards guys too. I once had a night out with my ex and her friends, where they had a long conversation of how they need to ‘train’ their useless boyfriends. After a while of listening to it, I responded. ‘ you have just been calling your boyfriends, (who you are supposed to love and admire) useless, in need of training.. if I said anything resembling that about you, you would call me misogynistic and slap me”. they replied with silence before moving the conversation on. Women have been denigrated by men for centuries, but in aiming for equality, it seems essential to remember that we should treat everyone by their own merit, not by race, gender or age. My brother asked his fiancÃ© if she wants to take his name, keep hers, or him take hers. Feminism, to me is about choice. a woman should be able to choose to stay at work, or stay at home with family. likewise, a man should be able to chose to stay at home with the children I’m blabbing a bit, but my point is that the media portrays the ‘ ideal’ body for both genders and I have heard some women being judged for wanting the ‘ traditional’ household. if it is her choice, then great, if its not then something is wrong. It is insane how regularly women have to encounter horrible behaviour by men, a gender pay gap, horrible comments and all of the things which you mention, but it affects us all. we need to change as a society, progressing out of the Victorian mind-set, but we must do it together, with an awareness of gender differences, celebrating our differences, without limiting ourselves or others. You are amazing, and I sincerely thank you for breaking the taboo of talking about this! all the best, from Tom "
"I went out with some people from work on Friday night – a bunch of guys, and just one other girl. We were having a nice chat and somehow got on to the topic of equality and women’s rights; I was trying to explain to them just how much women have to go through on a daily basis, both in and out of work (all backed up by my female colleague), and they just flat out didn’t believe me. They didn’t seem to think it was possible that almost every woman has suffered some kind of assault, or any of the figures I told them about rape and assault in the UK alone. Just because they don’t do it, or don’t see it, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t happen! Even after I revealed to them some of things that I personally have experienced – sexism at work, groping on nights out, threats in the street if I’ve ignored catcalls, the list goes on…. – they seemed to think that I was the exception, that not all women could possibly have faced this. I told them to ask their girlfriends, but I doubt that they did. It was just so disheartening – I genuinely thought, after reading some of the positive messages from men on the Everyday Sexism Project, that men were so much more aware of these issues nowadays. Apparently I was wrong… This needs to change. There should be compulsory lessons on sexism and consent in schools across the country, maybe even across the world one day – how else are we really going to hammer home that these things still exist in our supposedly ‘equal’ society?

"I went to school for Police Foundations, and ultimately got a wonderful job as a Security Guard for four different hospitals. Our shifts were scattered between all the hospitals, a general hospital, a rehab hospital, and two mental health hospitals. It was not uncommon to have violent behaviours from mental health patients, and all security guards had the same training in handling physical altercations. At one point, there was a very aggressive male patient at the mental health hospital that required extra staffing to ensure everyone’s safety. During this incident (which lasted approximately a month), all female guards were removed from the hospital. Our shifts were revoked, and we were not allowed to work there due to us being “weak girls”. We were send to “safer” hospitals if there were shifts available, and if not we missed out on hours. Our boss, who was FEMALE made the decision. Our hours were significantly cut. Our dignity, training, and employment became ultimately useless. I cannot believe such a strong, stable, organization as a public hospital allowed women to be degraded and removed from doing the job we were hired to do. "
"We were being trained on how to use fire extinguishers at work. The fire systems technician placed a small pan of burning oil on the driveway, and we all had a turn at using a fire extinguisher to extinguish the flame.

"I am a freelancer in TV. I had a male boss who liked to use his power to humiliate women (and sometimes gay men or straight men he found threatening) in large meetings. He’d make jokes about their appearance or life / family / background and encourage other frightened workers and freelancers to laugh at them. He’d put people or their ideas down (and then use the ideas later, uncredited) He’d also find fault with their work in order to undermine their confidence and humiliate them. Once he and his male sycophants started discussing at what age a woman ceases to be sexually attractive to men. I had not been engaging in this conversation but he looked directly and pointedly at me and said a particular age. He knew I was that particular age at the time. On another occasion, he asked me to read out a piece of work he’d asked for and given a brief for. He let me read it and then proceeded to tell the whole room how this was exactly the type of work he didn’t want to see and was hyper-critical without actually saying what was wrong with it. Privately my colleagues told me they felt the work was good and met the brief and they couldn’t understand why he’d reacted like that to it but couldn’t say that or challenge him for fear of becoming a target themselves. When I tried to move to another area of the company he told me he would block me from moving there and that even if he couldn’t stop me he was going to be promoted and move over to that area and would then be my boss again. He was very threatening. As a freelancer I coulldnt go to Human Resources. And the union I belong to was sympathetic but has no strategy for cases of individual bullying other than to go in to workplaces to ‘educate’ staff/bosses generally about working without conflict. As a freelancer you’re particularly vulnerable. The only way out is to leave. I was not the only person he did this to and he was never challenged by his bosses. It was a creative environment and it suffered as people were too scared to create and risk being mocked or bullied. His cruelty became the creative vision and the end product suffered but mostly it broke people, their spirit and stifled talent. "
"I am an academic and about a year ago I met a PhD student for whom I should have been an external examiner. It was a students’ conference and I was attending the reception. He greeted me by telling me that I was much more beautiful than on my website picture. A colleague of mine, female, told him, in a nice way, that it was not really a way to speak to someone who will judge his academic work. He dismissed the comment as a joke. He then told me that my research had been so important for him it saved his life. When I smiled or laughed as I was uncomfortable he told me ‘not to belittle his feelings’. He also told me that he came to the conference just to see me. My colleague pointed out to him that I may not have come so he may not have seen me and come for nothing. He said that if I hadn’t come he would have found my home address and follow me there. I told him that it was not an appropriate thing to say. I left. I then called his supervisor to complain and say I would not be an external examiner for this person. The student then wrote to me to apologize saying that he now understands how to not to behave in professional situations. It’s a good thing but I should hope he knows that it’s not appropriate to behave like this in other situations as well. "
"I shared an office with two male colleagues, one gay the other straight. One day a young female colleague entered our office to speak to the straight colleague about a work related issue. When she left the office the gay man stated that he agreed with the straight colleague that indeed the female colleague does have a nice ass and expressed amusement at the fact that he’d never said that about a woman. The same straight colleague had taken occasion to discuss his sister’s boob job as well as use vulgar expressions such as going “tits up” in my presence. Both of these male colleagues are getting opportunity after opportunity placed in their laps and lots of support to advance their careers whereas I have to nearly beg my senior colleagues to think of me when an opportunity comes around. These two men are both 15 years my junior and have significantly less work experience than I do but they are valued much more and will reach tenure before I do because they are implicitly viewed as more worthy.

"When I first started work at the age of sixteen I worked at a car dealership where most other employees were male. I took my lunch breaks in the staff room, a dismal room with no windows, as I didn’t have a car back then and there was nowhere else to go in the local area. One lunch break I was eating my lunch when about 8 male mechanics all joined me in the staff room. As they came in they all gave me a strange look. One of them, the supervisor, turned on the tv and loaded a video into the machine. When the porn film started I was absolutely shocked and completely froze. I thought about leaving the room which would have meant pushing passed them and I was too embarrassed about the potential comments and teasing this would cause. I should have done it but I froze. I stayed in the room. After lunch my female colleague made a comment that it was disgusting – she knew about it but hadn’t warned me. The mechanics and their supervisor were all worried that I would tell on them but I never did. I felt guilty and dirty. Why did they go ahead with a sixteen year old girl in the room? They should have made sure I was ok and put me first. I know now that I should have taken action and that it wasn’t my fault. "

"I work for a tech company where I am the only female on the 8 person leadership team. My boss, the COO, frequently organizes social events – after work drinks, brunches on the weekend. I am frequently not included on invitations to these events. Sometimes I go to after work drinks, because I invite myself. Business is frequently discussed at these get togethers and sometimes this includes serious topics like concerns about funding. It’s not just social gatherings that I’m left out of either. I’m rarely included in meetings with the other 7. I feel like this affects my ability to my job because I am not as informed as the others. Recently I learned that my boss sent out an email to the other 7 male members of the leadership team inviting them to join him on a trip to Las Vegas. I was not included on the invite. When it came up in a conversation that one of them was going to Vegas, I inquired about his trip and eventually in the conversation learned that they are all going to Vegas. It was very awkward when this information came out and one of my colleagues said to me”Do you want to grow a penis and join?”. The tricky thing about handling this is that the person who is actively discriminating against me is my boss. "
"Fact-checking. I realized, sometime late into college, that a lot of men I knew whom I had thought to be super smart were just confidently saying whatever they were thinking without ever a second thought being given. People almost always believed them, no questions asked. Myself included. These things were often not even close to being true, as I would later learn when I stupidly repeated them and then was swiftly, and rightly, corrected. As a woman I have learned that I had better know what I’m talking about before I speak up on any topic, or I’ll lose when the fact-checking inevitably begins. Because I can’t always remember specific statistics or the exact order of events that prove what I am saying is true. Now, in the age of cell phones and actually having the ability in the palm of my hands to find these specific facts, who could question me, right? No. Without even so much as reaching for his own phone or uttering any real arguments to counter, he says to me, “Oh, and I suppose everything the internet says is true, huh?” I’m reading to him directly from Wikipedia.

"I asked for a pay rise from my boss, after having worked in the company for 4 years without getting one and I was aware that my (male) colleagues had had their salary raised. My boss’ attitude was belittling, he said that unfortunately in this economic climate it wasn’t feasible. Feeling frustrated I replied: “Well I can hardly settle all my monthly bills, I don’t quite know what to do.” To which he said: “A pretty girl like you can alway sell themselves on the street.” "
"My male colleague and law partner (I work in a law firm) was telling a story in a work meeting about a successful woman he met on a plane. He opened with â€œshe was a blonde bimbo, you know, the makeup, very attractiveâ€?. When some of us objected to the use of â€œbimboâ€? he told us to wait until we heard the whole story. Turns out the moral of the story (in his mind) was that in conversation during the plane flight he found out that the â€œbimboâ€? was running an extremely successful business. I can’t figure out what is more offensive â€“ use of â€œbimboâ€? per se to describe a woman he has never met and knows nothing about simply because sheâ€™s attractive OR being SO ridiculously surprised that an attractive woman can run a successful business? PS â€“ In discussion it also came out she was also a married Mormon mother of 5, which makes the â€œbimboâ€? label even more outrageous. "

"I am a senior planner in a construction firm with 12 years experience as a project/site manager on complex building projects. A newly appointed senior manager asked to meet me and during our discussion informed me that he was sure there were “lots of people in the company who could help me with the technical stuff”. He didn’t bother to find out anything about my background, just assumed I knew nothing. Then two days later in front of my peers in a meeting where he continually spoke over the top of me, he referred to me as “Just the girl who does the twiddly bits” Yesterday when I suggested I needed to attend an offsite meeting with our subcontractors he said that he “didn’t have a problem with it as it would get me out of the office”. I booked a meeting room this morning so I could meet with two of my project team and one of them said “good girl” to me for booking this meeting room, and not in an ironic way. "
"Hi Everyone, I wanted to share one of my stories of sexism that happened recently. I work as an ice sculptor and having started bright an early picking up dry ice at 7:30am I arrived at the studio to find that our rented freezer container was showing an error. I promptly called titan containers and got through to someone who explained that he would send me an email with some instructions. After receiving the email I realised that the instructions sent over were in actual fact for a completely different freezer unit and could not be used for the one we are renting. So again I called the company and explained this to the gentleman on the phone who informed me that he did not know the system very well so I would need to wait to speak to anyone guy when he got into work. I asked if he knew when the other guy would be at work and he proceeded to explain that it was raining in Essex and there was traffic on the motorway so he could not explain when we would get a call back. I responded that I understood that but as we have perishable items in the freezer we would need a rather urgent call back and asked if there was anyone else that I could speak to â€“ he responded â€œcalm down, girl Iâ€™ve already told you the other guy will call you when he gets inâ€?. After responding to the comment by asking him to call me by my name and less of the â€œgirlâ€? he proceeded to speak over me and not listen to what I was saying then practically hang up the phone whilst I was talking. My male colleague called this same man afterwards who then told my colleague how much he disliked me and proceeded to help my colleague with the problem in a very friendly manner â€“ quite unlike what I had to deal with! Everyday sexism is undermining and wrong, we are all equals and should be treated so. Working in a male dominated industry I find small bouts of sexism like this every day, not quite so bad as todayâ€™s experience luckily. Whether it is wolf whistles walking to work through the industrial estate, â€œencouragingâ€? comments from others when I (a woman) drive our forklift truck or use the chainsaw. This is something I deal with on a daily basis irrespective of my capabilities and experience, it is wrong. Thanks for listening, I hope one day these views will change in society â€“ in the meantime I will be continuing to fight discrimination even if it is in a small way each day changing one personâ€™s perspective at a time.

"I was working at the Political Party Conferences representing my organisation. These conferences take usually up five days and at the end of each working day you are free to attend various fringe events- discussions, experts panels and other professional gatherings. I was making the most of my time there, participate in various discussions and meeting new professional contacts. One day, one of a very senior manager in my organisation asked me how was my previous evening and if I met anyone interesting. I started telling him about various people I have been introduced to and then he interrupted me asking if any of these “new man has taken me shopping yet?” I was shocked and disgusted by his comment and the only answer I came up with at the spot was:”I beg your pardon?” "
"Was called ‘the filing bitch’ to my face this morning at work. Sent the below to my boss, asking to submit it as an open letter to all staff to explain what is so wrong about it. Still waiting on a reply hours later. No apology from the guy who did it, either. Open letter to staff. After the liberal use of the word “bitch” applied to various staff this morning, let’s avoid the word in future. It was offensive for a number of reasons. I don’t enjoy being called a bitch in play or with intent to harm. It is incredibly inappropriate in a professional workplace. I don’t like other people being called bitches, either, regardless of their gender. “Bitch” is a degrading, gendered pejorative. The only power that “bitch” has to demean, is by explicitly declaring the targets to be female, and therefore labelled inferior. I find this incredibly offensive as a woman, to be told by a man that my gender reduces me, and also reduces any men who are called bitches. The casual tone in which the insult was used is also disturbing, because it either reflects the user’s usually-unvoiced, real opinion of women, which just “slipped out” accidentally (this was the reason given for its use on me; no apology was made), or it was deliberately chosen to degrade the targets (—- and myself) by rendering us gendered and inferior. I am not sure which is worse. So I am requesting that we act like the professionals we are paid to be, and refrain from abusing one another with swearwords. There are plenty of other ways to have fun and banter in the workplace, which don’t involve perpetuating outdated, harmful notions of gendered superiority and inferiority. "
"About 35 years ago I got a job in the Marketing Dept. of Humana. I was an attractive woman in my 30’s, with a divorce in the works. This was my first real full time job after being a housewife and mother. I had two young teen daughters, and rent to pay, so I really needed this job. I was only there a few weeks, when my boss called me in his office during lunch. He told me he wanted me to hire a secretary. I asked him if he had any particular requirements and he said “just make sure she has big tits.” I was so shocked that I backed up and literally fell over his coffee table, while he laughed uproariously. Of course, I didn’t report him to HR because I knew they wouldn’t fire him, and my life …, if they didn’t let me go … would be unbearable. Thankfully, times have changed and even 15 or 20 years ago, I could have reported the incident and been believed. I surely wouldn’t tolerate it now and I’m grateful my daughters and granddaughters wouldn’t. That man made other crude remarks he thought were funny. Luckily, within a few months I was hired by their Ad Agency and left for a much better position that eventually led to a fulfilling career. Humana was now a client, although I never had to deal with him directly and I was put on other accounts shortly after. But I don’t think he was around much longer. His “type” was becoming a dying breed. "
"I’ve been for a few job interviews that went well until I gave the salary I was looking for, which the managers thought was far too high. I’m leaving my current job because I know I’m very underpaid compared to male colleagues. "
"I am Vice Chairman of a non-profit in the digital arena. I introduced a (male) contact to our organisation in order to assist with the growth of the digital business that he had recently joined at board level. He attended the event as my guest, and I ensured he was seated to his best business benefit. Four weeks later I received a query from our CEO regarding an event at the House of Commons, hosted by my contact’s business, to which the CEO of our non-profit had been invited but which the CEO could not attend. He was not familiar with the business in question, but it represented a good networking opportunity; would the Vice Chairman or Chairman like to go in the CEO’s stead? Our Chairman responded that he was not available. He had, however, received his own invitation to the event and believed that it would be of value for our non-profit to be represented. Strange to say, I have received no such invitation to the reception. Presumably Vice Chairman is regarded as insufficiently senior for such an occasion. "
"Dear Everyday Sexism Project, I am 35 and have had a shuddering wake-up call. As part of our recent teambuilding event I was asked to take part in an 8 person panel discussion, where a moderator asked each of us how we see our intuitionâ€™s future. I acknowledged that 4 of us on stage were not Directors, and although symbolic it was a sign of a real cultural shift which I felt was positive. Rather than pretend to have grand statements about our institution’s strategic vision, my wishes for the future were practical and honest offerings. The first was for us to stop hiding behind the aggregate number of women who work in our institution and acknowledge and address the fact that at the top there is a serious gender imbalance. My wake-up call has been caused by the responses of my colleagues. Peers who I know well and some I’ve never met have congratulated me for my concrete and meaningful remarks and commented on the stark contrast to the blah, blah non-statements from the senior and male Directors. Those same senior and male colleagues have made a joke about how playing the gender card is an easy way to score points (and spontaneous applause) and that my remarks were probably “a little bit too much”. My wake-up call is that those in power simply do not want the status quo to change – and that my voice apparently counts. "
"In my workplace women are put on tills and men are put in the kitchen, though they will be moved around occasionally depending on staffing. It doesn’t matter if you’re excellent at working in the kitchen, if you’re a woman your performance will be judged on how well you work on till. If you’re a man your performance can be judged on till or kitchen, however. No wonder two thirds of our managers are male. "
"At the pub after a conference dinner, my partner and I announce that we are going home. Strangely, everyone decides to hug us goodnight. A senior academic, a good 25 years older than me and who knows my partner (another PhD student), took this opportunity to lick my entire neck. I felt so ashamed that I didn’t say a word until we got home. "
"Where to start… ive only just found this fantastic and cathartic website. Being 26 i’m sure you can understand the endless encounters I could document on here. My latest was a ‘minor’ one compared to others but actually one that really got under my skin. I’m sat at work in a two hour meeting, I am the only female, surrounded by very senior male management. In the whole two hour meeting not one of my male colleagues looked me in the eye. Not once. Why? Yet happy to listen and take notice of each other. It made me feel extremely belittled and worthless. "
"In a work placement several years ago. I was 19, slim and eager to please. One guy, S, was being very nice to me. Solicitous, caring in a way he wasn’t to anybody else. Trying to crack jokes. Smiling awkwardly. I had no idea how to be with him. In the small firm we were in, especially in the tiny kitchen, it was easy for him to brush accidentally against me. One day, I was asked to take the letters to the post office. S. offered to drive me. He talked non-stop while driving, smiling in that awkward way of his, then while changing gears he put his hand on my knee. I froze. Told him this was wrong. Thankfully he stopped. He was 55 and the brother in law of the company’s owner. "
"I am a senior professional in the construction industry, Many meetings I attend or run, I am the only woman in the room. Recently I attended a difficult meeting where I was challenging the male project manager about a planned course of action, which was ill-advised. He was angry so kept inserting my name into his comments, so it sounded like he was constantly telling him off. I asked him to stop doing it! On another occasion, I was in a meeting with one male project manager and two other female professionals. We were all advising him on a course of action, he turned to a male colleague, and laughed, saying, ‘look how I am being nagged’ His colleague was clearly embarrassed, I was amazed and appalled. "

"I work in law and recently attended an internal training session. The presentation slides contained some irrelevant stock images, as the (male) speaker pointed out. All fine.

"I am a middle aged professional woman who works in London in global banking at executive level. In my daily life I frequently interact with COOs, CEOs, chief risk officers etc. You might expect that the men in these positions, having been successful enough in their education and careers to achieve these heights, might be more socially aware and alert to everyday sexism and unconscious bias. Sadly that is not my experience. I am nearly always interrupted more frequently than male colleagues (I discretely take tally marks in meetings), my views are not taken as seriously or given the same consideration – and this goes unchallenged. The sexism in the city (!) is just more subtle and insidious, and not of the wolf-whistling crude-comment variety, but just as entrenched. "
My boss calls me stupid. To my face. Everyday. Any and all mistakes I make are “stupid mistakes”. My co-worker who has been there 7 years had a break own last year due to his constant abuse. He is VERY respectful of other men. 
"1) I watch a lot of political dramas on Netflix and other tv stations/media and I’ve noticed that there are typically two types of female characters in these shows. There are those who are successful in business or politics and are strong and clever and good at what they do. These women are typically depicted by actors who conform to stereotypical beauty standards, they are physically attractive with good skin, shiny hair and a slim physique. They are also mostly young (younger than 40). Other female characters include those who are confined to traditional feminine roles i.e. Cleaners, nannies, housewives, or they are those women who are slightly older (50’s onwards) who are unmarried and are considered too “bossy” or “shrill” or “controlling” to be respected for their jobs. These women are depicted by less typically attractive female actors, those who don’t dress that fashionably, have grey hair or are above a size 12. Just something that I noticed. I think it’s a little ridiculous that only really beautiful, youthful women can be successful and anyone who is childless by the age of 40 is portrayed as some kind of villain as they’re too career-oriented or whatever. Terrible! 2) Also, in work, I’ve noticed that when someone is having a bad day and is bringing their issues into work with them, it’s generally okay if that person is a man or a boy. People usually say “we’d better just do what he says today, don’t want to upset him further”. If, heaven forbid, a woman is to come into work in a bad mood, she is often considered to be a bitch and people talk about her behind her back, calling her rude and inconsiderate and saying that she needs to smile and “lighten up”. I find it unfair that men are allowed to be moody for a day and people will step on egg shells around him but if a woman isn’t in a good mood then she’s shunned for it. Both of these things are examples of blatant sexism and reinforce damaging and confining gender roles. "
"A man has been brought in to ‘help’ me with my job because my boss, a man, ‘hasnt got time to look at it in detail and give feedback. My boss is currently standing outside chatting, after coming in late at about 11 and making toast and tea for himself. The man who has been brought in is not doing the job very well at all… He has already admitted that much of it ‘seems to be there already anyway’. And the particular areas that are supposed to be his speciality – the harder tasks, he has simply skimmed over and saying we will work on them together I guess… Now Im now having to re do it all myself. He will get the credit for helping me and saving the day. Another man who was sacked originally for doing the job so badly that the project was falling apart is going to have equal authorship on the entire project. Another two men in charge of the flagship part of the project have lifted completely large parts of my work (the same work Ive been told I need help with) and incorporated it without asking or crediting. I found this out an hour ago. All of them are paid more than me. Ive been doing this job for over fifteen years and have won multiple awards. I feel so very tired. "
"I am a product manager working in analytical chemistry aged 27 working with a team of older colleagues, mostly male. The male colleagues in my team treat me as a person and my workplace decisions with respect but I do not see this company wide. I had a conversation with a male sales colleague regarding an opportunity I was dealing with, I was not requesting advice on the matter or how to handle it I was simply discussing the opportunity and that it was exciting. I explained that our manufacturing site make you jump through hoops sometimes but I did have it all under control. The male colleague in a raised voice then said, you’re taking the wrong approach. You should have escalated this to your boss immediately (also male) so he can make it happen. I responded, I am making this happen, if I need to escalate to my boss I will when the time is right but for now.. I own this product and the opportunity is in hand. He persisted, insisting i was wrong I my approach and i should have escalated this. Another male colleague then began in the same approach demanding I was missing the point and yes I should have escalate already. Actually I had spoken with my colleagues (product managers) prior to this discussion with sales and we were all in agreement I had control of this situation. When I spoke to an older colleague aged 45 and male also a product manager he agreed that the sales men would not have spoken to him how they spoke to me if he was saying the exact same thing I was. For some reason that is beyond me, I am not taken seriously in the workplace, is it because I’m small, wear make up and don’t look serious enough? Is this seriously because I’m a small woman? I can’t stop thinking about it and I hate that I am not taken seriously because I don’t create the same presence as my male product manager colleagues…. "
"I worked in a small office in Central London, several years ago. There was this supervisor there who I always found a bit creepy, as he used to make inappropriate comments and sometimes stare at the women working in the office. One morning, I was working on one of his projects and we were both starting work at 8am which meant that we were in the office before anyone else arrived. When I arrived, he was already there, having opened up. He smiled at me and said ‘hello’ in a really suggestive way. I answered briefly, and made myself busy, switching on my computer and getting my papers ready. As I was doing so, he was still staring at me, with a grin on his face. I looked away and ignored him but I was aware that he was still staring. He then burst out laughing as he could tell that he was making me feel really uncomfortable. I have never forgotten that and I did feel very vulnerable as I was on my own with him in the office. He was deliberately making me feel uneasy so I still resent that deeply. "

"When I worked for a betting shop chain and had recently passed my manager’s exams, I caught the attention of our district manager who admittedly was a bit of a maverick but I found sound, said he thought I showed good potential and wanted to move me to work in a new shop they were opening for my first management position. Then he was moved away and a different district manager brought in. I asked about the placement I had been promised, and the new DM said it wasn’t protocol that a new manager would be given a new shop, and that they would instead move me to the new shop as a cashier. He waffled, and ran through the other staff members who would form the new team, and his reasons for choosing them: ‘ X was a safe pair of hands and very experienced manager, Y had been on relief management for years and had missed out on previous opportunities, Z was a very experience cashier with an impeccable record……and now that he had met me he could see that I would add value to the team, and would be something nice for the punters to look at!’ When it came to opening the new shop, it actually fell on me to organise the big opening day after all. The new district manager sent his brown nosing assistant who was hoping to be promoted to a district manager, to help authorise whatever I needed. When discussing staffing for the opening day, this guy told me to bring in ‘the hottest cashiers with the biggest jugs’. He gestured ‘big jugs’. "
"I was a classical musician and a few years ago I was given what was actually meant to be a compliment, as a colleague said; “You play like a man!” Happily my brain was working fast that day and I replied; “Which man’s that then? Because I don’t think I’ve met him!” The perpetrator then acknowledged that what he’d said had been unthinkingly sexist and then said; “You play very well!” For which I thanked him. "
"I got fired from a job because I filed a formal complaint against my boss to his senior, which was the correct protocol in the company. My boss had called me a ‘money grabbing whore’ in a one-to-one meeting that I had with him. This was wholly unacceptable. Apparently, I was only ‘there for the money’ and quite honestly, the job didn’t pay much anyway. At the formal complaint meeting with my boss’ boss, he took my boss’ side and said that I was too ‘outspoken and gobby’ in the workplace when I had just followed the example of my other colleagues, the majority of whom were men. Apparently being a confident, assertive woman means you’re instantly disliked. Despite what my boss had said about being a ‘money grabbing whore’, his boss closed ranks and didn’t see the problem with insinuating that a woman was a whore just because she wanted to work and earn money. "
"My manager said she will go out of her way to hire women over men. I didn’t see myself as being in a marginalized gender or in a “battle of the sexes” until this moment. Then, with 75% of my team as women, my manager, and my VP as women, I felt very marginalized because of the overt, vocalized gender-preference for women. This made me feel separate, devalued, and under-attack. I hope we can learn to treat people equally and with respect! Everyone has value, and we shouldn’t make preferences for people just because of their gender! "
"Sitting around, chatting about old days and someone says “Oh so and so slept with so and so other this one time”. Someone else expressed shock and surprise by saying “Really?!? I didn’t know so and so other slept with so and so!!”. Someone else then chimes in with “So and so other is a total slut though. . .” in a really disgusted tone of voice. Of course “so and so other” is a woman and “so and so” is a man. . . *rolls eyes* "
"I was queueing at the cafeteria in my workplace to pay for a bottle of water, and the manager in front of me was discussing the Formula One races with a male stockist behind the counter while the female barista made his coffee and took his order. As she went to pass him the chip and pin machine, it slipped out of her hand. “OH!”, the manager shouted. “This is because we’re talking about Formula One! Women HATE it when you talk about Formula One! Hair and makeup, hair and makeup!” The stock boy behind the counter laughed and said “Yeah! Hair and makeup, or bags and shoes, bags and shoes! That’s all they’re interested in!” Both men laughed. I was too shocked to actually say anything back, and I regret not calling them out on it to this day. "
"Last year I was at an evening event for work with a male coworker. Most of the people at the event were men, and another woman came up to me and gestured to my coworker “You must be his wife. My husband is right over there.” Some of the men I spoke with later also assumed I was married to my coworker, as if the only reason I would be attending an event is on a man’s arm. It is so insulting when people assume you are a +1 and nothing more, just because of your gender/age/appearance. My job is very important to me, but I am continually discouraged by the misogyny I encounter in the workplace, especially from older men. "
"While working as an organiser at a B2B event in the city, I was walking through the exhibition halls and about four men from one of the company stands blocked my way. They stood in a circle around me, trying to get me to talk with them and then tried to grab me to dance with them (they seemed to be drunk). I managed to fake smile and move away so as not to cause a scene, but I was shaken. Slightly later on as I had to walk past them again, one of them said “She’s pretty fit, I’d hit that” loudly, so pretty much everyone in the vicinity could hear. "
Job hunting: My Job Coach tells me I should ‘flirt more’ when I go to interviews. Can I just check that we are still living in 2016 and and not 1950? 
"– Once in Lidl, totally engrossed in which cereal I wanted, I had glanced at two guys who looked like they were judging a transvestite who was shopping there too, then they caught me looking at them so decided to walk up to me and stroked my head (shaved on one side) then as walking away kept saying disgusting comments about fucking etc. I was totally speechless because it took me totally by surprise. I was so angry yet couldn’t say anything to them. It left me feeling vulnerable for the rest of the day and I am someone who considers themselves strong and hard to victimise like this. I felt so annoyed that they objectified me and had no respect whatsoever, I felt robbed of my right to be an individual. I distinguish myself as an individual, a person and not a woman or a girl or an object! – Once at work, a loud and brash customer asked how much the sausage rolls were, and after telling the price he asked how much I was, if he could buy me and what time I finished. He wasn’t being aggressive, he thought it would be a funny little joke. But I told him it was inappropriate, especially after I had been so welcoming to him and his friend. I felt extremely disappointed that even if just a joke I was being made as the object, a thing he could buy for his own pleasure. – At work again, there is the general manager and two assistant managers – one of which was me. I found a lot during this job (which I have now left), that my opinion was ignored or not valued. A lot. The other two managers were males, and one of them didn’t make me feel like my opinions were not valued but he did make comments about my appearance which were crude and inappropriate. The general manager however would not take onboard much about my ideas about our staff or the bar itself and what we could do to improve it. He told me off once for ordering some stock he had already ordered (a packet of plastic forks), despite the fact that I had ordered loads of things he had forgotten to order or didn’t think to order and I was trying to ask him to make sure he kept a list of things ordered or still to be ordered so we were all in the know and could order whatever or expect the order to arrive. He also didn’t listen to me when I told him one of our staff shouldn’t be working with us because he was always turning up late or not at all and not really behaving like one of the team, but as soon as an older and male staff member had told the GM the exact same thing, then it was taken onboard. I was so happy and proud to be in a managerial position at this bar but by the end I felt there was no encouragement or eagerness to see me develop myself and my responsibilities there, whereas the other male AM got much praise etc for his contribution and ideas.

I have been working at a store for 1 year and found out 6 months ago that a colleague is interested in me. After repeatedley telling him I already had a boyfriend he continued to messege me. He has often said and texted rude messeges against my character but then apologises and expresses his love. He has recently started sending me messesges through another collegue after blocking his number. I have seen messeges between my collegue and him tarnishing my character and making assumptions about what I do on my free time. This is all a result of ignoring him at work. I don’t want to draw attention to meyself at work and don’t know how to bring this up with a manager. 
"I’m a 55 year old woman. I have worked in the male dominated world of printing my whole adult life. I have endured a lot of sexism through the years (and some really cool dudes too). I’ll just say that my current favorite is the surly fellow who always tells me to “smile”. Really? First give me something to smile about like a sexist free workplace. Being the only woman at my workplace I cannot tell you how many times work has “fallen” to me, cleaning, filing. You have to have tough “love” and just tell them NO, I only clean up after myself. "
"Listening to the audiobook, workplace section. Reminded me of a job interview I had once for a equipment rep. Man asks me if I have children. As I do, he tells me this job isn’t for me and that I should be there for my son. That there is a lot of ‘banter’ with the ‘lads’ and I may not be able to deal with that. I try and argue my points but he’s already decided the woman should stay at home. Continues to patronise me for the rest of the interview. The worst part is I didn’t see how awful this was until months later. "
"I have a very senior role in a research institute. My work is highly regarded and my professional advice is frequently sought by other organisations. The (male) director of the institute routinely ignores my advice, preferring instead the suggestions of my (male) line manager, who is not an expert in the field. This is an organisation that claims to be actively engaged in increasing the number of women at senior levels. It’s a joke and a sham – we are barely visible and hardly ever listened to. "
"In 2007 I was a workplace rep for a large UK trade union. I was the only female rep on a team of 7. While on union duty together at the workplace, one of my male colleagues, out of nowhere, suddenly started staring at my groin while putting out the tip of his tongue and simulating cunnilingus. I was shocked, embarrassed and upset. At the time this happened I was 62 years old. The union claimed to protect its members from discrimination and harassment, and to fight for equality, so I expected that when I reported this incident to them they would deal with it appropriately. They did not. The man of course denied it and they believed him. They suggested I had imagined it. They told me that they didn’t want to risk him losing his job. They fobbed me off and continuously made excuses for not dealing with my complaint. A senior officer told a story about not being able to return my calls because heâ€™d lost his phone charger. The General Secretary didn’t reply to my letters because he said that his secretary had lost them. They accused me of bringing the union into disrepute by making the complaint. They laughed at me behind my back, called me â€œthe mad womanâ€? and said that at my age I should have been grateful. One senior officer even asked me what Iâ€™d been wearing when the incident happened (jeans and t-shirt, as if it mattered). I got over the original incident easily enough, but what I couldn’t get over was the way my trade union treated me. Eventually, I took the union to an employment tribunal claiming sex discrimination. I didn’t win, I was representing myself while the union employed an expert barrister, even so, I donâ€™t regret my action, which I took for the sake of my self respect. I still have the t-shirt they gave me to wear which has the unionâ€™s logo across the front. I know this sounds petty but I use it to clean my shoes. Everyday sexism is alive and well in the trade union movement. "
"One of the men that reports to me had taken a few unplanned days off for childcare. My boss, who is male, asked me to have a word with my direct report and suggest that his wife take care of the children. It took me a while to confront my boss about this, but when we finally had a conversation about his inappropriate reaction is when people take time off,I drew his attention to the fact that nobody else in our group has a stay-at-home spouse besides himself. I subsequently told his boss about it, she said she was required by HR to have a conversation with him about it. I certainly hope he gets the message. In the future I’ll be much quicker about confronting him and reporting him when necessary. "
"I work in a male dominated environment. Boss’ son who is married makes continuous sexual innuendo at my expense which makes me feel not really part of the group. Asks to see my breasts on nights out. Apologises for it in the morning. But as soon as around other male colleagues, starts again. “Banter” apparently. The new word for making sexism OK. I don’t even think sexism is misogyny related or about women anymore. It’s how insecure our society has become. That people are continuously jockeying for position and trying to show status – and demeaning women is one way of doing this in front of other men. How pathetic. I’ve told him how immature I think he is but I can’t go too far as he has his dad’s (our boss’ unconditional support). His wife comes into the office often, I’m sure she wouldn’t like to find out. "
"I live in privilege but come from a very urban, and often dangerous, environment. I know my rights and I know how to spot danger. I know how to read body language and how to deal with threatening people. I have no physical challenges that prevent me from running, screaming, or generally making a very public fuss. I have a black belt and I know my rights. While I am a woman, all this keeps me pretty safe. As a result of all these privileges, knowledge, and skills, on a frequent basis I find myself subtlety protecting the people around me. When a man lewdly stares at me, I stare back straight faced and unashamed. This makes them either feel uncomfortable (success!) or I escalate. When I see a man do the same to another woman, I get the man’s eye contact with subtle body language and again do the same. When I see a woman walking in front of me and a man looks like they are going to unwantedly approach her, I assess the environment we are in and either partial hide myself from view so I could call the cops if needed, or I speed up my walk so that I could stand up for her if she needs. Often, my sheer presence walking near her stops the man. When someone cat calls me or another woman, I will sometimes heckle them but will always confront them with my body language so they know this has been noticed and is not ok. Again, this usually makes the man ashamed or I escalate. There are two sad things to this story. The first is obvious: why do I need to do this? This shouldn’t be necessary and I shouldn’t need to do it on a near daily basis. The second is more related to your project: how do I do this? When I reflected on my lived experience, thanks to your project, I realized how much of my day is the complex and subtle control of body language. Almost never do I say actually anything. To do put words to these incidents and verbally call someone out on what they are doing would categorize me as ‘hysterical’ or ‘overreacting’ and thereby put myself into possible danger (as well as defeating the purpose). Why must I have to be so cautious? Why can’t I just say something? This also shouldn’t be necessary and I shouldn’t need to do it on a near daily basis. My body is not public property and when someone is rude, inappropriate, or threatening, I should be able to say something. Instead, I must stick with this complex dance or gestures: eye contact, control of facial expressions, hold of my shoulders, straitening of the back, lowering of my center of gravity, assessing the distance of witnesses, blocking views, obstructing pathways, touching my purse (to indicate remind about a cellphone), and finally, sometimes, determining if traffic is slow enough that running into the middle of the street would cause cars to stop and thereby be captive witnesses (who likely also have phones). All this in less than a second. All this on a nearly daily basis. All this for not only my safety but that of those around me as well. And to top it off, it is so normal for me that I hardly notice I am doing it. "
"I am from developing third World country with hard sexism in it. If I am not marry till 23 here people will be sorry at you.

"I worked for a horrible design agency in London, the sales men refereed to me as a lesbian as I didn’t have a boyfriend at the time, the other men talked about women who were gay indulging in sexual practices and they had all read my CV that I had given in to the Director so they all knew my business. One guy asked me for a kiss after he gave me a lift to a client meeting and another said he liked watching me leave ( so he could look at my bottom ) at the time I was new to the industry and young and naive and had a high rent so it took me ages to leave and i found it a horrible experience, looking back I wished I had had the courage to leave earlier, but really this sort of thing should not go on in the workplace, but this happens when there is no hr department and it is a small owner managed company.

"At my work (a small shop) older men constantly tell my female colleagues and I to smile, or to cheer up, despite the fact we are all rather happy and welcoming people.

Couldn’t log into my work laptop. On my way down to the IT department my two male colleagues suggested that I forgot my password and told me to try my pet and husband’s names.

Two weeks ago I had a medical problem, I had a huge swelling in my chin (it turned out to be an enlarged lymph node in response to some kind of virus). I had many symptoms, including pain and tiredness, it was also a huge aching swelling that was effecting the left side of my face. This happened at the weekend so I called the non-emergency nhs number. The operator was a man, he asked me where I was and I said I was at my boyfriend’s flat and that I didn’t know the address (I didn’t have my laptop near me to quickly google the post code), I was not expecting these questions and he made me feel like I was stupid. He asked me how old I was instead of my birth date which I know from previous experience that this is not a standard question. He implied I was not very intelligent, and I really do think it was because a young woman. He assumed I was an idiotic female stereotype, he talked down to me and at one point when he asked me the date and I got it wrong (I was on my summer holidays from uni and had been travelling and not really keeping track of the dates) he said ‘oh so you are normally muddled’, I strongly replied that I wasn’t ‘normally muddled’ and explained the logical reasons I had not known the date. I am a student at a good university and have always excelled academically and could have chosen any degree/career path. Yet, all those years were somehow called into question when this man made me feel stupid and like a ‘silly girl’. I even asked to speak to someone else but he said ‘there is no one else here’ which I also don’t think is a standard reply. At the end he tried to apologise in a kind of way by saying ‘I am sorry if you perceived my comments in that way’ (as rude), I replied that it wasn’t my perception it was how they were meant. I felt belittled and upset by someone who was supposed to be helping me. I was in such a vulnerable state, he had no idea what was wrong with me, it could have been anything, even cancer, but in his mind he had decided there was nothing really wrong with me and that he would belittle me for it. I cannot prove that this was a sexist discrimination but I just felt like the kind of comments would not ever be said to a man had they been calling. "
"If sexism is over then why can’t my colleague also refer to men as love, sweetheart, etc, both in person and over the phone??? They’re missing out and it’s not fair ðŸ™? "
"When a customer at work was done paying for his order and I was done bagging it he said “Thank you” to the male cashier and “Thank you, darling,” to me. "
"I worked for a Pizza chain several years ago. The CEO – Phill, came into our store one day, I saw him noticing me from the other end of the room, he looked like he was up to something. He came in and started shaking hands with all the male staff saying Happy New Year to each of them in turn. When he finally got to me, he said the same words but expected a kiss. I refused but he kept repeatedly asking, when I kept refusing he was extremely angry. Why should I be singled out for different treatment just because I am female? I will kiss whoever I want to kiss and not be forced to kiss some creepy fat man just because he is the boss. I did not last long in that job long after the incident. "

"In my first few days of a new job, a security guard for the building my workplace is in (NOT a colleaue of mine, but he feels he has the right to walk in and out of my work like he owns the place) and i dip dye my hair pinkish red. As soon as the security guard see’s it he says “you know whats coming now, Period Head!!” This is a nickname he used for a colleague of mine before i started working there, neither her or him mentioned it (i know an older employe who told me of this name calling) my colleague cried as it upset her so much, yet this security guard feels the right to call me such a horrific sexist offensive name. i barely know this guy and he is mocking me for my choice in hair colour? i got it reported and he had to appologise to me, i wont speak to him again as he makes my skin crawl with uncomfortableness. only one of my colleagues talks to this security guard, i now know why. "
"When I was in college, I worked at a cafe owned by a couple – the husband was in his 60’s and the wife was in her 40’s. When I would go upstairs to hang my coat up and get an apron, he would rub his body up against me in the narrow hallway and try to hug me and kiss me, as if in a friendly greeting, but it did not feel friendly at all. I was young and naive and didn’t know how to firmly make him stop. He would slip me $20 bills or bus passes from time to time and I took them, not knowing how to politely refuse. I felt so guilty that by accepting these small tokens, I was giving him permission. But now in my 40’s I understand that it was not my fault. I did not bring it on. I finally quit the job because he tried to insist that I come to his apartment one night when his wife would be out of town. I realized that he did not care what I wanted. He only wanted what he wanted. "
"I wrote to the BBC to complain about rumours that the flagship breakfast show, ‘Today’ was considering an all-male, all-white line for the General Election broadcast earlier this year. The show has two very experienced and talented female presenters but the male presenters, according to reports, had thrown their toys out of the pram and demanded to be on air. Sure enough the presenters were Nick Robinson and John Humphreys. I don’t think there was much public interest in this story so perhaps that is why the BBC completely disregarded the interests of half of their listenership. But nobody even responded to my request for gender parity. "
"I have had a number of my elderly female patients ask me if I was gay ( I am not and am perfectly fine with any one who is gay, transgendered or of other gender identity).The first couple of times I just kind of shrugged it off, but after 5-6 inquiries began to wonder what might give them that impression. The best I could tell was that by not demonstrating behaviors that they had come to believe as common, but inappropriate behaviors of men through out their lives perhaps I simply wasn’t interested in women. Now of course as an Occupational Therapist there are many ethical and legal reasons, but I would be genuinely horrified by any professional that involved themselves with a patient. But that wasn’t really the point. They were making an observation based upon decades of experience with men in various settings, educational and professional levels, military service or any other variable. In a way I felt relieved that they didn’t identify me as a man who treated women as little more than sex objects if they bothered to consider them at all. But I also have felt a little sick and sad about it ever since. Progress has been made, but not nearly enough. "
"I was at work, putting clothes on and rail and a man came behind me and slapped me on the butt. I wanted to shout at him but at that my moment I felt like I had loss my voice. When I look back at the situation, I wish I had said something, this happened a couple of month ago when I was 18. "
"In an attempt to reduce the harassment every shift can bring at my grocery store job, I’ve recently changed my hairstyle from braids to a roll in a jaw clip and started wearing dark makeup to try to look less naive and innocent – especially since I already look young for my age – and more mature, professional, and hopefully a little intimidating. And it’s worked, for the most part. I haven’t been teased or harassed by a man in a month (though I have gotten a few unsolicited comments from other women, including one incident of being hassled about smiling; I don’t know how to make women stop too). I’m glad it’s been reduced, but it’s gotten me thinking how sad it is that I had to do this at all – how complete strangers decide whether or not to treat women with respect based SOLELY on their appearance. I had to buy a big jaw clip, learn to roll my hair, buy makeup, spend hours on YouTube learning to apply makeup and then practicing, JUST to not be harassed on the job. JUST to not be hit on by men my dad’s age. JUST so other people pass by me without making comments or making fun of me. I also bought a 130db personal alarm and I wear it conspicuously on my apron – INSIDE the store, even though I’m surrounded by cameras, people and lights. I wore braids for years only because my hair’s so thick I honestly didn’t know I could do anything else with it. Only recently did I realize that “little girl” style was drawing unwanted attention (I’m now 23). And I probably would never have bothered to get into makeup at all (besides concealor and nail polish) if customers controlled their mouths. But now I can’t go to work without it, even for a short shift, because the risk of harassment is so high. "
"At an annual book arts fair at my workplace, I met one of the artists/ vendors I’d been in contact with over social media in preparation for the event, we had crossed paths briefly the previous year but were never officially introduced (I coordinate art education and media for a gallery). I introduced myself to him in front of my (female) boss. His response was: “Ah yes, Brigitte, who could forget a pair of legs like that?” I was wearing a skirt. I instantly felt cut down to size and was so stunned I didn’t know what to say. My boss looked uncomfortable, but I could tell by the look on her face she was hoping I wouldn’t say anything “rude” back. "
"My boss has always been quite nice to me, i just thought it was because i was a hard worker and did my job well with a lot of heart and passion, then one day he called me into his office and asked me what i was doing that night, i said i was just going to go home and that i didn’t have any plans and that my partner was going out with friends that night. He asked if he could come and visit me. I said no. He was playing with a little lock in his hands at the time and he said what if i put this “down there” pointing to my genitals and i was the only one who had the key and i would open it whenever i liked. I started to walk out and he told me to sit back down, so i did. He asked me when he can massage me i said never. He said that he was going to make a level of our workplace his secret life and that i would stay there and he would come and visit me. He said with a grin that if i leave work he knows everyone in this town and he would make life very difficult for me. I left the room and went in the elevator, he followed me and when we were in the lift he got really close to me like he was going to kiss me and i moved away then he moved my top so he could see my bra and i said stop, then he smiled and looked me up and down and said we’re going to have to make some changes to you. I said i don’t need to change anything. I still work there, and i don’t know what to do i am friends with his wife and his two kids are so lovely. I don’t want to say anything because i don’t want to cause any trouble, and in this situation everyone will probably blame me. I want to just move away somewhere but my friends and family are here, why should i have to run scared from this disgusting monster. "
I was once told I could not work a night job as a hotel desk clerk because I was female and would be in danger. My bf at the time was told he would be more likely to get it because he’s male. 
"i’m from Hungary but I spent last summer in England, working. at my workplace I met a hungarian man, so every time we time during work we spoke about things and sometimes we went to lunch break together. I was in a foreign country and it was nice to talk to someone who shares my mother tongue. but after a while it got really disturbing he wanted te be with me all the time, he wanted to take me home but I didn’t wanted him to know where i live. after a week he asked me on a date. I was 18 and he was 35. i paniced and i basically shouted ‘no’ at him after that i tried to avoid him, but every time i was him in the locker room he looked so angry at me. i was really afraid that he might follow me home one day so i always had to look behing my back. the next day i found a flower bucket hanged on my locker with a love note in it. it said that he loves me and i light up his day and i broke his heart. we met like 1,5 week before that. i was really scared but i was too ashamed to tell anyone se as soon as i could i bought a plain ticket and went home to hungary.

"I worked for a horrible design agency in London, the sales men refereed to me as a lesbian as I didn’t have a boyfriend at the time, the other men talked about women who were gay indulging in sexual practices and they had all read my CV that I had given in to the Director so they all knew my business. One guy asked me for a kiss after he gave me a lift to a client meeting and another said he liked watching me leave ( so he could look at my bottom ) at the time I was new to the industry and young and naive and had a high rent so it took me ages to leave and i found it a horrible experience, looking back I wished I had had the courage to leave earlier, but really this sort of thing should not go on in the workplace, but this happens when there is no hr department and it is a small owner managed company.

"Iâ€™m currently working in a Wellbeing charity for a few months now and initially things were great in the organisation. However, after my female manager went on annual leave the CEO of the charity started to touch me inappropriately (such as stroking and rubbing my lower back, hands on my shoulders, squeezing) bullying and intimidation and invasion of my personal space as well. I later found out that his â€˜touchingâ€™ was an â€˜openâ€™ secret in the organisation and he did it to many women. I felt disgusted that this CEO in his very late 50s, a married man was doing this to young women and vulnerable volunteers in this wellbeing charity. It was unwanted touching and I voiced my disgust and said â€˜Noâ€™ and physically flinched from his unwanted gestures. I was quite shocked and did not report it initially as I thought it would stop once my manager was back. It did not unfortunately. Iâ€™ve had to take out a grievance as a last resort and although it is stressful and has caused me much stress and anxiety I strongly feel it was and is the right thing to do. Do not let anyone in a position of power do this to you, itâ€™s unacceptable and illegal (please research Laws in your country and seek advice from employment help lines, I have found ACAS in the UK very supportive). I do not know the outcome of this grievance as the Board of Trustees Chair has yet to make a decision, I suspect much like the Jimmy Savile incidents in the UK they will be keen to sweep it under the rug. However, whatever happens I know I took a stand and said â€˜NOâ€™ and I hope and trust other people will also begin to say â€˜NOâ€™ to sexual harassment in the workplace. "
"I used to work in retail, one day it was my break, I left my counter then leaned over to pick up something I’d forgotten when someone slapped my bottom. I turned around and it was my boss. I told him that was workplace harassment and he replied: ‘yea but you enjoyed it.’ I had to walk away. "

"I’m in a male-dominated profession. A visitor joked that I must be the secretary of the person who shared my office. Another visitor assumed I was my colleague’s girlfriend, when I was his supervisor. On two separate occasions, colleagues told me they’d thought I was from human resources, for no apparent reason as I’m in the same profession as them, except that I’m a woman. Upon meeting me for the first time in our mutual workplace, a colleague said I “must be from “. Such incidents suggest that a bunch of people are determined to view me as some kind of Other. "
"Am in the office, as head of a project in software development. It’s a meeting with the customer who wants things changed around, in a big way, but obviously is not prepared for the project to then either take longer or cost more. So I present some facts and figures, say something like, so, it’s fine, we can incorporate your changes – however you have to be aware that the scope changes and – I get up and stand next to the whiteboard, roughly sketch the new timeline next to the old one and jot some figures next to it – we’ll probably end up here with the development…blahblah, are you willing to agree to this in written form, and sign for it, because we need to make sure this is getting paid in the end… So the customer rep (who’s about my height aka short, bespectacled, balding and making up for it by dickheadedness in general anyway) gets up, puts his friggin hand on my shoulder and says in a manly man’s voice: ” oh dear, we have to stop being afraid, trust me, it will all be covered”. WTF. I was telling him he has to friggin pay for our work. I wasn’t afraid in the slightest. The worst bit is I was so mad at his move and I could so see what he was doing there – and I couldn’t say a word in response. Im still mad. at myself. How can that be. "
"I was waiting tables on what my workplace calls biker night, serving a regular of mine who is the president of a biker crew. He was with a member that I didn’t recognize. He immediately looked me up and down and told me “what a cute little thing” I was and asked for a beer. I brought him one and he grabbed and hugged me, thanking me for the beer. I quickly scuttled off, uncomfortable with the unexpected contact with this large older man. I continued serving him and my regular. I was turned at one point speaking with my regular when the new friend came from behind me, squeezed my ass and walked off to continue speaking with his biker mates. I felt shame immediately as well as the pressure to remain silent on the matter. I decided to bring him his check immediately. he took it from me, asked why I was so glum, and laughed. I never told anyone because I felt an obligation to keep these guests happy despite the ill treatment. I told a male coworker friend and he laughed and said, “I wish someone would grab my ass.” I’m only 18. I work at a “family restaurant”. "
I hate the way a lot of men love to ‘teach’ women things the second you make even a minor mistake or ask a simple question. I don’t know how many times I’ve been patronised or been given a condescending answer just for trying to get better at a job or do something the right way. 
"Last week a two of the women I work with were talking about something that I found a bit inappropriate and embarrassing to be stuck listening to (my desk is between theirs), when out of nowhere one of them asked me a very personal question. I told her I was not willing to answer and did not want to be involved in this conversation. Later she pulled me to one side. I thought she was going to apologise, but instead she asked the same question again, I told her I didn’t want to talk to her about my personal life with her and that even if she thinks this is just a harmless joke, I did not see it that way. She seemed to snap at me later in the day when I made a mistake, when she would normally be quite patient about those sort of things. Now I am stressing because I am on rota with her this Saturday, so it will just be the two of us in the office together all day. I spoke to my boss about what happened and asked if I could switch with someone so this had a chance to blow over, but he was no better. He just told me to grow a pair and stop bothering him with my crap. I am thinking of calling in sick now. Even if it means I don’t get paid. "
"I have just returned home from the Roehampton Asda Store – I was there at approx 2.30pm on sat 1 October. While I was in the checkout queue (No 7), in the next checkout queue was male customer who was loudly hurling sexist abuse at his partner, shouting at her that ‘women can’t catch… you can’t drive… can’t play sports….’ and which ended in him telling her ‘you’re all f*cking c*nts’. At this point, I turned round and said I was not prepared to listen to that sort of language, or have it in front of my daughter – it would be illegal between colleagues in any workplace and neither customers nor staff in a shop should have to listen to it. While I would have expected his response – to continue with the language but to hurl it at me – it was the attitude of the checkout assistant that I found shocking – she (a middle aged woman) responded ‘it’s just banter’. When I asked her if she would find racist abuse acceptable her response was ‘some people like to have a laugh’. Calling a woman a f*cking c*unt is not ‘having a laugh’. it is not in any way acceptable. I understand that staff are probably discouraged from getting involved in customer altercations, but this was beyond behaviour that should be considered acceptable in any public area. I spoke to the customer services manager immediately afterwards but I did not feel he was taking the complaint seriously either (he did not seem to care which checkout it had happened at, for example). The sexist abuse alone was reason to complain – the language around it was totally unacceptable. Asda staff need to be trained to be able to ask abusive customers to stop, and to call security when they do not. As I said to the assistant at the time, I doubt racist abuse at the checkout would have gone unchallenged, so why does sexism not? "
"Men across the board, from the workplace to the doctor’s office to pretty much any situation, stare at my chest or body while I speak to them. I understand that it’s human nature to check out other people, but it makes me so uncomfortable and small when say, a coworker or my doctor chooses to take extended pleasure from my body by staring or glancing up and down when they finish talking and I begin. It happens even when I wear a loose t-shirt, pants, or sweater, and I don’t have large breasts. It’s disrespectful, disconcerting, and makes me feel like a piece of meat instead of a person whose opinions and comments deserve full attention and consideration. My opinion of these men immediately changes when they do this, and when they explain that cannot help but stare, I wonder why they would want to insult themselves and their self-control like that. "
"i work in a bar at a hotel, we have boxing events each year which i hate doing but i can’t avoid them because they are always so busy. One time working one, i was told to get back onto the bar and stop cleaning the room – which was understandable it was quite busy – but then i was told to make sure I smile, be chatty with the customers and look presentable so that the guys will stay at the bar and buy more drinks.. I felt pretty annoyed and grossed out how my boss pretty much was using my face/body to get more customers in buying drinks… "
"The everyday sexual assault of childhood by the spouse of a parent became apparent for what it was on transition to adulthood. To my slowly emerging dismay, the confusing violation & limitation of potential & development, was not an unusual psychological experience but one which was then to be found commonplace in the encounters of everyday female adulthood. The same socially threatening attitudes and behaviours that I came to articulate from reflecting on a traumatic puberty, turned up in each adult relationship here combined with violence, exploitation & lies with verbal abuse, on the street from strangers, in the GPs, in the family courts & social agencies, in the workplace, & ultimately as life lay in tatters in isolation, on the internet. I’ve been protesting all of my life. I’ve never stopped complaining. I could write as many stories of struggle & triumph in adversity, yet after watching your talk and other advocates about speaking out, I am reminded of the sense of silencing oneself more as time goes on. And humble achievements are gracefully cherished when being born a girl in a minority group ensures a place of not being listened to or respected across society. "
"I was at a safeguarding conference and the all-female team of experts used images of women dressed to be sexually provocative during discussion of early & inappropriate sexualisation of young people. I found this part of the presentation to be unnecessary, trivialising and it seemed to have been included for sensationalisation, I would even say gratification reasons the way the pictures were commentated upon flippantly. Mostly female colleagues reacted with indifference and didn’t get why I was singularly unimpressed. Male colleagues said they enjoyed the pictures and that it woke them up from otherwise completely switching off from the seminar. We all work with some of the most vulnerable children and this was one example of appalling irresponsible attitudes including from the expert speakers, to an important theme in training. It followed that I often do not agree with adults’ irresponsible attitudes about females setting poor examples to teen boys at work. And being spoken over as a woman during team meetings by men has become tiresome. I guess that makes me a closet feminist because it’s been made a dirty word. "
"At work some guys persistently contradict me in meetings, yet with each other they mutually support each other’s contributions, whatever they are. This badly affects my confidence to speak my contributions. Sometimes I can’t get a word in. Then it makes me feel angry and frustrated because its a culture that’s so ingrained and challenging it is wearing. It’s not a high-flying role, but we work in teams and the teamwork is vital for our personal safety at work. When a male colleague highlights something positive I’ve done as an equal, I sense it strengthens my profile at work, but then it has caused jealousy and resentment from other colleague groups. Work would be so much more productive if being our best was positively reinforced. I don’t experience feeling equal as a single adult woman at all. "
"At work I was fairly new. A much older man who had worked there for years and was the husband of a more senior member of staff, he took the liberty and put his hands around my waist which was upsetting and violating; he made a comment which I’ve blocked out. Another time an older co-worker I made ordinary small talk with in the course of the day, including about the summer weather then made a comment about imagining me in swimwear, which made me feel uncomfortable and annoyed. I had been talking normally as an equal, then I felt objectified, disrespected and a bit threatened. I made a formal complaint about the first incident which felt empowering at first as though it was being handled sensitively, but then it felt like box-ticking because it resulted in no discipline and he was regarded as a good ole boy. I didn’t report the second incident. I responded by avoiding that co-worker as well and questioning or guarding my interactions more. It all had a silencing effect and made my upbeat personality at work more wary. It made work feel like a threatening space psychologically. "
"I was criminally harassed by a man twice my age a few months ago. He managed to find me on facebook and soon after sent me hundreds of threatening messages. He contacted my workplace, my family and my friends. He told me he was going to “find” me, and that when he did he would “violate and ravage” me. I called the police in November, as far as I know he’s yet to encounter any consequences apart from a restraining order. "

"I live in a resort town, which is very hard to do. There aren’t many great jobs that pay well and currently, the county I live in is going through a housing crisis. I was talking with a friend who I had worked with for a few months at a restaurant. I have worked in the Food and Beverage Industry for many years. However, when I finally landed a job in the resort town at a restaurant, I was stuck hosting and was told I would never bartend regardless of my years of experience, even as a General Manager at a bar. I was talking about how the F&B industry has done nothing for me. My friend, who is a man, said that’s the way it is, everyone must start at the bottom. However, since I was a girl, I had to host while his entry position was bussing tables. Bussing tables actually comes with a pretty nice tip-out. It struck me in that moment how completely sexist the position was and how I was stuck in it. Just another day in the life of a woman. "

Firstly, I’M NOT A VIRGIN. Secondly, WHY DOES IT MATTER?! Thirdly, WHY DO YOU CARE?! I have no idea what I’ve done to illicit these rumours, and I now feel incredibly uncomfortable around the men in my workplace.

Until then, I’ll stay muted like the object you think I am. "

It read: “Would love to hook up.” She can’t even do her job without creeps deciding they have the right to sleep with her. "
"Last week I was walking home from a late night session with friends at 6 am. I thought it would be busy again in the city that time, but I entered a lonely street and there stood that guy, asking me for the direction to the train station, I pointed at it and walked faster, because I had that tummy feeling, that he wasn’t all harmless. Then he started following me and shouting things, that he wants me to stop and he wants to talk to me. Then thank god I saw a group of girls walking home, so I asked them to walk me home, because I was scared of that guy and they were very friendly and understood me. I was shaking for the next hour when I was home. Just a couple of days after that incident, I was at work (I work at a fruit and vegetable stand at the side of a road in the middle of nowhere) when I had two male customers, making jokes and one of them said ‘Watch out or I leave you here with her and drive on alone’ and the other guy said ‘Oh, I know what I would to with her.’ I was so furious inside, but I didn’t want to make a scene and stayed friendly the whole time, because I have the feeling it is easier then, and if I would tell them that that was inappropriate maybe I would stir them up and there is nobody else than me at work, if something happened I would have been completely screwed. So I don’t feel save at all anymore, not in public, nor at work. These two incidents made me feel sick, disgusting, confused and insecure for the last whole week. "
"I need a new phone at work. The telecommunications installer just called to mansplain that I’d completed the wrong form. I told him I needed to know where the new form existed on our website. He said, “You’d better learn where it is, because that’s the way things are from now on.” Rather than tell him he was rude and risk retaliation, I raised the pitch of my voice and said, “Can I call you back? I have someone in my office.” "
In the office and the men are hilariously discussing that they “can’t afford another wife”. 
I was at work and was talking to my manager about applying for a full time role…he said I would be sure to get it if I turned up to the interview in a ‘short little dress’….THANKS BUT NO THANKS 
"Bunch of girls taking about having a scientific project together, not actually excluding anyone, just happened that all were women. A male colleague comes and asks: what are you planning now?

"The work that I do involves looking at naked women. Before you gasp with shock at my apparent depravity, please let me explain. I didn’t choose to look at naked women like a life drawing artist would, I sort of inadvertently stumble across women without many clothes on as I go about my work. I never signed up to look at naked women, it just sort of happened really. My work involves caring for animals. The creatures need newspaper to do their business on. This means that I have to open up various tabloids and rest assured, these volumes of journalism make brilliant toilet paper for the little creatures! Where I work is a family friendly environment, there are often children milling about and we have many school trips. For this reason, I have to hide the pages featuring naked women by either placing them faced down or covering them up with hay. I don’t think my boss would take too kindly to photos of naked women being on display to the public and their small children. I know these animals can’t read, but I do sometimes wonder what they’re thinking when they urinate on top of a photo of naked woman or when they defecate on top of a photo Donald Trump. That always makes me giggle and gets me through the day. Do animals interpret photographs like humans do? Anyway, there seems to be a lot of naked women in these newspapers and zero naked men. This doesn’t seem fair somehow. I used to know several young women who wanted to see certain male pop stars naked, so there does seem to be a potential untapped market here. I know that the women who strip off choose to do this: good luck to them if that’s what they enjoy and that’s how they want to make money. However, I’d much rather they did these sort of things either in private or in periodicals covered by a brown envelope. There is stuff that cannot be shown in family orientated environments. Maybe I live in a prudish society that says women should dress modestly to avoid ridicule. It’s far too cold in this country usually for people not to wear many clothes. I understand that people in the tropics wear so few clothes because it is hot. However, I always feel incredibly uncomfortable when I see a picture of a naked woman in a popular paper. Maybe I am insecure because I am a woman. I don’t know. Maybe I feel ashamed because women’s bodies are either sexualised or pathologised by society. Women’s bodies are judged on how they look. Men’s bodies by what they do. All that I know is that small children in our culture aren’t meant to see people that are starkers, so I have to conceal the evidence so I don’t get into trouble. Animals don’t need clothes, they have fur or whatever. They probably don’t even care about Donald Trump or naked female pop stars. I just wonder what’s going on inside their minds when they see those pictures. Naked women crop up elsewhere too when you least expect them. A male family member decided to look up his favourite rock band “The Barenaked Ladies” on the Internet so he could buy their new album. This band seemed to consist entirely of men (please correct me if I am wrong). However, much to my male relative’s disgust and dismay, his search results for the phrase “The Barenaked Ladies” yielded just that, ladies that were naked and well, bare. He wasn’t very happy at the imagery he was confronted with. He wanted to buy a music album, not stare a female nudes. Unfortunately, computers are very literal thinkers and the Internet is already chock full of pictures of naked women, so it was an accident just waiting to happen. "
"My mother’s cancer came back after being in remission for over a year this summer. This bout is tougher than the last time around and one that makes you have the feeling fuck cancer. Last time, I only had to take off a couple of days when she was laid up after her double mastectomy. This time, I’ve used over a week’s worth of sick time to be with her and take her to doctors’ appointments and therapy sessions. It’s become very tough to get the time off because my boss expects detailed justification on why I need it off. It’s very much a private matter and I don’t feel comfortable telling someone who isn’t family much more beyond the general she has an appointment. I honestly would have expected her to be more empathetic because when a former colleague’s husband was dying of cancer, she let the woman do whatever she wanted and gave her carte blanche for time off. She even went lax of her performance reviews because of the stress she was under. She’s also almost too lax as well with a male colleague who is a divorced father of multiple kids and an aging father whose health problems are partially his own fault. It’s as if he has a magic 8 ball of excuses that gets trotted out on a regular basis (dad is sick, I didn’t make an effort to get child care, etc). He got a flex schedule even though our current staffing situation and his job performance don’t merit it. Right now, we’re down one FT position at least for another couple months until a replacement gets hired. His job performance was barely adequate before, but is struggling to do his job now. I didn’t think his reduced appointment should have been renewed period until his job performance improved. Meanwhile, I’m being held to a higher standard because I’m a woman. It’s unacceptable for me to have some issues that I can try to fix when made aware of them. Instead, I’m subjected to one of my (female) boss’ bullying rants. I’ve mostly fixed the issue, but I’m not going to get any recognition beyond it’s your job. She had the nerve to tell me that I was being negligent and that it was the worse state that the area had been in ever. I had to hold back and not respond that it was a fucking mess when I took over because both my predecessor and the person doing it on a temporary basis had neglected it worse. I couldn’t get over how tactless and insensitive she was considering what I’ve been going through. I’m looking for other jobs because I know that I’m never going to be given the recognition I deserve. It’s tough being stuck with a coworker who only stays in the job for the benefits, even though he hates it. It’s one think griping privately with me, but it’s another whining to some of the students he’s supposed to be mentoring. I don’t like my job somedays but I don’t share it at work. I’ve started expressing my frustration with the sexism that I’ve encountered and that it doesn’t matter how good of a job you do, you only get rewarded and appreciated if you’re a male. "
"When listening to Laura Bates “Everyday Sexism” TED talk I started to recall time when sexism effected me, From ages as young as 12 Two years ago at a youth disco when a boy reached out and grabbed my boobs as I walked past, Every summer when my mother says my mid thigh shorts are too short and I wish I had listened when people stare at my legs as I walk down the street, Everyday while walking home from school holding down my knee length school skirt ” Just in case there’s a breeze” , While at work as a part-time waitress when customers stare at my breasts, comment on my figure or ask why a pretty girl like me isn’t wearing make-up When walking to meet friends while wearing heels and wishing I had wore more comfortable, suitable shoes “just in case ” I needed to run.

"Extract from a letter from HR after I asked them to address my constant exposure to pornographic images at clients’ sites: “…sexually explicit material … is subjective. Thatâ€™s why we cannot issue this matter explicitly in one of our policies. Again I am sorry I cannot do anything for you in this matter.” Exposure to sexually explicit material in the workplace is subjective, is it? I’m pretty sure there’s an EU Directive that says otherwise. Thanks for the support. "
"Many, many years ago, I was weeding a garden bed outside my workplace. I had my back to the road. Car pulls up at the corner, driver wolf-whistles at me. I ignore it, thinking they’ll go away if I don’t react (so naive!). It continues, four or five times. I look as the car drives away. It was someone I worked with. I regret not confronting him about it and I didn’t mention it to our manager either. "

"Coworker was added by someone he didn’t know on LinkedIn. The request was from someone named Chris and had a man/woman couple in the profile picture. Coworker then said that was annoying, because he couldn’t tell if Chris was a man or a woman. I asked him why it mattered if they were a man or a woman. (If he cared about the gender it means that he would treat them differently depending on the gender, something that is very in line with his past behavior.) He didn’t have a answer, and kind of stumbled around for a bit. My manager was there, looked at the profile, said “Well, it says they founded a company so I think we know the answer!” and then started laughing. "

A customer, in his late 40s probably and his 18 year old son came up to me whilst I was cleaning low shelves (I happened to be on my knees as I cleaned). “Careful love, theres a few things I could say about that position” I ignored to which he asked why I had different uniform. I explained that I was waiting for new ones to arrive. “Blimey why you so fat, need to be more careful love! Bet you were a lovely size 8 when you started” "
"Weekly campaign manager call with boss where we all go over our accounts. We are seven and I’m the only woman. The boss asked me to take notes for the call. I asked if it was because I was a woman. He stuttered, said no, said never mind he would do it himself. A couple hours after the call he messaged me that my response was inappropriate and that he is not sexist and that in the future I should have those discussions with him privately. He was upset. I wonder if what really bothered him was that I’m a girl (woman)…I’m supposed to be nice and collaborative and helpful. I’m not supposed to make anyone uncomfortable or call anyone out. The thing is he didn’t ask any of the men on the team to take notes after I declined. I guess that idea never crossed his mind, but it’s not like that’s sexist or anything, is it? I made a point of calling it out. It is my responsibility to call it out, and give it a name, and create awareness, and plant a seed. "
"So I had to do an induction for a security guard at my workplace (a student housing company) who was really weird from the start. Kept asking me inappropriate questions such as when am I getting married and having kids as I have to do this before 30 apparently (WTF?!). I am at work alone but thankfully have a security alarm that rings through to our emergency centre should I pull the cord, he keeps looking at my chest constantly and touching my arm, shoulder etc and being generally odd by getting as close to me as possible. Tells me he better call his wife and tell her he isn’t having sex with someone else, (WTF?!) Finally go to leave and go to shake his hand, he grabs it and kisses it. Fucking creep. "
"I work assisting colleagues welfare when they are experiencing mental illness or other challenges.

"I was 14 and working as a camp counselor. The camp director was a boorish man in his 40s – married, both kids at the camp – and he seemed to have a thing for me. Kept calling me to his office alone…thankfully I had the good sense to never enter the office, and just stayed in the doorway and refused to sit down. One day my co-counselor had a family emergency, and I was left alone with the kids. We were rehearsing for the talent show – they were on the stage, I was leaning against the stage. The camp director heard I was alone and came up behind me, pushing himself into my back, rubbing my breasts up and down a few times – all in front of 8 and 9 year old girls. It was horrible. I told my mother, and she told me not to be “one of those women” claiming sexual harassment at the workplace. "
"A greeting kiss has become common place between colleagues/clients and I am interested why women get a kiss and men don’t? I also feel annoyed at how some women don’t get what being objectified means for them, like being sexy is the only game in town. Over the past few years I have gone through a process of de-sexualising myself and although it felt strange at first (which I took as a sign of how engrained it is) I feel free to explore what being feminine is really about. Sexism isn’t just a man to woman thing, I feel it’s a woman to woman thing too – if women don’t start seeing themselves differently, and realising some of the sexist things we seem to have embodied. I think change will take a lot longer. "
"As prep for a work assignment where i would be at sea with 90 men and 4 women, the head of HR for the program called me in to talk. None of the men were asked to meet with her. It makes the story even worse that this came from a woman. Let’s call her Sandy. Sandy told me a story about 2 women that had been in a similar assignment. One woman didn’t socialize with the men very much and she carried her bible everywhere and was frequently seen reading from it during off hours. The other woman socialized with the men and joked around (being one of the guys). Sometime during the 2 year assignment the social woman was harassed by one of the men and a sexual harassment complaint was filled. The HR rep went in to tell me that non social woman never had this type of issue. She proceeded to advise me not to suffer the fate of the woman that was harassed. She was saying that boys will be boys. I was mortified by her advice. I have a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering. I earned the right to take on the technical challenge that I was about to embark on. Now I have an HR person telling me that I shouldn’t hang out with my co-workers because they may get the wrong idea and they may not be able to control themselves. Give me a break!! She told me to try to keep to myself. It was a two year assignment!! Again, none of the men going on the same assignment were brought in for a speech like this. (this was a group of non-military engineers going out to sea). i have a ton of stories like this that i’ve experienced throughout my career. i keep chugging along trying not to loose hope. "
"When I was in high school, I was active in a church youth group that would go to a summer camp every year. The cost of the camp was pretty high, so our leaders started offering ways for us to earn money towards our camp funds. One of the ways I could earn money for camp one year was to serve in a concession stand at a large conference in Indianapolis. I, with other girls in my youth group, served at the same concession stand just a few feet away from some vendors. We were wearing Polo shirts and black pants as a uniform. Throughout most of the day, I noticed an older man, maybe 50-60 years old, staring at me from across the alley. Eventually, he came up to the counter. I thought he was going to order food, but the first thing he said to me was, “You and I could make beautiful children.” He was glaring at me and leaning very close to me on the counter. I was appalled and so disgusted at his comment that I couldn’t even think of anything to say. I sat there, shocked into silence. Starting to sound angry, he said, “Don’t you agree?” One of the girls with me noticed I was uncomfortable and said, “Is there a problem?” He glared at my friend and shouted at her, “I just said that we would make beautiful children! Does she even speak English!?” And then he walked away. I shook and cried because I had never had anyone treat me like that before. I was 16. And I’m also half Filipino, so the fact that he verbally assaulted me and then attacked my ability to speak English when I didn’t respond to his disgusting comment is beyond me. It’s deplorable that there are people out there who think saying things like this are okay. "
"They say that young girls are more terrified of getting fat than they are of nuclear war. I am honestly more terrified of nuclear war, but that is probably because I am fat already. In so called self esteem campaigns, a lot of girls are unfairly shown as being obsessed with their bodies and ignoring world issues. Girls are being encouraged by these “self esteem campaigns” to focus on their own appearances by telling them they are “beautiful” or “pretty”, which just leads to a vicious circle of girls obsessing over their appearance and “self esteem” thus ignoring the rest of the world. These “self esteem campaigns” for girls are actually very sexist because they perpetuate the stereotype that girls are all “pretty” and appearance focussed. Instead of these campaigns, how about mentoring girls on how to plant trees in their communities or build circuit boards? Why does everything to do with girls have to be focussed on how they look? Lots of men don’t wear make-up or obsess over their looks and yet many of them contribute scientific discoveries! It seems disingenuous to me for women wearing conventional make-up to tell girls that they can authentically “be themselves”. Men get to be themselves all the time and contribute by not wearing make-up, wearing stripey jumpers with holes in them and some of the men have very messy hair! Why can’t women? I have never ever seen a woman with messy hair, ragged clothes and no make-up presenting these self esteem “be yourself talks”. It is probably because women like this are far too busy in the lab making discoveries, or in garage doing something physically useful to help other people! Maybe these women are doing useful things because they are not obsessed with being “authentically beautiful”? What about women who can’t afford many “nice” clothes? Why are women and girls being told to boost their self esteem by wearing “nice clothes” by other women? Women can be sexist and classist towards each other too even in the name of “self esteem” and “self help”. A lot of these “self esteem” sessions for girls seem to want to guilt trip them into buying “nice clothes” or a particular brand of soap. "
"I work in a bar, where the manager was great when I started. But over the months it has gotten really bad, to the point that I am now, among other things, dressed down as being ‘disrespectful’ when I show any assertiveness (ie, stating intention to try out products for menu drinks, as opposed to asking permission, which is never expected of the male bartenders). Plus side: I quit the job because no workplace like that deserves a badass lady bringing in female clientele. Period, the end. "
"I use to work the occasional wine gig (set up at a grocery store or similar event and pour samples of wine). On the very first gig I did outside of my usual wine circle (where my status as sommelier and wine expert is well known) an Indian man in his mid forties comes up to the table. He is my very first guest. Now, I’m on the skinny side. I know this because I’ve been on the skinny side my entire life. It runs in the family and is just how my body is. Naturally it’s a sore subject because naturally it’s the first thing to be picked apart (by school yard bullies or random guys). Having dealt with the issue since grade school, I know the signs of when someone is gathering up the muster to tell me I’m not at approved weight for them. Sure enough this man walks up already turning over in his head how he’s going to approach the subject. I poured this man his samples and start discussing the wine and sure enough he starts veering the conversation toward how thin I am. I laugh it off, saying its my naturally high metabolism and would he like to try the Pinot noir next? He agrees and goes on about my weight, ignoring the hint. He says he’s a doctor and he’s very concerned for me. I laugh again, tell him my doctor gives me a clean bill of health every check up and here’s the last red wine, hope you enjoy it. He stands around, asking for another sample flight and continues telling me how concerned he is for me as a doctor. I’m gritting my teeth at this point, trying to keep my fake smile on and telling him since he’s gone through two rounds of samples I really must be getting to my other guests. He stands back, waits for them to finish and then continues attacking my weight which I keep trying to brush off. Finally he walks off and I think that’s the end of it. Nope. He was just waiting for the crowd to die down so he could get more of my attention. He asks for a third round and continues to tell me how very unhealthy it is to be omg so very skinny and he’s a doctor and he knows how very bad it is to be so very skinny. Finally I had it. I dropped the smile, glared at him and told him “doctor or not, my health is not your concern. My health is my concern and my doctors concern. You’re not my concern. You’ve reached your limit. I can’t pour you any more. Have a good day.” That finally made him leave, but it was unbelievable how much effort it took. The vendor next to me watched the whole thing in horror. She asked if I got it a lot. I told her, more than you would think and always from middle age guys. "
"After playing live on a radio show, in which I accompanied a middle aged male guitar player for a 30 minute segment, the radio host complimented us as we were leaving the studio. To my male musical partner, he offered praise for his musicianship and his ability to always assemble a great band and bring spectacular musicians onto the show. To me, he offered: “You really are a lovely girl, what a beautiful smile.” "
"Warning: mention of domestic violence My last job was a combination of retail/customer service and custom cut industrial materials (using stationary tools like a table saw, bandsaw, router, etc). It was a chain store and I was the only woman who worked there in the entire state. Many customers would refuse help from me, assuming that I was stupid and knew nothing about the products sold or how to cut or construct things. They would actively ignore me, seeking help from any of my other male coworkers. My manager would refer to me in conversation with male customers as nice to look at. To combat this kind of attention I attempted to dress as androgynously as possible. I had short hair and one (male) customer asked me if I had cancer, as if that is something appropriate to ask someone you don’t know while they’re at work. I have a large birthmark on my arm and one day another (male) customer told me that I should get it covered with a tattoo. Every day at work my manager and coworkers listened to this one radio show (you could hear the radio throughout the entire store). It was a dude show with all these dudes bro-ing out with one another, often talking about how wives suck, women are lying bitches, etc etc. They would talk about sexual situations on the show as well. My coworkers were all friends prior to working at this place and would talk about their relationships with women. When one of them was out of the room they would talk about how his girlfriend was a drunken whore, when another of them was out of the room they would talk about how his girlfriend’s vagina smelled like fish (!???). Shortly before I quit my manager was arrested and conditionally released for assault. This freaked me out since he always had a short temper. Curious, I did some online digging about him. He had told me on several occasions that his brother had passed away and implied that his brother’s wife had contributed to his passing. Looking online I found out that his brother had in fact murdered his pregnant wife, fled the scene and crashed his car, killing himself. This is why sexist beliefs are not innocuous. My manager’s brother murdered his wife and my manager somehow rationalized that it was her fault. If women are bitches then you don’t have to value their brains, their bodies, or their lives. "
"I am a scientist, and from time to time I post pictures on my social media about what I am currently studying or working on. This week I posted some electrical components and someone, a friend in fact asked me what my boyfriend was building. I responded and said it was mine and I also said that it was sexist for him to say it was my boyfriends. To which he replied that he wasn’t sexist. Then while telling my other male friend about the injustice he also told me it wasn’t sexist and then I came home and told my bf who also explained to me that it wasn’t sexist. "
Anyone noticed that women who are strong in business get described as ‘ball breakers’ or ‘feisty’? No such terms for men – yet we have to put up with these derogatory ways of describing strength of character and confidence in the workplace. 
"I was working as a waitress the night of the 2016 presidential election. We had only one customer, an older man who was watching the news on the diner TV. Election coverage brought up the “locker room talk” tapes. The customer ensured me that the comments didn’t make Trump unfit to be president and that he used to grab girls around my age, too. I had to bring him beers for the rest of the night as he would only receive service from me. I Ubered home that night because I was afraid to walk back alone. "
I’m a trainee solicitor in my 20s and was at Court with a colleague representing a female client. When discussing the terms of an Order the 40 something successful barrister on the other side informed me he wouldn’t want to have sex with my client and joked he’d like to ‘take advantage of me’. I felt disgusted and unable to say anything. My colleagues still instruct him despite knowing the story. I have used a pseudonym. 
"In the women’s clothing department of Next, Charing Cross, London on a Saturday afternoon. There are a handful of other shoppers, predominantly female. There are three male workers, aged late 20s to mid 30s, putting out stock. They are talking about a female colleague who works at another branch – Cheapside – and her booty and how amazing it is, using sounds to suggest their approval of her bottom. I said “Are you honestly discussing a female and her body in a female clothes shop? How disrespectful, that is unbelievable.” Not one of them said a word. I walked out. I then decided to go back in to report it and was given an apology. "
"I’m an MA student working on a dissertation about stereotypes of hysterical women. My project focuses a lot on the everyday casual references people make to women being naggy, bitchy, whingy, whiny, shrill, over-emotional, hormonal, pms-ing, oversensitive etc- my argument is that all of these terms are actually references to a subliminal discourse of hysterical femininity as a second rate mind-state that underlies our culture, and that by drawing on them men can legitimise, by drawing on a history of other arseholes who do so too, their putting down, trivialising or laughing away serious, valid and legitimate comments or complaints that women make, or things they want to talk about that fall under the category of ‘female’ ’emotional’ topics, including feelings and, heavens forbid, periods. I happened to be reading a book for my project at work one day and was asked by a colleague what it was for. On explaining the topic, I was suddenly met with the comment that I was being an oversensitive bitch and wasn’t I looking a bit too far into things, words are just words. I rest my case. Yet he couldn’t see that he had proven my point. Most upsettingly, a female colleague then came and said she agreed with him, and I was looking too deeply into things… apart, from, that’s what language students do anyway, and it’s a perfectly valid argument. This guy has continued to tell me his very derogatory opinion about my project, including that there’s no point to it and I shouldn’t even be doing it, every time I see him, even though I have asked him to stop speaking about it with me because its very upsetting. I’m starting to think maybe he has something to prove, or to defend, or else why would he care so much about someone else’s dissertation? I’m refusing to let him bother me, because I know he is part of the problem that I am trying to stand up against, but just wanted to let anyone else with a similar arsehole who puts them down know that it isn’t anything you’re doing or saying, these people are just products of the cultural system that allows men to make such comments by providing such stereotypes for them to feel empowered by: they’re the people we need to re-educate. Also, just want to put a note out to say to everyone else on this site, don’t let anyone put down anything you want to say, or to talk about, on the grounds that it isn’t important, relevant, or useful, or that you’re being irrational, hysterical, hormonal or over-sensitive, just because you’re a woman- we have as much right to speak as men do, and the fact that we have wombs does not influence what we speak about or how we express it one iota.

"In work as a Police Officer, and some male colleagues were discussing the proposed changes to the law to make sexism a hate crime, along the lines of racism or homophobia. They all stated this was ridiculous, and one commented that he might has well be locked up now. I was very disappointed with their attitude, but as one of only two females present, and the other remaining tight lipped I felt unable to challenge this attitude. I do regularly pick my colleagues up on the use of slang terms for female gentialia being used in a derogatory manner, but all that has now happened is when they do it they add a quick ‘sorry’ on the end and continue!

"I am the only female employee in a team of four booksellers. Every time someone is looking for the manager, they ask me if HE is available. It is a bit vexing for me, as if I have an incompetent look or something about me that says that I cannot be the manager of the place. What is infuriating though is when I answer a question with my normal behavior (without smiles and flirtation) people tend to complain about my conduct to my manager. He desmisses it because he knows me and has seen how I interact with other human. But at other jobs they have asked of me to put up a friendlier appearance and a smile, no such demands are made upon my male colleagues though. So why should I seduce my clients ? I have exactly the same behavior as my colleagues but because I am a woman, people seem to think that enables them to require a certain type of conduct from me. And that is exausting and descriminating and insufferable. "

With a Bachelor’s in Kinesiology, a Physical Education teaching credential, multiple fitness industry approved certifications, and near 20 years of experience teaching and training in gyms and to private clients the principal of the school decided to give my job to a football coach with no education other than his being a football coach. I found myself relegated to being his assistant in the class room. On quite a few occasions I had to cover for his ignorance. Oh, and when the principal decided to build a new weight room he sat down with those who would be using it most to work up a design, but somehow forgot to invite me to those planning sessions even though I was the school’s only P.E. teacher and a coach of two sports.

In the middle of a negotiation with a Fortune 100 company, one of my organization’s VPs (1) interrupted me mid-sentence to “correct” me on a matter of law (he’s not an attorney and he was wrong); (2) blabbed our negotiating strategy while also mentioning that I had told him not to share the information outside of our organization and he thought that was silly (it wasn’t, and his blabbing adversely impacted our ability to negotiate); and (3) topped it off by calling me “sweetie” and “honey” a few times.

"I am working at a film festival as a Public Relations’ assistant. I tell my boss I feel uncomfortable with a movie director because he asked for my number and insisted on taking me out for dinner. She tells me not to make a big deal and to go say hi. He asks if I can help him out to buy a new shirt, my boss says yes. He asks to take a picture with me, he starts tickling me, I get out of between his hands and my boss asks: having fun, huh? My boss takes me to the side and tells me that my face shows that I’m annoyed, and that I have to try and hide it better. I am 22, my boss is a 32 year old woman, and the man is 42. "
"Being asked to work on a new project with a male lead, I asked him for a meeting in order to gather information about the project. He tells me a few things when I ask specific questions but nothing very important. 2 days later he has a meeting with my boyfriend who works in the same company. The male lead spills the beans about every detail of the project, the strategy, the political decisions behing the planning of the project, who is what, what he wants to do, everything. Most of the questions my boyfriend asked were the same I had asked previously. My boyfriend then gave me all the answers the male lead hadn’t given me. It is going to be a fun collaboration. "
"I work in a restaurant and bar, and the general environment in my workplace is male dominated. Of the 16 members of staff, 4 are female, and we routinely have to deal with sexist comments and jokes made at our expense. I most commonly experience this from the chefs that I work with on a daily basis. All male, they will often make sexual jokes towards me and my colleges, and nothing along this line of comedy is out of bounds. I have had them make jokes at me about my sex life, how I keep my body (they have guessed that I would have a bush, while my friend would be bald and the cleaner would have an ‘axe-wound’ – to our faces) , and even the way I look and how that reflects my personality. I am either ‘mumsy’ or a complete ‘dick muncher’. It is sad but I am used to this by now, and have found that the best way in my situation to deal with it is to either ignore them or joke back and join in the ‘banter’, but better women than me have left due to comments made. While this general behavior upsets me, the sexism arrives when the chefs have routinely not made a joke along political or racial lines when I am in the room because that’s ‘not what a woman should hear’. They truly believe they are being gentlemen in avoiding topics that could engage conversation on an intellectual level, but as women we are only seen as beings of sexual use, and not for our minds. This is what upsets me most, and they don’t even realize they’re doing it. "
"A fellow academic at an elite UK university told me today that she felt we should all wear a cardigan when lecturing students because a male student had complained that female lecturers wearing sleeveless tops were distracting. We have male academics who wear jeans to work, and none of the students have commented on this. I find this infuriating and now wear sleeveless (smart) tops everyday to work, even if I am cold. "
"Just like to send the Everyday Sexism Project a big apology for complaining the other day that you wouldn’t publish my post because I am transgender. I was totally wrong – sorry. I understand now that people email you so many instances of sexism that there is always a backlog of a few days and it takes time to catch up with it. That there is so much sexism around that there is always a long backlog of comments is shocking in itself. And that’s one of the helpful things about this site: that it shows to the world at large that sexism happens all the time and offers a platform to those who experience it to share what happened to them or someone they knew and to let others know how that made them feel. So, yeah, this site is definitely empowering – and not just paying lip-service to equality and diversity as sadly so many organisations and associations still do. Thank you for publishing my post and I’m really sorry I was wrong about you. Well done for producing a really good site. "
The Director over my department calls woman skirt 
"Pink is just a colour It’s funny how many young boys say that they would never play with pink coloured toys because society says that pink things are “for girls only”. Weird, considering the number of male teenagers and men who do tricks with pink yoyos and kendamas. These males talk about the technical specifications of their pink yoyo toys and perform tricks with them. At the turn of the century, parents dressed boys in pink because it was a lighter version of blood red (a fierce colour). Little girls were dressed in blue because Mary, the mother of Jesus was shown wearing blue. Also blue was considered to be a passive, calm colour for girls. So, the colour pink isn’t the issue but the label and codified meaning people give it. I was given a blue piece of equipment to use at work. A man jokingly asked if I would prefer to use a pink one. He meant no harm at all. He is a nice person who has helped me out many times and he was just being cheerful. I laughed and said that it basically made no difference what colour equipment I had. The job I do is very unglamorous anyway. There is a company that manufactures women’s DIY tools that come in pink and blue. The reason for the pink colouring is not to please the women, a company spokeswoman said, but to prevent males in women’s families from wanting to borrow their tools. Apparently, some people think that men will not use pink tools because the pink looks too “feminine” (watching men choose between different coloured DIY tools would make for an interesting social psychology experiment). So why do men use pink yoyos, but not pink hammers? I still can’t work it out. Unless some men honestly don’t care what colour stuff they have. One young girl explained in a PSHE video that when she “saw red” (got angry) that she would try and mix white with the red in her head to get pink. Clearly little girls are told from a young age that they should not express anger, but instead should bottle up their feelings and opinions by seeing codified feminine pink instead of angry red. The girl said that she was trying to calm herself down as part of PSHE. She didn’t explain the reason why she was angry just that (according to PSHE) she had been told that she should be calm at all times. This is disturbing because justified anger directed and expressed in constructive ways can be used as a catalyst for change. Girls seem to be encouraged to “think pink” from a young age and not get angry, whereas boys are encouraged to wear blue and red, and fight like pirates. What passes for school taught Emotional Intelligence these days seems to be teaching girls to think pink and not see red, instead of actually expressing why they are angry and discussing possible practical solutions to problems. Sorry, but this is why PSHE and emotional intelligence in schools are not fit for purpose. Perhaps if girls could be mentored to solve real problems in their communities instead of being told to “think pink and not red”, then they wouldn’t get so angry. Pink is just a colour. You don’t magically transform into a woman or a gay person (unless you are already like this) if you put on a pink shirt. Pink is just a colour. This pink shaming and associating pink with unicorns, females and rainbows is just strange given that it was considered like the colour of blood for young males 100 years ago. I have long given up trying to understand the hypocrisy of society and the “girls must have all pink toys” weirdness. I have lost count of the number of public women’s loos I walked into that were pink. The men’s toilets were, you guessed it, blue. I was given things with pink hearts on them as gifts for my Birthday because I was a little girl. All of the mirrors and combs and stuff for girls was pink. The girls’ ballet tutus were pink too. Boys never ever wore pink or played with pink toys at my old Primary School. "
Working as a bar tender in my early 20s a male patron commented on how much “head” (foam) was on his beer. Our taps were awful so I offerred to make him another one. He went on to explain that the head was fine just as long as I gave him some head afterward. I clearly looked offended at the request for oral sex but I removed him from the bar after he informed me that it would count as my tip. Unfortunately I got in a lot of trouble from management that shift for removing a paying customer. They didn’t seem to understand that sexual harassment in the workplace was wrong even when it was the customer and not a coworker doing it. 
I asked for a raise and my boss was baffled. He asked why I needed it when my husband makes enough money. 
"I live in a country where, when it”s someone’s birthday, it’s tradition for them for buy the round at the bar or to bring in some cake for their colleagues etc. So the other day, I remembered a colleagues birthday and, though I don’t really like this man because of his rude behaviour and constant tantrums and dishonesty, I decided to be kind and wish him a happy birthday. He promptly responded by telling me to “shut the fuck up. I don’t want anyone knowing so I don’t have to buy anything for them”. Later, I saw him simpering “thanks yous” with male members of management who, being in charge of his records etc, knew it was his birthday already. For that day and several days after, he would go out of his way to glare at me and be even ruder than usual to me because he was too dim to work out that they knew his birthday from employment records, not because I told them. He behaved like this for the same reason he’s usually shitty towards me; because he thinks as a woman I won’t speak up about it and that I wouldn’t be taken seriously even if I did. He treats our female colleagues in the same manner while he simpers and panders to our male colleagues. "
I’ve been asked by co-workers what I did sexually last weekend. When I refused to answer they said I was “frigid”. A manager told me I was taking too much time off for “just a little cramping”. Another manager told me I must be lying because “all women lie” to him. 
"I constantly serve older men at work (clothes shop) who make inappropriate comments. Today one said, after I apologised for a colleague and I taking a while to sort out a gift card, not to worry as he was ‘enjoying the nice view’ and proceeded to creepily stare at us. After, his friend told him to hurry and he said “hang on, I’m still feasting on the beauty” and smirked. Another time I was taking the trousers off a mannequin and an old man said “No one’s done that to me in a while” made me feel sick both times and I was too shocked/embarrassed to say anything. Just because you’re an OAP it doesn’t mean this can be classed as innocent banter/cheeky fun. Inappropriate is inappropriate and it isn’t ok to make someone feel this way in their workplace. "
"Men constantly staring at my breasts, in the workplace and n the street… Have they no control of their eyeballs even? "
"I work in a fairly traditional (see religious) workplace. My position, however, requires that I have professional credentials and a graduate degree. Nonetheless, I have been asked on numerous occasions if I can “jump on reception,” “run and make photocopies” or “quickly grab coffee for so-and-so who’s in a meeting”. Men with far fewer credentials and less education are never asked to do the same. Most of these requests come from other women in my organization. Maybe it’s my fault for expecting professional courtesy and respect in an environment that is by its very nature restrictive for women but somehow, in 2013, that excuse doesn’t fly with me. "
I’ve been at my current job for nearly 3 years. I work in the very male dominated industry of paint manufacturing. For the first time today an old man shook my hand and said thank you. All day every day I see the men shaking hands. This makes me feel quite uncomfortable to be excluded and not being considered worthy enough of deserving a handshake. The male practice of hand shaking is another example of casual misogyny that really isn’t that casual. It made me feel quite good when the man shook my hand today. I felt worthy. 
"I’m sick of all my tech/ programming teachers, relatives, and peers telling me I’ll definitely get a job in computers “because you’re a girl” not “because you’re good with computers” "
"Was at an accountancy seminar yesterday, during a presentation which covered, amongst other things, how to boost your profile on LinkedIn, the speaker showed us pictures which he said could be improved on (not professional enough, etc etc) and asked the audience for comments. A picture of a woman at a desk prompted the comment from a man in the audience that she was probable about to stop work and make the kids’ teas. "
"I watched a coworker (against all safety rules) climb up on a swivel chair to reach some equipment that was on a high shelf. I said, “That’s not safe. You should stop.” He responded, “Chill out, woman.” "
"I was 18, working at a festival selling food. A mid 40’s, male, ‘youth liaison’ police officer, with roughly seven of his peers ordered food. Whilst I was making his meal he came up to me and handed me his card, he had written his number on the back. “What are you doing after work, can I drive you home?” I looked up at him shocked, then one of his peers, also a police officer chimed in “his car is nice and spacious if you know what I mean” and winked, to which all seven of them started laughing. I was so horrified about being ganged up on by several police officers making sexually explicit comments that I mumbled something about having my own car and it being ‘plenty big enough’. When they left I found out that the one who gave me his number had asked my boss if I was ‘a legal age’ before he approached me. My boss did nothing to support me in this situation but laughed the encounter off. I didn’t know I had a right to report this sort of behavior at the time, I was quite young and needed someone to tell me that sort of behavior wasn’t okay. I wish I could go back and confront or report this man now. "
"My workplace, an arts centre, sells colouring books for kids in the foyer. Different ones with “For Boys” and “For Girls” printed on the covers. The Boys’ one has all the exciting pictures: helicopters, tanks, lions, tigers, frogs, whales, spaceships, dinosaurs – basically, all the stuff I’d have loved as a kid. The Girls’ colouring book has nothing but flowers, princesses and butterflies. Yawn. It’s sad when limits are placed on children’s imagination according to gender. "
"I was at a wedding of a friend as her bridesmaid. Towards the end of the evening the photographer was flicking through the photos on his camera and showing them to a small group. I had a look and thought they were great. I asked him what camera he was using and he looked at me patronisingly before saying, ‘It’s nothing to do with the camera, darling.’ One of the groomsmen then chimed in, ‘Yeah, I used to hate people asking me that question when I was a photographer.’ I walked away immediately as I was just too annoyed to tell them that I’m a filmmaker – I run my own production company and enjoy discussing the relative pros and cons of different cameras. Their dismissal of my question and assumption of my ignorance made my blood boil, but it was a wedding and we were all having a great night, so in the end I didn’t pick them up on it. "
"I worked in a shop, and one male customer was very happy with the service. So happy, apparently, that he refused to leave the shop until he could kiss my hand, despite the lighthearted protests and faux telling offs I was permitted to react with while at work. When I could no longer raise my intensity of rejection without breaking protocol I gave him my hand and winced as he completed his emotional and physical manipulation. "
"When I began working in commercial kitchens as a line cook in my early 20s, I was under the impression that my mother’s generation had corrected the issues of sexism and we had indeed come a long way, Baby. But I was wrong and I took me an embarrassing amount of time to get the realities through my thick skull. I thought that if I worked hard, did my job well, and proved myself I would earn the respect of the men I worked with. Well, of course, I was terribly mistaken. Kitchens are still not a meritocracy. Being the only girl on the line, I did realize I would have to be just as good and even better than my male coworkers. I was surprised by the push-back I encountered. My male bosses and kitchen managers took deep offense if anyone, a waiter, another line-man, or a general manager praised me. However, the offended parties were very subtle in how they then went about undermining me. I would be called into the kitchen office and berated for minor mistakes like not cleaning something as well as I should’ve, not being able to lift the vat of oil back into the fryer after cleaning it without help, not wearing a bra on a few occasions, and even (so they said) not looking happy and chipper enough while working hard. I had to deal with rampant sexual comments and dirty talk by learning to talk like a sailor myself. I had to be self-deprecating when it was uncalled for. I was assigned the dirtiest jobs on the hardest stations while all the men in the kitchen were at the bar having their shift beers. I was hazed and felt up and took it in stride. I was also very confused. If I was doing my job well, why give me “the business”? Why undermine me by talking behind my back to the front of the house? Why make comments about my not wearing enough makeup in a hot kitchen? Why the eye rolling and nastiness? The unkindest cuts of all involved sabotage. In one Italian restaurant, the AC went out and we all labored under sweltering conditions in July. Myself and the other woman on the line were approached by the regional owner ( a big Italian fellow in a shiny suit) and he made a big show of apologizing directly to the two of us for the conditions in front of all the kitchen staff, because he thought we were too sensitive and therefore weak to endure adverse conditions. We were fine. We were doing our jobs well and efficiently. Our stations were meticulously clean. It was insulting. When the general manager at the same restaurant was on his honeymoon, I took over the job of cashier (we didn’t use a computerized system at the time). Exactly $100 went missing from the till. I was blamed and browbeaten and threatened with firing. I later learned that the $100 was taken from the strongbox under the register for which I had no key or access. The manager friend he left in charge had taken it (a banded bunch of ones) straight from the box. He was buying cocaine with it. I was framed as the scapegoat and berated in front of the entire staff. At several other jobs male coworkers let slip how much they were making per hour. Despite having seniority, more experience, and being objectively a better worker and placed on the most demanding stations, I was making far less. When I subsequently spoke with the boss about a 25 cent per hour raise to begin to fix the situation, I was laughed out of the office. My female coworkers (the few that were back there) were also paid significantly less. I was disappointed and flabbergasted. It didn’t make sense from a practical or business standpoint. Why torpedo and alienate valuable staff? Why shoot yourself in the foot? I gave a weeks notice after one refused (and very minor) request for a raise. The two managers and the owner called me to the bar where they were drinking and told me if I didn’t work out a full two weeks notice they would not act as references for me. It was in this way they expressed that they indeed needed me; it would be hard to find an adequate replacement for me even though I offered to leave only after I had trained my replacement. They said I had a bad attitude. I had an ANGRY attitude. I had been wronged, but they clearly didn’t see it that way. While they showed me no appreciation for work they had highly praised only weeks previous, I was the one who was “leaving them high and dry.” I understand now that men use their jobs to reinforce their manhood and when a woman coworker out-cooks them, they are threatened and feel emasculated. Why dies this have to be a zero-sum game? Can’t both male and female cooks be good at their jobs and share praise? Does the presence of a competent woman on the line automatically mean that the men are made lesser by us? The ultimate irony in all this is the pervasive idea that women are valuable and exclusive cooks in the realm of domesticity, but once you pay a woman to cook, men must always feel that they are better at it. Women are valued as cooks as long as they aren’t getting paid for it. "
"I find it depressing that it’s ‘normal’ to be heckled by random men when walking down the street alone outside my workplace. The other day I tried to sit on a bench and eat a sandwich at lunchtime in the sun. This pleasant experience was ruined by a guy with a dog – dog came over to me, the guy said something like: ‘Yeah Rover, I would too, clever boy!’ I wish I’d asked him to repeat himself but was too embarrassed and annoyed. These comments make you feel so violated, I can’t believe guys think it’s funny. I was in a hoodie, jeans and no make-up – although it’s worrying that I think this sort of thing should be somehow more expected if you’re dressed nicely. What’s that about? "
"In work as a Police Officer, and some male colleagues were discussing the proposed changes to the law to make sexism a hate crime, along the lines of racism or homophobia. They all stated this was ridiculous, and one commented that he might has well be locked up now. I was very disappointed with their attitude, but as one of only two females present, and the other remaining tight lipped I felt unable to challenge this attitude. I do regularly pick my colleagues up on the use of slang terms for female gentialia being used in a derogatory manner, but all that has now happened is when they do it they add a quick ‘sorry’ on the end and continue! "
"Just had to share this one – male opponent replying to my submissions in court: “My lords, Miss X beguilingly took you through the law in a charming attempt to explain why her argument was correct…” and a recent example of a similar thing experienced by a colleague: “Miss Y tried to allure you with her argument – you should resist her siren call”. What’s wrong with “Ms X’s argument may seem convincing, but it is wrong because …”? "
"Walking to and from a meeting room with my friend at work minding our own business. Friend is eating a rice cake – a fucking rice cake for crying out loud, not that it matters – and the Receptionist calls over “you shouldn’t be eating you’ll get fat”. Just. Fucking. Astounded. "
When I was 18 living on my own for the first time and at my job a strange man in his 50-60s sat down in front of me before spreading open his long coat and flashing me with his penis. I walked away. It shocked me but I didn’t even think to turn him in. It was the look on my face that caused a co-worker (male and also aged 50-60s) to ask what was wrong and when I told him he physically removed the other man from the workplace. I remember being given an extra break and not even knowing why they would offer extra time for me to stop working. 
"I am an archaeologist who works on very active construction sites. There have been a few occasions that I have been the only woman on site and normally that’s ok. 99% of the men I work with are very friendly and we get along very well. I have never had any directly sexist comments (yet) but I have had a lot of things suggested to me under the guise of banter. One man sitting in a digger to his friend ‘can you believe that this little girl digs” Me ‘This little girl works very hard’ ‘If you worked in an office you wouldn’t be so tired you know and you could go out clubbing more’ ‘How are you not married?’ ‘You’ve not done that much work today love’~ I had moved several tonnes of Earth by hand ‘Is that a bit heavy for you? Shall I get one of the men to do it?’ Me ‘yout ok they might brake a nail’ ~ I was carrying an A3 MDF board at the time ‘Hi smiler’ The ultimate classic was the overall site manager refusing to talk to me or acknowledge my presence on site. I could also spend hours talking about the battle I have had to have the women’s toilet unlocked and/or have the keys for them. Some site managers expect women to ask to use the toilet like little girls. It is difficult as a woman in a male dominated environment to kick up a fuss about the little things least you get branded as a trouble maker, these comments have all happens with no one else in ear shot making them hard to report and deal with. But I am not going anywhere. "
"After being 17+ years in the workplace, including factory shopfloors, in the field with sales teams, travelling 100+ kilometers in a day for work, being pregnant while working, bringing up a child, being a divorced single mother for over five years, and still making it up the career ladder. Recently while I was interviewing for a senior position, I was asked if I was sure I could manage the commute to work, since its tough on men, for a working mother, it would be really difficult…that was the end of my interest in the company "
"I have had multiple experiences. First in the workplace as a 17 yr old girl, men calling me baby doll, sweet cheeks, cutie, then proceeding to grab both my ass cheeks during a call where I wasn’t able to say anything. I felt shocked and not prepared for response. Another work place a few years later, a coworker coming up behind me and touching my shoulders, saying creepy inappropriate things. I told my manager about him and 5 other girls spoke up as well, the man was then pulled into a meeting and warned immediately within a day. That felt really good to tell someone and see action take place. One of the last but more major incidents was on the subway. Crowded, during rush hour, a gent that was quite near kept rubbing against my leg. At first I thought he was just moving with the train but then the motions began. He was rubbing his penis against me to masturbate. The motions of pushing the yellow emergency bar didn’t not cross my mind (they were also not within reach) I just wanted out of there, so I left at the next station. After talking about it with some friends, I decided to report him to the police. This is when I found out he was on the news already for sexually assaulting women on the train. After a few weeks they caught the man and he was charged with multiple accounts of sexual assault. If it happens to me again, I will cause a scene and I will feel no guilt about it, as I know that he will get caught and not do it to anyone of my fellow sisters out there. This website makes me want to approach the school board and start a program that gives women and girls (as it happens at young ages) the tools and skills to fight back with their words, bring awareness to the issue, and give them the confidence and strength to deal with what has happened to them.

"My sister works in a restaurant and the team of chefs (mostly male, 1 female pastry chef), are constantly discussing sex, conquests, dirty jokes etc. They normally aren’t physical, but my sister is concerned that the workplace has become very uncomfortable for many of the staff. No one feels they can complain because it is a family business and the owner would just have a chat with the chefs which would result in them being good for a week or so, then returning to their old ways. There isn’t any formal disciplinary procedure and the ‘lads’ in the kitchen act as if it’s their right to have some fun by essentially harassing the female staff. I personally never minded a bit of silly sexy jokes/flirting (I can objectify a guy and have been a flirt when it’s reciprocated – it works both ways), but when someone is upset by it, then it’s time to draw the line.

"– We went to a restaurant as a family and although I requested the bill, when the waiter returned, he went straight to my husband. – When we moved to the neighborhood with our then one year old son, my husband was asked, what he’s doing for a job frequently. Nobody asked me. – Men at work rush forward to hold the door open. – At a job interview I was asked whether I wanted more children – At HR department, I am asked, what I do with my children while I work. Nobody asks my husband. – People comment on my son’s cool hairstyle (he has an ordinary boy’s haircut) when he wears his favorite dress. It doesn’t even occur to people that he is a boy. – My husband and I share the parental leave time we have for the children and I have to sign a paper saying that I “allow” him to stay at home and that he gets “my” payed months even though I explicitly applied for less months than I could right from the beginning. When I asked at the office why I had to sign this, they looked up my applied for months on their computer and claimed that I applied for more months than I did. This happened twice so far and I expect it will happen again. "
"On a hot day I chose not to wear tights with my skirt. My male coworker repeatedly asked me who I was making an effort for, made snarky comments every time I spoke to another male colleague, and told me that I had dressed that way because I had been complimented by a guy the previous day, which had apparently ‘given me the confidence’. It didn’t seem to cross his mind that there could by any other reason for me dressing that way than to impress a guy. He never thought that maybe that’s what I wanted to wear that day, that I could make decisions based on how I felt that morning, and that every choice I made was FOR ME. Oh and fyi it’s actually less of an effort NOT putting tights on. The situation completely caught me off guard – I was shocked that in 2016 I was being asked to justify my choice of outfit to someone else. The worst part was the feeling that in future I might think twice before picking my outfits to avoid any more snide comments, but I am determined not to be affected by the comments of such small-minded, uneducated individuals. Some food for thought is that when I was telling my male friend about the incident, he initially didn’t understand why I had been so offended, and it took further explaining until he understood the points I was making. It seems even the most well-intentioned people may still not fully understand these kinds of issues… "
"A guy I trusted tricked me and raped me in the butt. I made a report, but the NY District Attorney refused to call me, refused to talk to me. After seven months of trying to get a meeting through my lawyer, I began to call myself, begging for services. They put me in jail for 15 days for a psychological evaluation. They just held me in Rikers Island. Then they said if I contacted them again I would be charged with harassment. He tells everyone I just wanted him. He was ugly with a small pecker. I thought he was nice. He tricked and exploited me and I”m still suffering, but I’m not allowed to discuss my suffering. Not allowed one conversation, called delusional, and jailed for trying to access help and public services. To this day, he still harasses and so far, I just have to be afraid and traumatized.

"Some wonem I have worked with have laughed at the sexist vibe, inappropriate comments and other ‘gestures’ of ‘sexually transmitted interst’ only to say “Oh it’s harmless enough. I have had to point out on MORE THAN ONE occasion that it is ‘not alright’ the more they say nothing the more they condone it. Things like this multiply, what starts as a comment, becomes a leer, a touch, an ingratious fondle. The more we ignore it the more it rears its ugly head. More people need to speak out, not just females, more people need to take action, in teh workplace, in life in general. From company policy to procedures for reprimand. The time is now (and always has been) a time for respect. If ever there was a case for women (in particular) learning self defence, then this is it. Having the self belief to stand up to people who perpetrate these crimes (yes CRIMES) the internal fortitude to make a solid stand and the aiblity to fearlessly move forward in a bid to make our lives more openly liveable then this is it. Not sustained violence, merely the ability to make a short sharp shock reverberate and shake the confidence of the perpetrator. "
Being called a ‘good girl’ by my manager at work when I’m a 24 year old supervisor 
"I work for an IT company. I work mainly with male colleagues. These are just a few examples of what I face every single day. My boss once told me that he only hires ugly women, so that the men working for him do not get distracted. And that usually ugly women are the only ones who look for a job anyway, because beautiful women are more clever and they find rich men who can give them whatever they want without the need to have a job. We have table football in my office, to play during lunch break. When the company’s manager is in town, he stops by and have a match with my colleagues. He always comes in asking for “the boys” to join him. Once, I asked him to play with me too, since I can play very well. He replied saying “I don’t think any of us wish to play in the woman’s squad”. A few days ago, a customer asked me if he would be able to upload a file in a system by himself or if he could have asked for my support to do it. One of my colleagues replied in my place, saying “Well, if Giulia (which is me) can do it, I guess anybody can”. "
"I’m an architect working in London. I’m also very young looking and blond on top of it. In a field which is supposed to be a ‘man’s world’ this is sometimes a bit tricky position to be in. Luckily enough, when I go to site, all the builders I’ve ever worked with are just fantastic and professional. However, it did happen to me several times, that when I was supposed to join a meeting with engineers who didn’t know me, as I entered the meeting room, they would start ordering coffee from me without any hesitation. Like the only thing I could possible be is an assistant who makes coffee for everyone. It surprised me but I took the orders, went to the kitchen, made the coffee, brought it to the meeting room and set down with my drawings to join the discussion. You should see their faces! "
"Some middle-aged male colleagues were discussing Great British Bake Off. One said “I’ve never watched it”, at which point I, a woman in early 30s, said “me neither”. One man looked surprised find said “I thought it’d be right up your street”. I was too surprised to ask why he thought that so I just said “I don’t really like baking” and then the conversation quickly moved on to something else. The thing is, if I had ever taken homemade cake to work or talked about a passion for baking, then this comment would be fine – but I’ve never done either of these things. So I can only assume it’s because I’m female. And if my collegue can make assumptions about me because I am a woman, I now wonder what other things he, and possibly other male colleagues are assuming about me, and do they/will they treat me differently because of it?! I already worry that because of my age and the fact I am recently married that my colleagues assume I am more interested in being a wife and one day a mother than in my career (which is not true at all) and therefore feel I have had (and will have to in the future) fight more for chances to progress at work then a man. Comments like this only re-enforce that feeling for me. "
"When I was 15 and working at my very first job, my married boss, twice my age, chased me around the workplace constantly. He’d say things like “Come over here and sit on my lap and let’s talk about the first thing that pops up.” I was 15. It was my first job. It was 1970. I’ve been a feminist ever since. "
"I’m a bilingual American German professor (PhD in German Studies) and something happens to me on a regular basis that apparently never happens to my male colleagues (according to them).

We come out to do the practical test, he looks at me and tells me: “You look very cute with your hard hat”. It took me by such surprise the only thing I could say was “that was really not appropriate”. He looked surprised, looked at another men, who looked back at him understandingly. The second man drove him out of the facility later, they became friends. "
I was at a construction conference today in Glasgow. During an (all male) panel discussion about some of the issues in the industry the issue of the lack of women working in it came up as something that needs urgently resolved. Great I thought. Then one of the panel comments that women don’t need to work on site because “there’s plenty of back office jobs they can do”. My jaw nearly hit the floor. 
"I’m a licensed massage therapist and have had a practice for nearly a decade and yet I have gotten to the point where if I’m in any social situation if a male asks me what my profession is I lie, because 99% of the time their immediate response is to make a “happy ending” joke or make comments about “how good I am with my hands” and ask if I make “house calls” while leering at me. I’m sorry if you misheard me. I said massage therapist not prostitute. "

"I have become an expert in my field (research). I work with mostly male management. I don’t pretend to know everything, but I’m bright, adaptable and I catch on fast. I often get to the nub of a problem before the rest of the room, only to witness my insight being ignored when I (clearly and unapologetically) voice it. Two minutes later, the exact same point is repeated by a man (some are even gracious enough to name check it as my point), only for the man to be proclaimed as having made a ‘great point’. Sometimes, I run a little experiment. In meetings when male colleagues talk over me, instead of shutting up, I keep talking and count how long they are prepared to acknowledge it it they who were ignorant enough to talk over me and have the courtesy to shut up. I abandoned one experiment after we hit 10 seconds. Try it. 10 seconds is a loooong time.to talk over someone who is still speaking. "
"I am a teacher. When I started, I received a lot of unwanted attention from a male teacher who said he was being “like a dad” watching out for me. He bought me flowers, cornered me in rooms, tried to sit close with me and show me nude pictures of women that he had taken. Nothing like a dad, I think. A colleague started to question his actions, and he backed off a little, but I shared a workplace with him for several years. I never once felt at ease at that school. "
"I am a scientist, and from time to time I post pictures on my social media about what I am currently studying or working on. This week I posted some electrical components and someone, a friend in fact asked me what my boyfriend was building. I responded and said it was mine and I also said that it was sexist for him to say it was my boyfriends. To which he replied that he wasn’t sexist. Then while telling my other male friend about the injustice he also told me it wasn’t sexist and then I came home and told my bf who also explained to me that it wasn’t sexist. "
So I’m digging a hole at the side of the road with my road repair team and it’s roasting hot outside so I work with no shirt on. I have a hi viz on with jeans and a hard hat. As I am am working women see my bulging arms and shoulders and feel the need to pass comment on how good I look. I feel totally objectified. I’m a working class man I do not deserve this kind of sexism from women. 
"I made the mistake of reaching out to two of my gallerists who I was introduced to and were close friends of a curator I was working with intensely with who was driving me nuts with unwanted advances, sexual in nature u-tube videos, weird watercolors of body parts made by him and sent to me, plus constantly telling me he ‘loved me’. At the time my entire income was dependent on him, as well as my connections as he is quite well known. I tried appealing directly to this curator, but his behavior only got worse. Anyway I approached my gallerists because they knew him well, because I thought they could help me achieve distance from him financially and personally, and I thought they could help him as well. I always considered him a sick man and his actions were clearly anti-social, at the time he was going through a third divorce and his ex refused to speak to him permanently. She was also taking him to the cleaners for adultery. He also pretended to be my friend when I was alone and vulnerable, and confided to me he was sexually abused as a child by his brother, which in retrospect was probably done to gain my confidence in this area. (I heard he has told the story to other women, he lies a lot and I have no idea if it is true). At one point he offered to lend me money when I was at a loss, because a sale he was brokering changed abruptly from four works to two. I reluctantly agreed to take the loan, I would never take money from this man unless he promised the sale would go through very soon, and I even gave him a 3000 euro discount because he asked, and he promised it would go through. Anyway two years have passed and I finally confronted him on the phone and he has no intention of following through on his promise. Furthermore he demands I pay him back this large sum of money. He is telling his friends I owe him money. He also told me his friends (my gallerists) told him that I complained to them about sexual harassment, and I’ve realized both of these gallerists have silently blacklisted me, and have not sold a single artwork since that time. I made over 150,000 euros from direct sales through this curator, and sold work through these galleries in the beginning, but now I cannot depend on my gallerists for support and I have no idea who this curator is talking to me about. I have no idea who I can trust and how to get my reputation and career back. "

"Two recent examples of Every Day Sexism: I walk into Next and ask where the suits are (OK, so not everyone has to wear suits to work nowadays, but some of use do) and they direct me to the men’s department! Can understand why the young, female shop assistant is confused as the men’s department has 20 different suits and the women’s only 2. But honestly, do I look like a man? Or is the assumption that I would only be buying a suit for a man? And, Next, please stock more women’s suits – you used to have loads. Secondly, I ring a company about managed ‘executive’ accommodation when working away from home. The guy on the phone says that that they are all men in the building, except one woman, who is the family nanny. When I say I work in IT He says “Do you work on the helpdesk?” “No,” I tell him, “I work as a senior analyst programmer.” OK, so only one out of 10 IT workers are women, and that’s bad enough, but the assumption seems to be that the women who do work in IT must of course work on the Helpdesk. He can stick his executive accommodation. "

"At work, there is a guy with whom I get on well. I mistly have time for him, apart from the fact that he keeps kissing me. Whenever he sees me, he grabs my whole head and kisses me either on my cheek (inching closer to my lips every time) on my hair/forehead. Each time, he holds these kisses a little bit longer. It’s seriously creepy. Creepier still when you consider the fact that he KNOWS well that I’ve a serious boyfriend whom I love very much. Creepier still when you consider that when I’ve backed away and told him to stop, he actually responds by challenging me, as if I’m denying him something to which he is very much entitled. He actually demands to know why I’ve told him to stop. But he is not entitled to kiss me. My boyfriend is irrelevant because I would recoil from this man even if I were single. Relationship or no, I am/would be repulsed and that is enough reason for him to stop. And I will have to tell him that next time he does this, which, OF COURSE, will be the very next time I see him. Because his sense of male entitlemnt is such that doesn’t see anything wrong with being overly affectionate towards female colleagues who clearly do not recipricate. "
"Since I was first educated about feminism in tertiary education I’ve proudly called myself a feminist and been somewhat aware that I exist in a sexist world. Ten years on and when appropriate I’ve tried to inform those who are not educated on what feminism is – what it really means including my boyfriends, friends, and family. Recently, I’ve heard things said about me such as ‘such is a staunch feminist’ and ‘oh sexism really fires her up’ whenever I’ve tried to call out sexism in what I believe has always been a respectful yet assertive manner (usually in the workplace). Two months ago I finished the book Everyday Sexism and I am happy to say this book has changed my life forever for the better. See the thing is, whilst I was experience sexist comments and being challenged on feminism on the regular. I had become more resilient and taken on an attitude that sticks and stones could break my bones but words would never hurt me. But you see, it was these pieces on everyday sexism that I was experience that I could now see is what leads to a culture that enabled abuse and rape as part of my childhood. Rape jokes begun at the age of ten at school which moved onto slut shaming in high school. My experiences, or experiences of those that are close to me have been silenced, or too painful to ever bear thinking about – yet alone talking about. I was never educated about sex or relationships, I was educated not to get pregnant and society enforced to me that it was a giant fuck up if I did. Society told me to give your baby a good life, you must be married and have money. I remember my dad pulling over the car one day to tell me that if I did get pregnant to never get an abortion. I never believed my body was mine. I remember being at a party at 18 and an ex-boyfriend’s father asked me ‘so, are you staying out of trouble and not getting pregnant’ I had actually started my degree that year and at that age was more educated that his son who was 4 years my senior is today but he never thought to ask me about that. I was never taught that if you say ‘no’ and someone pushes themselves on you and you don’t physically push them away because you feel so pressured that if you did or ever spoke of it again (how it really was) you will loose all of your friends, your job, and likely not have the belief of your family – that it is rape. I was never educated about what a good relationship should look like and that I should feel safe and loved. I never knew that if something went wrong there someone to help me other than my mother who had suffered domestic violence herself. I’d heard rumours about a friend who had been raped and then later my friend told me about it. She told me that when she came to after drinking too much she realised her friends dad was raping her. She told her mum, and her mum suggested she not go to the police because of how hard it would be for her. Years later the same person raped me and thanks to Everyday Sexism this has been the first time I’ve ever felt safe enough to talk about it. I’ve witnessed domestic violence first hand and I’ve tried my hardest to erase it from my memory because even today I still do not want to believe my father was capable of doing something so bad. We tell ourselves that if we don’t talk about it, it will go away but what I see today scatter throughout my family and friends are women who are deeply suffering from mental illnesses as consequences, women who have turned to alcohol and drugs to forget and are living lives far from what they had ever dreamt of. I want to do more, I want to see that man who raped me and my friend behind bars. Instead, today I learn he has just had another baby. For now, this is all I can face doing. Thank you for helping me.

"This is about an acquaintance, â€œMiss Aâ€? Miss A, a 32 year-old woman, was employed at a London property company from 2008, initially as a PA and subsequently as an asset manager. By all accounts she performed well in both of these roles, hence her promotion, her being awarded a comfortable discretionary bonus in the final year of her employment, and her employer funding her professional examinations to become a chartered surveyor. Simultaneously, an intimate personal relationship began in 2008 between Miss A and the companyâ€™s chief executive, â€œMister Eâ€?. According to information presented at employment tribunal this was a significant relationship and Mr E indicated that he would leave his wife in order to pursue the relationship. Indeed in a text message to Miss A presented before the judge he said, â€œI just need to get that f**king bitch out of my lifeâ€?. Mr E, described in the hearing as a charismatic character who likes to be central to office life, has what might be described as an idiosyncratic management style. Such charms include proclaiming â€œitâ€™s a tits out day todayâ€? to a crowded office, generously splashing out on sex toys for his female employees and spraying liquid nitrogen up female employees skirts. His recruitment policy was to not hire anyone â€œold, fat or maleâ€?. According to Miss A he also regularly pestered her to persuade an Australian colleague to participate in a threesome in exchange for a pledge to sponsor her visa to work in the UK. In December 2010 events took a turn when an anonymous informant sent a letter to Mr Eâ€™s wife disclosing details of the affair. Life subsequently became very difficult for Mr E whose children were no longer talking to him and whose wife was demanding that he terminate Miss Aâ€™s employment. Which is exactly what he tried to do, offering a Â£50k redundancy package â€“ initially a choice, eventually an ultimatum. However, Miss A was resolute that she would keep her job and continued to work there (and they continued, in Mr Eâ€™s words, to become intimate) until February 2012. The year was interspersed with difficulties with Mr E periodically demanding that she leave, storming into rages, and at one point instructing that the locks on the office doors be changed. Miss A tried to manage this situation, asking for ground rules and raising the situation in her appraisal form (which Mr E then promptly shredded). In February 2012 Miss A was told she was fired, â€œDonâ€™t you f**king come backâ€?. The events that followed can only be described as chaotic. A director of the company told Miss A to take a few days for things to blow over. Two days later she was informed by text message that her resignation (which hitherto had not existed) had been accepted. The only records that the company holds of these exchanges are two pieces of hand written notes, neither of which feature Miss Aâ€™s assertions â€“ in text messages and on a conference call â€“ that she had not resigned. The case was heard in the London Central Employment Tribunal in February 2013. Mr E did not attend to defend his witness statement, citing reasons of illness and stress. In his written witness statement he claims that the personal relationship ended in November 2010 (somewhat undermined by Miss Aâ€™s unchallenged claim that in December 2010 she was taken by taxi to a hotel room in which he was waiting). He alleges that Miss A struggled to deal with the relationshipâ€™s demise and subsequently became controlling and possessive and that the professional relationship had broken down irretrievably. He makes un-evidenced claims that she had threatened to destroy him, his business and his family. Simultaneously, and illogically, he asserts that the company was not trying to push her out â€“ citing the bonus and the funding of professional exams to support this. The company was represented instead by two of its directors. One of these admitted to the judge that he did not record Miss Aâ€™s assertion that she had never resigned on his notes of the conference call because it was â€˜of no consequenceâ€™. The same director was also forced on cross-examination to delete a paragraph of his sworn witness statement because it was factually inaccurate. Both directors felt that they had no place or need to question Mr Eâ€™s office behaviour. The company secured a permanent restriction on open reporting of the case, ensuring that Mr E and his business will eternally escape public scrutiny. Mr E appears to be yet another man, seemingly lacking control over his desires or his actions, reluctant to take responsibility for their consequences. Despite his continuing to sleep with her, he sees Miss A as the vixen â€“ who took what she wanted from him and then turned nasty when things didnâ€™t go her way. Rather, she was his commodity who once he had no purpose for could be discarded and disposed of without accountability. Her determination to assert her legal rights is interpreted as a vicious threat to his way of life. Even the companyâ€™s only female director told the judge that she found it â€˜audaciousâ€™ that Miss A should ask to not be harassed at work. As is so often the case, it is the woman employee who is expected to grin and bear it, pack up and move on leaving the male employer free to repeat the whole saga again. Despite taking every step possible to damage Miss Aâ€™s reputation (including wild accusations of threatening behaviour) Mr E has thrown all available resources at his quest to protect his reputation. He could not even show Miss A or the tribunal the respect of attending the hearing and fronting up to the claims against him and his company. Miss A won her claim of unfair dismissal and sexual harassment through the shredding of the appraisal. The judge branded Mr Eâ€™s behaviour â€œfoul and objectionableâ€?, adding that it had no place in the office in the 21st century. The claim for sex discrimination was not successful. The judge deemed that the reason for the dismissal was the breakdown of the relationship, not Miss Aâ€™s sex. The right-wing press coverage has been true to type. Miss A is reported as â€˜the PAâ€™ despite having worked for the previous two years as an asset manager. Her promotion is suggested to be a function of the affair rather than the possibility that she had actually performed well at work and taken on more responsibility. The reader is led to the conclusion that though Mr E is an unsavoury character, Miss A was already getting more than she deserved and is now coming back for more. ‘Sacked by my lover boss who asked me to fix up a threesome’ Daily Telegraph http://tinyurl.com/cljptls Boss ‘had three year affair with his PA… and sacked her when his wife found out’ Daily Mail http://tinyurl.com/cj24c82 Boss ‘fired PA after wife told of affair’ Metro http://tinyurl.com/d93bdwa â€˜Chief executive unfairly dismissed assistant after exposure of their affairâ€™ Daily Telegraph http://tinyurl.com/lfcm3f8 â€˜PA sacked after affair with boss set for payoutâ€™ Evening Standard http://tinyurl.com/ltb3l29 â€˜Ex-mistress sacked as property tycoon’s PA after wife discovered affair in line for big payoutâ€™ Daily Mail http://tinyurl.com/l26agzn The focus on the salacious at the expense of the salient misses the point â€“ the deep, dirty and indelible stains of sexism that continue to taint the workplace in the 21st century.

"So many stories and experiences, I don’t know where to start. Work in an office of 30 men and 3 women. Have to listen to *daily* (I kid you not) discussions about how women are not built for the workplace because they are too emotional, and that they’re better off in the kitchen or in the sack! Never mind that all 3 women are senior in this organization. As I stood in front of a restaurant last week hailing a cab, the valet guy repeatedly complimented me, stared at my chest, looked me up and down like a piece of meat, and then had the audacity to stroke my arm several times- all while I ignored him and kept moving away, desperately waiving at cabs to stop. I was quite shaken up by the unexpected physical contact so I told my male best friend as soon as I returned to work, and he replied, “Well, men hit on girls (I’m 30 and not a girl!), it’s what they do.” When I explained that this valet didn’t have the right to touch me in any way without my permission, my friend replied, “Guys can’t help themselves. Stop making a fuss over nothing.” Aged 12, delivery men drop off some furniture at our house. As one delivery man talks to my parents about payment, the other corners me in the other room and places his hands on my (barely developed) chest. He rests it there and smiles the ugliest, creepiest smile I’ve ever witnessed. I was so shocked, confused and ashamed that I never told anyone lest I be blamed. Aged 14, my 17 year old friend takes me to meet her new boyfriend. Her boyfriend has his mates over at his flat. While my friend and her guy go into another room to snog in private, his mates corner me and make all kinds of rude suggestions as to what we can do to pass the time. I noticed one of them locking the apartment door while the others circled me, and I freaked the fuck out. In response to my shouting, they laughed and said “You’re so ugly,you should say yes to the only chance you’ll ever have to get laid.” My continued screaming resulted in them letting me out of the flat before their neighbours came to my rescue, but I lost my friend that day because she said I overreacted and embarrassed her! At the time, I felt like an absolute fool for panicking, but in hindsight, I’m so glad I did because that was most certainly a gang-rape barely avoided. "
"At my workplace, we recently had a meeting, which included lunch and tasting of the new products we were developing. Towards the end of the lunch I was chatting with my coworker, a girl, and my boss, who was about to say something, calls for everyone’s attention, and tells to us “hey girls, stop talking about shoes!”. Because that’s the only thing we could have been talking about of course. Also, I often noticed that when I come into work and go say hi to my boss in his office, when he says hi, I can see his eyes go up and down, checking out what I’m wearing. Maybe he does not do that on purpose, but it makes me really uncomfortable, as he’s old enough to be my dad. "

But it is made worse when I have people at work making comments such as ‘what tits’ while leering over others much larger, much more curvaceous body shapes ?. When did my beauty and worth become defined by the size of my boobs? It makes me sad to think that so many people judge me by my body, and not my mind.

A man I’ve been dealing with (a few e-mails, one phone call) meets us in the car park – we all shake hands, but when it comes to my turn he leans in to kiss me on the cheek. I don’t reciprocate – if anything, I move away (not easy, as he’s still shaking my hand). Instead of taking the hint, he leans across to kiss the other cheek!! I hear him mutter something about me ‘not liking’ being kissed on the cheek. No, person I hardly know – I didn’t like you making assumptions about what level of physical contact was appropriate.

"This is a fantastic idea. I’ve always considered myself a feminist and often thought that society had made enough steps forward that equality of opportunity was now a reality. After all I was brought up with a female prime minister, where women voted, equal pay is law and dignity at work is legislated for. I was wrong. On reflection her story is still one that relies on dependence where his story in not. I began to realise this when pregnant, becoming a mother and later becoming a single mother. It was not because doors were shut. Quite the contrary. My employers were very careful to be pc. I had a flexible working agreement agreed. On flexible working. Well this also applies to men. But I consider it from a feminist perspective because it effects more women. Now my employers were very helpful with my flexible working agreement. I’m very thankful for it. This is perhaps the key. The employer feeling like they are doing the employee a favour and the employee feeling grateful is a blocker to progression. After all we know from statistical analysis that an employer gets more commitment, and productivity from the part time workers than there full time workers. Yet business continues to advertise predominantly if not exclusively full time roles… how many company’s will consider advertising a job sharing position let alone at director level! Then there is gender pay gap. Something for life of me I don’t get. It’s clearly a problem for professional and skilled works as minimum wage is set. So why would a male graduate given themail same opportunities and performance ratings as a female graduate end up earning more in the first year of employment. I’m not even sure. Something that would be really interesting to research. Is it blatant sexism? Is it institutional sexism? Or is there something else? There are now more women in the work place, more female managers and directors. Yet hand on heart I can think of 3 women I consider mentors in the work environment. A lot more male mentors. Both are necessary. How do women learn to be successful women in business when there are few mentors for them to learn from, respect, and emanate. Then there are the legalities involved in who pays for what with children. Both parents are responsible for there children. Responsible for caring and providing for them. Yet increasingly an increase in family breakdown the mother (most of the time) becomes the parent responsible for both. Yes child maintenance exists (for parents that haven’t managed to avoid it) but it doesn’t go far enough. Here’s why. It does not factor in the cost of child care when both parents work. For example child maintenance will rarely cover half of a full time child care bill let alone put anything towards food or cloths. On child maintenance it had recently introduced a charge to ask them to calculate maintenance due. This fee is not even shared between parents. It charged to the parent requesting a calculation. Usually the caring parent, prominently the mother. On childcare and this applies to all families. The role of career of children within a family is given zero monetary value. It’s cultural sexism as it is predominantly women who choose to do this. Yet I can self sacrifice salary without tax to pay a child minder but cannot do this to pay a family member in mother, father, grand parent to fulfill this role. The caring parent then has to pay the bills. There right to work becomes difficult as they are responsible for child care. There right to be a full time parent becomes difficult as they are required to provide. There right to hold property becomes difficult as there ability to work means they can no longer pay the mortgage. Tax This area I think is institutional sexism. Council tax. Calculated on band. So dependent on the size of your property. Fair enough that is the system. But the family with 1 parent can claim a reduction of 1/4. This is generally the woman. She cannot take in a lodger as she has the child to consider. Yet the family with 2 salaries technically pays less council tax that the family with 1 salary. The family with two incomes can collectively earn more before tax than the family with one income. What are we saying here? Do we really think there are less costs on bring up a one parent family than a two parent family! Really! It is discrimination. The family ticket offers a reduction to the two parent family and not to the 1 parent family. Holidays are more expensive. Then there is the legal side. Why do women get harsher sentences for the same crime as a man. Why is it OK in a rape case to not bring to court past convictions of a male defendant of rape but not extend this to the victim whose character can be annaysied in detail in the court. Why do we talk about the clothing or the sexiest life of a victim of rape? Why is it even relevant? So this has turned into a bit of a rant. I think what I am saying is that every day sexism is now so subtle in the roles we have assigned to genders and accepted. How do we start a conversation about this? Not a culture of necessary dependency on men, state and family. But engaging and facilitating a real shift and development in the enabling of women in the place they are in. Be that in the work place or the home. "
"Something that pissed me off a lot today. I’m at this big company event in Bulgaria, 600 people, management team presenting their achievements and plans for the next year. All goes well till the HR Manager steps to the stage. She starts to describe what was done using the example of four employees, 3 men and 1 woman. And about the man it’s all about achievements, business goals, business activities. When she gets to the women she describes her as a employee “strugling with setting work-life ballance as a mother of 3”. That’s it. Nothing more about her goals or achievements. And it goes downhill from there. When further talking about thes example employees she speaks about guys doing this and that project, participating in sessions, coaching, all the different BUSINESS development elements. But when she goes to the woman she speaks again about the time management and priorities and making sure employees will have an enviroment to grow, a safe place, cause “in the end 40% of our female staff is on maternity now”. Again, nothing about their business goals and nothing about families of those three guys. And I nearly flipped and left when at some point she said, on the stage, in front of 600 young people, where 1/4 of them for sure were women that “I tell you ladies, don’t get married so young”. Comon! really?! I’m just so ashamed this is a woman saying this and sends the message that all these women has to worry about at work is how to balance it with families that it would be better they didn’t have. "

"This has not happened to me, but to women I work with. The manager of my workplace (a cafe) has had a history of propositioning the attractive girls who work with him. He first did this to a 15 year old, which was reported but nothing was done about it (he is 38). I didn’t work work there at the time, so I only heard this from the girl, now 16. However, I was approached by a 19 who I also work with (I am 17 by the way) who told me that he had asked her to go with him to “fool around in the store room”. I told her to report it to our boss but she replied that it was normal and it was harmless. This continued for three months, with texting and propositioning to go with him into the store room. I have tried and tried again to get her to report it to the boss, and even tried myself, but to no avail. Nothing is being done because the 19 year old says “she likes it”, but it is clear that she doesn’t. I tell her that it is harassment, but she always denies it. No one believes me that this is happening because the girl is not saying anything and he is denying it. I don’t want to stop working there because I need the money, but it makes me sick to think that this is constantly happening. "

"During a catch up with my manager where I told him I was feeling frustrated after coming back after maternity leave, he listened to my concerns (without saying a word) and then sat in silence before saying ‘well I don’t want this to be woman dumps problems and man provides solutions’. He then said that another male member of the team had been fine after his baby was born (he had 3 weeks paternity leave and I had a year). He then told his boss that I had issues. Before I had a baby I was one of the top performers singled out for top management. Now I am sidelined and treated like an idiot. 90% of people at the top where I work are men and I now know why. Sad as before I had children I really believed things were changing for women moving up. I’m sure it isn’t like this everywhere but it shouldn’t be like this anywhere. "

"Our Director is a sports nerd and loves to participate in Mud Days. Mots of the employees are female. So the Director invited a few colleagues to participate in a Mud Day with him. 4 agreed, 3 of them female. Pictures of the event were later published on a few personal facebook accounts. The next morning the rumour mill was spinning away : who had the Director slept with, among the 3 female employees to go the event with him. Eventhough everyone is married, that there has never been any suspicion of such behaviour going on. And the ones spreading the rumours were females. It adresses many problems : 1/ I feel that females are encouraged to compete constantly against each other instead of showing support or solidarity. There is no other of dealing with another female achieving something I cannot (as a female) : hate her. Do not try to understand where you went wrong, or try to tell her well done, or try to ask here how she did it, or admit that you are just not meant to achieve this particular goal. No. Hate her. 2/ The ones spreading the rumors were applying the age-old formula : associate female employee + male superior + sex in order to deal witht heir frustration. Even if the ones spreading the rumors were close friends with the ones that had done the mud day and knew that nothing was happening. "
"Our top boss, in a directors meeting were many females were present (including me). Top Boss explains why he will be trying to hire males only from now on. Than he looks at the female directors present and goes “Sorry ladies, but you know how it is, with the kids and everything”. They all smiled. They all have children 16 and above. I was appalled, of course, but said nothing. I was afraid for my job. And I wondered if they kept silent because they were in a position of power and had dealt with *ssh*les like Top Boss all their lives or if the were scared for their jobs just like me. And the entitlement. Top Boss felt secure enough in his position to say something like that and he knew we were going to keep our mouths shut. The humiliation. I felt like a piece of garbage after that meeting. Both because he made me feel like one (I am meant to reproduce and when I do – not even “if”- I will be branded by society to make that child my sole focus. My partner? Bleh) and because of my attitude. "
"In a meeting where we discuss the new positions we will need to hire in order to complete a project. One of the people present, a female Director, feels the need to add “And we won’t hire girls in their 30s, because we need them full time. No babies”. Thank you, fellow ovarian bearer. We needed that. OH and this project we’re working on? Implementing the computer system in public centers in charge of providing health care to EXPECTANT MOTHERS and FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. And the woman who made this comment has worked in this sector for more than 15 years. Yay. I think I’m going to call it the “Virgin Mary Phenomenon”. When a child is born, society is ok with thinking that you, the mother, as the person who gave birth to them, are completely alone in this world to take care of them. You reproduced by yourself, like a snail or some kind of deity (your pick). You have no partner, no money, no family, no friends and no plans. You obviously never planned for a baby, never asked how other families got organized, never discussed how it will impact your professional life as well as your partners, never put money aside to cover expenses no. It is ok for your partner to not take part in any aspect of the child’s life. It is accepted that your male partner will never know how to make them a meal or change a diaper. They can drive, vote or use a computer, but will never learn to heat up food. Oh and before you ask, being in a homosexual relationship with a child is not something that apparently does exist (??!??). Sorry. Got a bit carried away, but arrrrgggghh. "
"Being asked to work on a new project with a male lead, I asked him for a meeting in order to gather information about the project. He tells me a few things when I ask specific questions but nothing very important. 2 days later he has a meeting with my boyfriend who works in the same company. The male lead spills the beans about every detail of the project, the strategy, the political decisions behing the planning of the project, who is what, what he wants to do, everything. Most of the questions my boyfriend asked were the same I had asked previously. My boyfriend then gave me all the answers the male lead hadn’t given me. It is going to be a fun collaboration. "

"I work as a host on canal boats in my city. Sometimes we hire people from outside the company to help out or be a cook. Yesterday there was a cook I hadn’t seen before but I started working right away so when I spotted him my hands were full and I told him I’d be right back to properly introduce myself. Our interaction started of by him saying ‘A wink would be fine too’, following his words with a wink. This made me feel awkward, but I thought I’d let it pass because I had things to do and it was just like ‘oh okay’. Later on I was leaning out a window for a few minutes and when I ducked back to get back in, he was behind me suddenly. So I bumped by behind right into him. I said ‘Oh I’m sorry’ and he just went ‘Yeah, you kinda have to look out with a big butt like that’. At that point our guests were on board and I couldn’t start a scene but I did mention it to the guide and the captain who said that if he kept going, they’d make a point out of it. Anyway, the tour went on, everything was fine, I went upstairs to wash some of the last things and when I came back our guide told me she spent 5 minutes with him alone and he pretended to trip and fall so he could grab on to her. I mean???? So we both send an email and he won’t be hired again. TL;DR I got someone on the black list within 24 hours of harassing 2 of the crewmembers I wasn’t down for that "

"I did a film degree where the majority of the class were men. Every year you had to pitch your idea to the class for a film to be made – mine were always ideas with a strong female identity and protagonist. I never got my ideas picked and subsequently, because of the structure of the course, was never given the opportunity to direct a film in university. I didn’t give up and the pitch I put forward for the final graduation film was about the everyday sexism that women face. I get quite nervous talking in front of large groups of people and when my two female course leaders (both of whom had proclaimed themselves as feminists) started to ask questions about my idea they just completely tore me apart in front of the whole class. They then told me after that my idea was completely unrealistic?! Out of the 12 films that were made, just one of the directors was female. I graduated as a production designer and my degree has absolutely no use in my working life whatsoever now. I’ve learned to be disappointed by men’s attitudes towards women in the workplace and when they are confronted by feminist ideas but to get that from a fellow woman is so disheartening. "
Blatant sexism on facebook page of big business here WW always have near naked woman on each stores facebook page 
"Working in an office, in a team of male colleagues who constantly talk about topics which are generally male orientated, but also often offensive. Left with the following options to: a) not engage in conversation ad stay quite for the vast majority of the day… b) express an opinion or try to join in when you feel/know it’s not wanted (c) not have options a or b, having been left awkwardly out of group emails regarding said topic… This would be easier to just get on with if I didn’t make an effort, have good conversations and get along with each of them on their own or in smaller groups, however collectively and for most of the time, left feeling a bit isolated. Lunch outings and after work drinks arranged without extending an invite – even if it’s just a formality it’s always nice to be asked instead of worrying what’s wrong with you! This probably happens to minority males too and just people in general – I guess sometimes group dynamics, interests and personalities are different… "
"My friend is a recently qualified massage theapist and I hadnt seen her in a long time until this weekend. She kindly assessed my posture for me as I’m aware that it’s pretty awful, she explained in detail the effects my bad posture has on me and we talked about how this posture can be adopted because of psychological factors – stress, shyness, underconfidence. It got me thinking and being a large breasted woman, who from the moment pubity hit got a lot of attention because of this I think it has a negative effect on my confidence and so feel I must not stand up right as when I do this is feels as though I’m pushing my breasts out and therefore attracting unwanted attention which fills me with anxiety. I’m becoming more and more aware of these deep rooted areas of sexism in our society which are complex and complicated. It’s hard to explain to anyone who doesn’t have large breasts and is too underconfident or hates getting attention because of this. I love my breasts and im lucky that they are nice but they are for me and my partner. Not for ogling men which makes my stomach turn. It’s confusing to me. "
"Sometimes my workplace requires me to turn up for work quite late in the evenings. I don’t have a car so I usually walk the short mile-ish journey to get there, and when I arrive I immediately wash my hands. Today a colleague commented on this, asking why I do this. I explained that I hold my keys between my knuckles when walking alone and I don’t like the metallic feeling/smell they leave on my hands. My (male) colleague was horrified that I felt the need to do this; further discussion with other colleagues led to several other women admitting they do similar things. One even kept a small aerosol deodorant in her handbag purely for protection. "

I’m a community health worker. i’m not a nurse but my uniform makes me look like one. In the course of my duties I was in my car at a red traffic light when a car pulled up next to me. I heard a man calling “Nurse!” He then went on to ask if I could help with some sexual favour. I decided to ignore him & his giggling male friends. I had time before the lights changed to think up some witty retort but didn’t dare say anything because I was in uniform. I’ve joked about the incident with colleagues but actually it’s not OK. It’s not ok that blokes can be sexually suggestive but I can’t speak up because I have to be professional. I can’t even report it because I have to put the name of the perpetrator on my organisation’s incident form. And what exactly would they be able to do about it anyway? The same week my 15 year old daughter was waiting for a bus & was asked by two teenage boys for her number and if they could contact her via social media. When she refused they accused her of being racist because they weren’t white. She said she really wanted to give them a lecture on feminism but thought it would make it worse.

What strikes you about all of these venues? Aren’t they a bit, well, blokeish? Yes, I know there are women interested in all of these things (I like a nice car myself) – but after a while you see a trend developing, and you begin to wonder if they really want the women to come along at all.

"In my first week of my job, a colleague approached me outside of work. He is an older man (40-mid 40 years old) and I am in my 20’s, petite, mousy and quiet and I look much younger. At first, I thought he was making polite conversation. I would wait outside my workplace at 10pm for the bus and he would consistently approach me, but because we are colleagues I didn’t feel that I could ignore him. Eventually, I decided to walk home on bright summer nights. ‘Coincidentally’ I would bump into him there too and he started to show up half an hour before his shift was due to begin. I began wearing headphones to signal I didn’t want to talk, but that did not deter him. So I crossed to the other side of the busy motorway to avoid him. He followed me over and asked why I had changed sides. One night, he made some odd remarks about missing me whilst I had been on holiday. Two nights later, he ran across the motorway after me shouting my name (I don’t know how he knew my name, I have never introduced myself). Shaken, I discussed it with my other (female) colleagues in confidence and they encouraged me to report it. After being ‘spoken to’ by the workplace, his only explanation was that I had ‘given him the impression that he was my friend’ so he felt he could say those things. I felt ashamed and guilty and that I had somehow brought his behaviour upon myself by trying to be friendly to a colleague. I am the 6th girl to report this particular colleague for harassment in the time I have worked there (almost 2 years). He has worked for the company for 10+ years and still works for there today. I still get scared knowing I could see him at night. Thank you Laura for creating this project and making me feel less alone. I can name 3 more situations similar to this that have happened within the past year alone and for so long I have blamed myself for looking young and impressionable, now I know it’s not the truth. Thank you, thank you. "
"I work at a farmerâ€™s market. As a representative of the farmerâ€™s market I have always felt it is part of my job to be courteous to both the guests and the vendors. Familiarity with the people at the market is part of what makes it fun and relaxed and easier to work alongside people. However, sometimes lines are crossed and the familiar and casual becomes the inappropriate and unacceptable. For a long time my love for the place, the people, and the products had outweighed any factors that made me uncomfortable, and so for years I have overlooked and have pent up feelings and reactions to instances of everyday sexism. It all sort of got to me one night after work. My day had been really exhausting, and I realized that part of what exhausted me so much were all the pretenses I had to keep up all day just to get along with and/or to avoid certain people who make me feel uncomfortable at work. Then I thought about all of the other unwanted little flirtations, comments, jokes, touches, and stares I had put up with and shrugged off in all the time before. I realized that I was being disrespected as a person and as an employee every time one of those little things happens. For example: -When I change a trash bag, I think twice about which way I bend over and who my backside might be pointed towards -When I need to stretch my arms over my head, I try to be out of other peopleâ€™s sight so there is no one to leer at or comment on my breasts or figure – When I smile at a joke, I donâ€™t want to smile too much for fear that someone will take it the wrong way -I feel obligated to take the hugs and compliments of a certain vendor because he is a long time vendor and an elderly man; however it makes me uncomfortable, and once he even said to me how beautiful I was, followed with â€œIf I was a younger manâ€¦â€? This continues every week. -One vendor solicited me for a date, tried to discreetly give me his personal phone number on the back of a business card, subsequently added me on a social media site, and then repeatedly asked when I was going to accept his request when I saw him on following work weeks. Not taking the hint that I wasnâ€™t interested the first couple times. It felt very aggressive and I didnâ€™t know how to respond, so I just started to ignore him and hoped the problem would go away. -Another vendor and their employees routinely and loudly make sexual jokes with their customers as part of their sales technique. I have never heard anyone stand up to them to say that they are offended. I guess it is all supposed to be taken in good fun, but I think it encourages an inappropriate atmosphere. All of the little things (and not so little things) do add up overtime. To a point where I sometimes feel uncomfortable in my workplace, and I feel stuck and unsure if there is anything I can do about it. I am not in an authority position. I suppose I could just leave, but that wouldnâ€™t fix anything. If I speak up against any of them, I risk falling from good standing with those who may think I am just overreacting or being uptight. Having a bad rapport with certain vendors would make it much less pleasant to go to work. I am still not sure what I am going to do about it, but I am glad that I am finally aware of it. Now that Iâ€™ve recognized how pervasive it seems to be, I want to watch out for when it happens and next time try to speak up. Yet, I feel like I need a specific concrete incident in order to really do anything about it. "
"This is the first time I’ve posted on this forum, and I wasn’t sure which story I should include. But, seeing as already today, before 9am, horns were tooted at me and I was ogled at on the tube, 4 times, I feel it appropriate to share this. It’s the last day of August. I live and work in London. I have a 45 minute commute on the tube and it gets very hot and very uncomfortable quickly. So, naturally, one would prepare to wear clothing to keep cool, without getting to work looking like a frizzy-haired, sweaty bear who’s just failed at running a marathon. So, today I have on a dress. Not my normal every-day wear, but seeing as it’s summer and beautiful weather, why not. It’s sleeveless, red and black, has a bateau neckline (no I didn’t just Google that) and sits just slightly above my knees. God Forbid. Cramming onto a tube in rush hour is bad at the best of times, but when it’s sunny and warm outside, so many people are in the worst moods ever. Me included: it’s early, I’ve not had my coffee fix, and I’m crushed into a little tin can that’s hurtling below London’s hot and busy streets. So sure, if you bump into me, I’ll more often than not give a wry smile and a nod of the head – it’s ok. But not this morning. I managed to get a seat about halfway through my journey, once I’d changed from the Northern Line to Piccadilly. And immediately a man who had been sat across from me came and sat right beside me. A little weird, sure, but hopefully harmless. It was as his man-spreading increased and his leg was pressed against mine that I wanted nothing more than to actually get to work and type up my Finance meeting notes. When I jumped off the tube and walked out the station, a builder standing smoking immediately wolf-whistled. On my 5 minute walk to work, 2 white vans honked their horns and the men inside laughing who legit looked about 14 drove away on their merry way, leaving me to feel conscious and walk that little bit quicker and warier of any men around me. All for wearing a dress. The most frustrating thing about this is that I feel there is no way to change this behaviour, because it’s all just a joke and lads are being complimentary, innit. Don’t get so worked up about men paying you attention. Well the thing is, I don’t WANT or NEED this attention. I was on my way to work, as I do every day, and I expect to feel safe and normal like any other person. How can this actually change and what needs to happen before men stop. Just stop. "
"I work at a fast food chain, and a large proportion of my time at work relies on me working at a drivethru window. I’m finding that every single shift I work at that window I get many comments that, my 16 year old self feels greatly uncomfortable hearing from 40 year old men. It can be anything from a subtle “You have a sexy smile Darling” to “Why don’t I take you home with me little one.” No matter what it is, I do not appreciate how they make me feel as if my worth is only dependent on how ‘chirpy’ I am, or ‘how great my ass looks from behind”. When I share any of these stories with friends that happen to be male they dismiss it with false pity and a “I’m sure they are only joking Hun, boys will be boys.” And when I share these stories with my female colleagues what I get are returned stories of a similar fashion as it has happened to them also.

"I have worked in IT for the past 18 years. I have an MSc in design and interactive multimedia. This week I was attending a training session on Google Analytics, organised by the place I’m currently working on a contract at. The male training consultant got to the part about being able to use regular expressions within GA. Some of the, all male, in-house analytics team were present. The training consultant laughed and said directly to them “shall I skip this part, it seems most people here won’t be familiar with this?” The Analytics team bod said “no, please, I’d like people to share my pain!” So the training consultant proceeded, without checking if he needed to, to give us a very lightweight overview of regular expressions. I had been asking a lot of questions and interacting a lot, which had led to him asking me directly “does that make sense?” after each part of his overview. He continued this after every statement that he made when explaining regular expressions. By the end of this I was looking annoyed enough for him to ask, in a throwaway tone “have you encountered these before?”. When I said “yes” (in a rather dry and unimpressed tone) he replied with extreme surprise “oh! you have!” I said “yes” again. He asked “what context was that in, like programming?” “Yes” I said. From then on he directed his “does that make sense?” after each topic, to the whole room. He was not an older male, I’d estimate that he was in his 30s. "
I am a supervisor in a male-dominated field. On a regular basis people come into our office with questions concerning our operations and ask to speak to the person in charge. I ask if there is anything I can help them with so we don’t overload the “top boss” and they reluctantly tell me their question. 9/10 times I can help them with their problem and 9/10 times they look surprised that I know what I’m talking about. I’m tired of everyone assuming that I don’t know anything because I’m the only girl in the workplace. 
"At a pricing discussion at work: Colleague 1: Let’s charge x amount per year. Me: Why are we stuck in the thinking that clients will want a yearly model? Colleague 2: Well, that’s the model we’re using in another office. Why change it? Me: Because clients in this location have different needs, we need to accommodate for that. Colleague 3 (boss): Hang on, let’s discuss this another time. However, I do completely agree with Colleague 2 – we don’t need to be stuck in the thinking that our clients will want a yearly model, and we need to recognize that clients in this location want different things. Me: … I said that… Colleague 3: Well, I said it to colleague 2 a week ago in an email. In essence, my boss heard me having exactly the same through process that she had (without me being told about it), heard me express that thought to my colleague (who had already explicitly been told that thought process), and instead of being surprised that my (male) colleague hadn’t taken it on board and impressed that I’d got there by myself, she attributed my words (which she herself agreed with) to my male colleague, when he had in fact been saying the exact opposite. Excellent. "
"As part of my appraisal I asked to do a management and leadership course that takes six months, my male manager told me he was surprised I wanted to do it and wanted to be sure I wanted to commit to a six month course with assignments as I would be a newly wed (my wedding was due to take place one month into the course). Obviously as a “newly wed” my sole concern should be taking care of my husband! Two years later the same manager declared that if any international meetings came up he would be the one to attend – despite the fact that I am the only one who deals with the international accounts – because I have a baby at home. I pointed out that my daughter has another parent who is perfectly able to look after her without me. "
The other day at a talk about leadership: Someone in the audience “- Why do you think there are so few female CEOs?” The guest speaker (male) “- Women are too brilliant to bother with the hassle of being a CEO” (implying that they don’t want to bother with the politics that goes with the job) and of course to justify his point he added “that’s what the women I met in the past told me…” I am just amazed that a renowned leadership speaker can really believe that and also completely ignore the real reasons why so few women are in leadership positions.

"At 14 my clarinet teacher wanted to show me his new studio upstairs above the room I used to have my lessons in. I had had lessons with him since I was 8 so trusted him. Turns out the room upstairs was a dump. While I was looking out the window he came up behind me and put his arms around me tightly pushing on my boobs with his body close up against me. I had big boobs from 14 onwards and always experienced a lot of cat calling and even jokes from friends would get to me. Boys would often grab my boobs or ask if they could feel/see them and I was always known as Emma big tits. I felt like a sexual freak show. It was horrific. I had a breast reduction at 20 after feeling psychologically, I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. Boys and even fully grown men would shout and stare at me even when I was wearing my school uniform. Even following breast reduction I suffered sexual harassment in the workplace from a man old enough to be my Dad. I wore the same as everyone else – a uniform of loose fitting t-shirt and black trousers. I went through a sexual harassment complaint and it turned out he had done the same to a girl before me but she never went through with a full complaint. Going through the grievance, the guy in question referred to his constant innuendos and grabbing my bum as ‘banter’ and just a joke. I also had a man sat opposite me start touching himself under the table on a train home from London like it was completely normal. Well done for this great work that you are doing and the awareness you are raising. And thank you. Sharing the story helps to exorcise some demons. "
"I needed help connecting to the printer at my workplace, and the techie said to me “I need some motivation to do this – show me your best sex face”. Another time after I answered a customer service call, the same techie commented “Damn your voice would be great for phone sex. Call me.” and grabbed his crotch. When he bothered me on Facebook and I told him to stop, he said “If I want you, I’ll get you, and I’ll have you alive as and when I want, whether you like it or not. I’mma fuck you till you can’t walk. Haha” When I told the boss, he told me to stop taking things so seriously, it was just a joke. "
I was taking a motorized cart back into the store where I work and a random man felt the need to come up to me and say I “failed my parking test.” 
"Years ago now, but I went to pay the rent on the shop I ran in Kensington and the landlord bent down and bit my breast. I got my then fiance to ring him and he begged him not to tell his boss. I felt unprotected and vulnerable. Now my daughter in her 20s is still suffering from harassment at work. It has to stop. I used to wear heels when travelling on the tube just so I could grind my heel into the foot of a man rubbing his erection into me. It has to stop. I had a very young au pair who would walk the long way round to get to our house to avoid a building site. It has to stop. I once had my bum pinched whilst working at a staff agency in Soho (also years ago). I yelled ‘get your filthy hands off me!. He turned round and started throwing heavy rubbish from the pavement at me. I ran into the deli and the boys in there chased him into a shop. He then turned on them. I rang the police. One of them said if it had happened to his wife she would be crying so why wasn’t I? The police did nothing. It has to stop. There is a freedom I have now I am over 60. It has stopped for me, but not for the women who come behind. "
"I worked at a special workplace training center for the disabled as part of my Vocational Rehabilitation program, one of the men there would consistently stare at my chest and comment on the color of my shirt just to make sure I knew what he was looking at. When I tried to explain it to my supervisor in private, I was told that since it was an environment for special needs individuals that nothing would be done and that I should not say anything further. When I brought it up again, I was fired and removed from Vocational Rehab. "
"The whole company received an email last week reminding everyone that our once-monthly dress down day was coming up. It said “It’s that time of the month again, hopefully a lot less messy than that other time of the month”. This was from the payroll manager, who comes under the umbrella of HR "
"I was the only woman present in a manager training class that lasted 3 days. I work for a GIANT solar install/construction company who LOVES to tout their “culture”. Unfortunately, they were unaccustomed to having women attend the training – probably because they promote women so infrequently – so my presence thoroughly shook the events. After the second day of training the group went to dinner. After dinner one of the higher-ups in the company had a couple of beers and then told me that he’d like to make out with me, and asked if he could kiss my tattoos. I was polite (on account of liking my job and not wanting to lose it), so I politely declined and excused myself to my room. The 3rd and final day of training was very uncomfortable for me with him in the room. A few of the men in the room were struggling with hangovers, but my struggle was tied to being the only woman in the training. Not only does this man still have his job, but his face is constantly plastered over company flyers, holding him up as the example of what an ideal employee looks like. Makes me sick every time. "
"I was walking out to my car after working the night shift and a car full of high school aged boys drove past. One of them leaned out his window and yelled “How do you like pizza bitch!” and threw a piece of pepperoni pizza at me, hitting me on my back. "
"I’m an eighteen year old girl. Working a regular 40 hours per week, I support myself and I’m currently saving for a college education. My boss of thirty six years old had picked me up me one night after a social gathering. He took me back to his place and offered me a drink. I took it thinking that maybe I needed it to stomach what was probably going to happen next. We slept together. Not just that night but days, weeks and months after. I was reminded that I was to keep quiet about it because he would lose his job if anyone at the store had figured out about it. He manipulated me into believing that I should trust him and he played me for months, giving me the impression that we were somehow going to end up together if I quit my job at the store. Although within the time we were seeing each other he slept with another woman employee at the store and lied about it to me. I chose to forget about it and move on, although it hurt me. We spent lots of time together, talking and just sitting with each other. We had disagreements and we fought about some things but in the end he was always worth it, to stay. I was in love with him. He was everything to me. I wanted to make him happy, and constantly did things to make him happy. For instance, I would always make his bed in the morning, do his dishes, take his garbage/recycling out, clean his house, fold his laundry, plan events for us to go to, drive him places… literally everything and anything I could do. We decided to move in together eight months down the road, but just as friends. I arranged for viewings and worked around his schedule. Time and time again I did things for him. At work his gradually starter to become mean and unfair to me but I thought I’d let it slide until he swore at me. But that’s another story. Once we had finally looked at the last place (#16) we decided to take it. I arranged for us to sign the lease together and to give our landlord a damage deposit. He never showed up to signing the lease blaming it on work and never payed the damage deposit claiming it was against the law. He never contacted our landlord and our new landlord had to contact me to get a hold of my boss. My boss was on a trip that he claimed gave him no cell service so he didn’t respond to any of my texts/calls. Frustrated and angry, I kept trying to get a hold of him hoping that he would call me back. He had called me a few bad things and when he got back into town he and I talked. This is where he called me selfish, childish, simple minded, erratic, emotionally unstable, and uneducated. He told me the problem spurred simply because of my gender. My gender is the problem. That the reason he is unmarried and had no kids is because of women like me. He told me that because I was a woman I could never understand him. He told me that men run the world because they are superior to women. He said most women get attached to any guy who pays attention to them, especially if they have money. Which is just ridiculous. He also said that he would want to date a self sufficient, conservative, farmer woman because they looked up to their male mate as a superior and that’s the way things should be. I was outraged. Out of everything I have done for this man, out of how much I’ve cared, out of how much I’ve loved… just so disrespectful and unacceptable. I know that one day, he’ll learn that he just had hurt my feelings. "
"I worked for a contractor and was told each day that I would be ‘f*ckin great for breeding off’ by the site manager called Brian. One day he asked for some paperwork. I went in his office and he was sat behind his desk. As I approached he grabbed me by the back of the neck and pushed my head to his crotch. I managed to break free and ran out of the office. He ran after me and kicked me really hard up the backside with his steel work boots on. Looking back I should have called the Police. I reported in to Regional Director. I was sacked a week later. I been success in applying for an internal position in the group. I decided to just forget about it. The Regional Director called the new office were I would be working to tell them to steer clear of me and I was trouble etc. Brian had admitted everything and apologised in a meeting with myself and the Director. I was trouble as I was silenced by a confidentiality agreement and a pay off for sexual harassment. Staff at the new office many months later apologised to me saying that I was alright and they had me all wrong. They said they shouldn’t have listened to the Director. It was too late, after months of being bullied and excluded – because I treated horrendously in the previous role and just accepted an apology. My advice is don’t – take them to court. They only care about money. "
"Security guard in work used to follow me around the office – to the drinks machine, to the toilet or to pick up stationary. One day he put his hands on mine and I pulled away. He told me that ‘I didn’t like being touched, did I?’ he would make comments about my figure etc. I had asked him to stop following everywhere I went in a nice way and one day I shouted ‘will you leave me alone?!’ This was not his job – and he only did it to me. He filed a complaint and I got a final written warning for ‘verbally aggressive behaviour’ I explained the reasons why and I was told ‘he is obviously just trying to impress you’ – he was also a compulsive liar – this again my female manager said ‘it’s ok to be a walter mitty’ and ‘this poor man had a family to feed’ As a 20 something female who was being harassed by a 40 plus year old security guard how is this acceptable? "
"In my new job I receive sexist comments on a daily basis, mostly focusing on my appearance (I’m not a model so it has nothing to do with my job). When I mentioned this to my boss he said people were just trying to be nice and pay me a compliment. I fail to see how someone guessing my weight and then asking if they’re right is a compliment. I don’t know how calling me ‘feminine’ is a compliment. Being told I do things ‘like a girl’ isn’t a compliment. I’m not a girl. I’m a woman. And anyway it’s completely irrelevant! I’m also bored of being called a ‘lady [job title]’, rather than just having my job title. Urgh. My gender makes no difference to my competence whatsoever. Every day I get comments, and every day I challenge it but it makes no difference because sexism is so normalised here. "
"When the men I work with do their job well, they’re just doing their job. When I do my job well, I get criticized for “doing too much” and there’s a palpable perception that I’m “overstepping” or “telling folks what to do”. I’ve even been told to “back off”. I’m so tired of having to deal with touchy perceptions from male coworkers, again and again. I’m tired of saying, “hey, I’m just doing my job”. I couldn’t be more non-threatening or easy-going. I’ve dealt with this time and time again, and now I just want to work ALONE, but it’s a challenge to find solitary work. When people talk of “taking work home with them”, this is the kind of stuff that they mean. We women cannot escape the negative gender stereotypes… soul crushing “banal” sexism surrounds us in every sphere, and it becomes toxic unless we can maintain a good sense of humor. Humor amidst chaos and negativity… quite a trick to carry off if you’re able. "
"One of the top executives at my firm asked me to write a presentation for him for an industry event – which I did. He calls me afterwards to say he added a slide & that he had told the audience I would laugh when I saw it. He sent me the extra slide and I was horrified to see it said: ‘good presentations should be like a mini skirt… Short enough to retain interest, long enough to cover the subject matter’. I saw him a few days later. He was very pleased with his witty slide & asked if I thought it was funny. I had thought long and hard what to say… I was going to ask what the ‘subject matter was’? In the end I simply said I found it highly sexist & offensive and not becoming of someone who was an executive & not appropriate for our company. He looked quite shocked and the incident was never mentioned again. "
"I am a early career scientist. I love my work but my negative experiences are grinding down my resolve to continue in this carreer. A few years ago I was raped by a man I considered my friend at a conference and since then I suffer from panic attacks prior to attending scientific meetings. At a conference this year I was groped by a company rep while walking between seminars. The majority of attendees at that same conference attended a wet t shirt competition at the hotel bar. When I wrote to the organising committee to complain they brushed off my complaint. I have also experience sexual harrassment and attempted rape from the manager of the facilities where I conduct my research. As he held me down on the floor he told me “I can do anything I want and there is nothing you can do about it”. Following the assault I had to go to work every day with him. It appears he has done similar things to multiple female students, including getting one former student pregnant. This week I will file a written report of his behaviour to protect other female students on this farm and to prove him wrong. NO he can’t do anything he wants – not to me and not to other women – and YES, there is something I can do about it. "

"I’m expected to keep notes in meetings by a male colleague on a project. (I am an analyst, not an admin or a secretary.) He keeps telling me what an awful typist he is and how wonderful (other) female colleague was to transcribe his notes on a previous project, even though he was also supported by a male team member who apparently did not transcribe his notes. He also consistently refers to me and another female colleague interchangeably, even though we look nothing alike and he’s met us both on multiple occasions. "
"I’ve been at my firm for over five years. A new co-worker started in a seniorish position, married with a teenage kid. At drinks after work one evening he told me, “You want to have sex with me, don’t you? Ever since I started.” I was stunned and didn’t reply. A few days later I confronted him to say his behavior was disrespectful. He apologized, acknowledged it wasn’t a good first impression, and said, “I just say stupid things when I’m drunk. You just have to know to walk away.” "
"As well as getting pissed at MasterChef’s John Torode for gendering food (as mentioned in a previous post), I’m also starting to get pissed at Gregg Wallace, albeit for a different reason. He insists on calling female contestants ‘love’ at fairly regular intervals, which really annoys me. I end up muttering “she’s not your ‘love'” or “she’d be a damn sight better if you didn’t call her ‘love’, mate!”. He did that quite a bit in the 2015 series. On the subject of MasterChef, that show’s opened my eyes to the sexism that’s rife in the catering industry. Male pro chefs outnumber the female ones, & some of the male chefs whose establishments the contestants do stints in also treat female contestants differently to how they treat the male ones. In one particular episode of Celebrity MasterChef, the 3 finalists (Jodie Kidd, Charley Boorman & Sophie Thompson) went to an Italian restaurant to cook for the Chef’s Table challenge. They cooked under a male Italian chef, who kept calling Jodie Kidd ‘darling’, & told her to liken one part of the dessert she was making to ‘putting her makeup on’. He didn’t say anything like that to Charley Boorman! I also remember another male Italian chef saying (in a different series) that a female contestant ‘should be more like a man’ in the kitchen (or words to that effect), which really annoyed me. Another male chef in a previous series said that a female contestant had ‘attitude’. He didn’t say anything like that about her male counterparts! And a male Spanish chef told a female contestant in a recent series that she should ‘keep cooking as a hobby’ (or words to that effect). He didn’t say that to her male counterparts- he asked them what they did for a living! So glad I don’t work in hospitality/catering, especially given what I’ve read on here about the appalling way in which women are treated in the industry! "
"While interning at a magazine, I had to have meetings with my boss to review the articles I wrote. Whenever I went in for my meeting he would tell me he loved my outfit or that I looked pretty. I brushed it off. However, during the meetings he clearly hadn’t read my articles and then told me repeatedly that they probably wouldn’t be able to publish them. One day he told me that he was trying to “sweet talk” me because he thought I should model for the magazine. So, he wouldn’t publish my articles but he would definitely publish my face? "
"I was at work hauling boats from the marina up a hill to the storage place and stopped to rest because my fingers were blistered from the handles and a man walks up and says “They need to hire a few men around here don’t they!” We are a staff of college age girls, and begrudgingly, it would be a safer work environment if there was a man on staff because we have had a man touching himself inappropriately while watching us at our place of work. None of us could approach him, because he looked us straight in the eyes and continued what he was doing when we addressed him. Not until a man came and yelled at him did he stop. "

"When I had just started as an intern at my new job last year, we had a meeting with all the owners, managers and their assistants. Before the meeting my boss introduced me and my male colleague to the owners. One of the (all-male) owners shook hands and introduced himself to my male colleague and afterwards shook my hand and, instead of the introduction-part, said “well this is quite a pretty girl that you have” to my boss. And all the old male-superiors stare at me and not saying anything. I felt like I was skipped as a human and like I didn’t matter as a professional, even though they didn’t know anything about me yet, like the men did. "

"My middle aged father works from home some days, during one phone conversation with a colleague I heard him refer to a woman’s name as ‘sounding like a porn star name’. Her last name I believe is ‘Lovely’. Both me and my mother overheard this, and when my mum confronted him about it and explained it was offensive, he just brushed it off and blamed her for listening to his conversation, despite the fact that he was shouting and guffawing down the phone loudly with the door open. I find it just utterly exasperating that my own dad can’t see what’s wrong with this sort of comment, but what’s really funny is he has no idea the women he works with think of him as that old fart that no one wants to be around (for a short while I worked at the same company). He thinks he’s really ‘friendly’ and ‘moral’ and not at all sexist towards women, because in his head it’s only sexism if you physically harass someone, or hit your wife. People talk about being disappointing in their kids, but my dad is a bigger disappointment to me than I ever though possible. After a lifetime of these sort of incidents, I’ve just lost all respect for him, but how can you respect someone who thinks it’s OK to verbally belittle half the worlds population, purely based on their gender? "
"Sorry this is so long but every time I see someone say there’s no sexism in the workplace anymore I want to tell them this whole story. A few years back I applied at a company to work in their web & design department. I didn’t get a callback after the first interview but I was called in a few months later to interview again. Two questions were about my skills. The rest were about whether I was married, if I planned to marry soon, what was my boyfriend’s job, if I had children, if I planned to have them soon. I wanted to tell him these questions were illegal and irrelevant — but I hadn’t gotten an interview in a year. My job at the time was outside my field and paying so little I was choosing between air conditioning or food in the summer — so I swallowed the humiliation. After a third interview with my future department leader I was hired. On the morning my first day, I accidentally overheard a coworker asking my department leader if his blow up doll had arrived yet today. At the time I was platinum blonde, was called curvy, and liked lipstick. I lived with the queasy in-between feeling where I suspected they were talking about me but also doubted myself and thought I was just paranoid and making things up. I still don’t know. Much later I discovered my department leader had actually been hired from the first round of interviews that I had also been on. He didn’t have a Bachelor’s in the field like I had, had much less experience, and hadn’t bothered with a web & design portfolio. Again, the queasy feeling of suspecting he was favored for being male but doubting myself and never being able to know for sure. Even later I discovered he was making very, very, much more than me. There were little things here and there over the years. My department leader constantly assuming I didn’t know things I’d learned years ago. Our freelance photographer joking that I shouldn’t be given the company credit card because I’d go on a shopping spree (I hate shopping and never said anything to make him believe otherwise). My coworkers commenting on and rating women’s bodies as they walked by (our office overlooked a busy sidewalk leading to a beach). My department leader and I eventually had a decent working relationship with a lot of jokes, but he started making overtures that toed the line. Touching my arm and hand more than necessary, asking to eat lunch together at our lunch breaks, talking trash about his wife to me despite my cold reception to it. It was nothing I could pin down as sexual harassment but as he got more moony-eyed I sensed disaster coming. Wanting to escape this situation, dissatisfied with my pay, and morally troubled by some things the company was doing, I decided to leave. My replacement was brought in for me to train. He asked me in apparent confusion how I learned what I knew. I thought it was bizarre but answered him politely and mentally dismissed it as awkward smalltalk. The next day, we were showing him what our freelance workers do and helping him learn their names. One in particular was a skilled web developer and SEO master who’d been working longer than we’d all been alive. We referred to her as “she” several times, but my replacement kept calling her “he” until my supervisor directly corrected him. At which point my replacement’s jaw fell open, he stared at the screen, and he said in complete shock, “a WOMAN did this!?” Sitting behind him in humiliation and silent anger, too stunned to think of anything to say, I understood why he had been confused at my ability to build websites. This 25 year old man had thought all women were simply too stupid to use computers and he didn’t even care that I was in the room to hear it. On my last day, my department leader asked me into an empty office and closed the door. I felt frightened and tense. He told me he “felt like we were breaking up” and gushed praise about my personality and said he’d never find someone else like me. I tried to end things with platitudes about how he’d come to like my replacement perfectly fine and ended up in an awkward sort of light hug. As I pulled back, his hand trailed down my thigh. I locked myself in the bathroom fighting off tears because it brought up visceral memories of the family member who sexually harassed me as a young teen and loved stroking my bare thigh in summer. In the weeks after I left, my supervisor kept trying to contact me through email and Facebook using questions about work matters as an excuse. After he “joked” about remembering my home address I finally blocked him. I live alone and despite myself felt tense and worried every time there was a knock on my door for a while after that. My former coworkers kept asking why I wouldn’t come back to visit and pressured me to come console my department leader when his father passed away three months later. I didn’t know what to say to them, feeling shame, wondering if I had invited his feelings or was making things up, guilt for not sending him a sympathy gesture, fear that if I did he would take it as invitation to start messing around with me again. Women being made to feel uncomfortable, afraid, and unwelcome in the workplace never ended no matter what people say. "
"I’m part of a mum’s Facebook group. One posted, “Show us your pics and tell us your stories of #Daddydressingfails. This will be hilarious. We all know you have them. #Dadshaming.” and a photo of her child, dressed by Dad in a onesie put on backwards. How would we feel if that was said about mums? “Post your pics of Mums trying to fix things #Mummygetsitwrong.” or some other stereotype. Dad shaming, man shaming, is not ok, any more than shaming mums or women is. How to respond?? Also recently sat through a meeting with two female colleagues and one male assistant. The two female colleagues discussed a movie star’s looks, how hot he was, how they’d let him “50 shades of grey” them in a professional meeting. The male coworker looked uncomfortable. Not ok, but wasn’t sure what to say. Have had so many of the same thing happen to me as a woman, by men, but it is equally not ok for women to do this. We have a long way to go!! "

I mean of course i’m in the wrong, how dare i wear something that makes working in a pokey office on a summers day just about bearable?!

"When I first started my secondary school, I was severely bullied for the way I looked. I wasn’t skinny, I had acne, among other things. I was continuously told that no person, whether they be male or female, would love me because I wasn’t pretty enough – that my breasts and my arse was too small for anyone’s liking. Fast forward a few years, and after puberty kicked in, the bullying became a small minority, but instead I was often groped and I was told that my “skirt should be shorter”. I had several of the boys in my class grab my thy, telling me that they were “sexy” and they would tell me what they would like to do to me. After a while, I had enough of the groping and the comments, so I went to tell a teacher. At my school, the majority of my teachers are male – but I decided to go to one of the few female teachers. The one that I went to told me to “stop making things up”, and dismissed the entire subject. The worst thing is that everyone at my school thinks that groping one another is normal, so the issue is a bit taboo. We need to educate each other that sexual harassment is not okay. "
"In the Army, accommodation for males is always arranged by rank – three separate blocks for officers, senior NCOS and other ranks. We women are always accommodated in the same room.

I suggested that if it wasn’t necessary to separate female personnel by rank then why did they do it for male personnel. He said it was to with respect for authority. I’m still pressing at every opportunity for equal treatment for female personnel. "

"I’m a guy, but I have an everyday sexism story to share. When I was leaving my old job, part of my offboarding repsonsibilities was to train my successor for her new responsibilities. When talking about my successor to one of my former line managers, his only question about her qualifications was: “So, is she cute?”. I openly told him that I don’t think it’s appropriate to judge on someones professional and personal skills just by their looks or appearance, and you could notice that I struck him with that answer.

"I called engineers in today to fix a piece of technical equipment I’m responsible for. They had my name as the contact, and I’d dealt with the company several times before. I have postgraduate qualifications and 25 years experience in my particular corner of the STEM universe. During repairs I asked what their findings were, but instead of talking to me the engineer insisted on explaining it in great detail to my completely unqualified male admin assistant. "
"I was working with a barrister and some solicitors on a case which required us to travel together. I was the only female and they mostly acted as if I was invisible. They started discussing how one of the secretaries was “really hot but acted desperate” and had “slept her way around the office.” They brazenly discussed whether she had had a boob job, and one of the younger men commented that she was also a model and that we should look her up to “see her in her underwear.” I felt pressured to remain silent but was angry and disgusted because these same men had previously spoken about how gender inequality in the legal industry needed to change.

"A colleague drunk texted me two weeks ago while he was at a festival, telling me he missed me “and your tatties, I mean titties.” When I confronted him on it later, he just shrugged it off and said “I thought you could take it”. No apology, or acknowledgement of what a creepy, inappropriate thing that is to do. Yesterday, a different colleague asked me out on a date, despite the fact that he knows I am in a happy, long-term relationship and, oh yeah, he himself got married a mere two weeks ago. We are all part of a larger group of people who go for coffee together every morning. I previously considered these guys my friends. Now I feel so uncomfortable and creeped out and angry that I can’t face being near them. Thanks to their stupid horny impulses, I’ve lost the one social interaction at work that I used to really look forward to every day. "
"I worked in Italy with Italian colleagues for a year or so back in the 90’s. Every day one man used to greet me with “Ciao blondie” because I had blonde hair. I let it go on for a few weeks, secretly fuming about being refered to as a hair shade, which made me feel as though that was the only thing he bothered to notice about me and the only quality he ever cared to discover about me. Eventually I told him how this made me feel and asked him to stop. The guy was genuinely taken aback and apologetic, he really had not considered it as harmful in any way and desisted immediately. So it is important to speak out and make men aware of their clumsy sometimes hurtful attitudes. It is our duty in fact, to point it out where we can and risk criticism but by doing so enlighten men and perhaps help another women avoid the same fate. I think men really struggle to relate to women sometimes. They do not know what to say or what the safe small talk topics are. When working in a Norwegian school recently, 8 out of 10 male teachers started conversations with me about English football and even when I replied that I had no interest in the sport, many of them persisted in chatting on about it! Shame really that these pretty smart people couldn’t manage to find more common ground with me. It was quite noticable.as it happened so many times. Another one I heard about was a husband whose partner had slaved away readying the house for a Christmas party. Upon arrival, one guest commented on how lovely everything looked to which the husband replied “Oh, the house just sort of looks after itself!” Now he did deserve to be strangled on the spot ðŸ™‚ "
"When I was 18, I managed to get on a work placement doing what I wanted to pursue later on at uni. I was the youngest in the whole office by 5 years, though the average age was probably late 30’s, and I was the only female in my department. On my smoke breaks I would often run into my boss’ boss, who I’d say was about 40. We would chat, he would tell jokes, sometimes of a slightly flirty nature, but I let him be, not wanting to cause a fuss as I’d only be there for a couple of months. I went on a night out with my other colleagues, and they all added me on Facebook. A couple of days later I got a request from my boss’ boss. I accepted, as he’d offered to help me with a job after I finished university. Over the course of the next 8 months, he messaged me several times, at first friendly, but then asking me about my sex life, trying to tell me about his, describing what he’d like to do to me, belittling my boyfriend and eventually asked me – with a very graphic description – for a blowjob. He got married during this time. I could never tell to what extent he was “joking”, but it made me feel so uncomfortable either way. He eventually got bored, but I hope it wasn’t because he found another innocent young woman to prey on. "
"I’ve been groped in a market in London; been told by a female boss that I had to look out because people won’t like because I am attractive; after excusing myself from work early to go to a doctor’s appointment, a male executive commented on my being naked; and have been privy to salaries of men and women — and have seen vast discrepancies. And have seen men expose themselves in Central Park (NY) and on the subway. And from other strangers, the catcalls, and why don’t you smile, and the “Hey, Mami” and the comments about my body and appearance. NOT COOL! "
"Every single day at work I had to put up with a male director telling me and others that he loved me, and I was his favourite, and that he wished his partner was more like me. and on occasions when drinking tell me I shouldn’t speak to his partner I should be binding with him instead. Made to feel uncomfortable in the workplace despite them all knowing I have a boyfriend. And forever, hearing that the men are weak and acting like women. "

That board voted 11-2 to keep the Executive Director. I resigned. On that same board, had another member ask how old I was, incredulous that I could be that articulate. I’m 49, he’s probably in his mid-50’s. That same member constantly called me ‘honey, sweetie’ to the point where I asked him ‘I’m fine, how are you sweetie?’ Prior to my first meeting with that board, I told the board chair that I would be taking my own notes on my ipad and did not want people to assume that I would be secretary. Sure enough, during the first meeting, when the subject of notes came up, one of the other board members said ‘Beth is taking them’. The board chair said ‘no, I will’. "
"Chaupadi: What can the Nepalâ€™s President do, who is also a woman? Recently, yet another utterly unfortunate Chaupadi related death happened in Dailekh district of Nepal where this ugly tradition continues taking lives of women and girls, despite Chaupadi was banned by the Nepal government in 2005 as a human rights violation. A lot of people argue that â€˜we have the law and itâ€™s just a matter of implementing it.â€™ People look at Chaupadi from physical and intellectual point of view alone, so they talk about the â€˜unsanitary, outdoors and unsafe cowshedsâ€™ where the young girls and women have to live during their menstruation, and the law that banned this practice. But Chaupadi is not just a physical and intellectual problem which one addresses with sanitary, indoors and safe aspects of physicality and having law against it, the intellectual aspect of this ugly tradition. As Chaupadi is a tradition, a part of culture, it is deeply an emotional aspect, more than just the physical and intellectual ones. Many part of the world, including Nepal, have had such traditions since thousands of years, that repeatedly disempowers women and girls and successfully establishes male dominations, the patriarchy. We used to have Sati-Pratha(women were forced to bourn themselves alive along with the husbandâ€™s dead body at the cremation), we still have Kannya-dan (giving a virgin away to the groom during the marriage ceremony), Dauri(it is not just a donation of cash and expensive assets during the marriage, rather thanking the groomâ€™s family for letting-off and taking away their burden of having a girl in a family) and Chaupadi in is another similar tradition that reinforces the patriarchy. Many traditional practices of discriminating â€˜othersâ€™, whether its cast-based or gender-based or sexual-orientation based, have been established through, not just â€˜brain-washingâ€™ but more through â€˜emotional-washingâ€™, which leads to a deep rooted belief about oneself, the traditions and the established hierarchy. Such â€˜Emotional-washingâ€™ allowes such ugly superstitions as Chaupadi. Letâ€™s look at the three aspect of Chaupadi problem: 1) Physical aspect: Girls and women are forced to spend time during the menstruation at unsanitary, outdoor, unsafe cowsheds. 2) Intellectual aspect: Girls and women are taught, from their childhood, that they become polluted during this menstruation period, hence they better-off retreating-away from daily normal life. 3) Emotional aspect: It is not just the families and communities but the girls and women themselves too believe that they actually become polluted during this menstruation period and they believe that it is good for themselves and to their families to live like that: unsanitary, outdoor, unsafe cowsheds during menstruation. So without tackling the emotional aspect, the belief, of this Chaupadi-tradition problem, only addressing physical and intellectual aspect wonâ€™t make much different. Nepal government, the UN, the NGOs can try and provide sanitary pads, asks the men and families to let them stay indoors; the law , which is already in place since 2005, can outlaw the practice legally; but the practices still continuing and girls and women still getting â€˜murderedâ€™ by this tradition. This is because the belief has not changed. It is far too ambitious to believe that law, awareness and distribution of sanitary pad can change such a long old tradition. To change the belief you need to do something radical, crazy and just opposite of the tradition, along with legal change, awareness and distribution of sanitary pad etc. Hon President, (and all the women leaders of Nepal) you may think the proposition I am making is crazy, radical and against the norm, but I want to you to consider exactly to do that so that you can contribute to demystify the belief around Chaupadi. 1) As you are not just a president (the head of state), you are also a women president; similarly you are not just president for the atheists and communists you are president of believers. Next time you have menstruation, please make it public and visit all the holy temples, shrines, etc. and I ask other women leaders to do the same. Because this will not only help people to believe that the menstruation is not a pollution but it is the integral part and the core source of human creation, which is holy and must to be celebrated. 2) Cook a fest during you next menstruation and feed others and feed yourself, to establish it as a celebratory event for every women and girls life. 3) Ask the government to include â€œnot just why Chaupadi practice is bad but why menstruation is good and natural processâ€? into the school curriculaâ€™s across Nepal. 4) You are not just president of Kathmandu; you are president of the whole country. Please visit districts like Achham and talk to the girls, women, children, men about the importance of menstruation, establish a tradition of celebrating menstruation. Celebrate menstruation with them. Establish this culture of celebration there in such districts. 5) Many women and girls may still be not connected by internet and social media, but its use is increasing far and wide day- by-day. I ask all the women and girls, who are in social media, do a campaign, announce your menstruation and celebrate it. I believe menstruation is a very intimate and private affair of women and girls, but when the same â€˜very intimate and private affairsâ€™ become the most disempowering cultural repeated events every month of your life, itâ€™s worth to change this â€˜private and intimate yet disempowering eventâ€™ into â€˜public, celebratory and empowering eventâ€™ for all women and girls. To really change the belief, culture and tradition you need to do something revolutionary, radical and against the norm. Most importantly, revolution can also happen with the flowers, worship and celebration; it does not need guns, fight and violence. All the women and girls in the world, particularly from Achham, Dailekh, Bajura, Humal Jumla districts of Nepal, you are blessed with the natural cycle of menstruation. Donâ€™t feel low about it, rather celebrate this natural phenomenon. Thank you and Namaste! "
"I am a practicing lawyer, have been for 16 years. I was in court regarding where a 3 year old boy should live I raised an issue to the white, male judge about the mothers current boyfriend and the fact that the police had been called to the mothers home because of a domestic dispute. I brought up the fact that mother had been arrested along with the child’s father for domestic violence. The judge interrupted me to ask whether the charges against mother were dropped. He knew they were already. I said yes but I did not know the reason, whether the father refused to testify against her or the prosecutor decided not to pursue it. The judge asked whether there was any evidence that the mother was anything other than a victim of domestic violence. I said yes, the police observed injuries on the father. The judge then asked me “doesn’t a woman have the right to defend herself.” I stood silent for a few seconds because I couldn’t believe he was asking me-a female attorney- whether women have the right to defend themselves from domestic violence? Was he actually expecting an answer? Did he think I would say anything other than “yes”? Clearly a sarcastic question. I answered that I’m not in court to debate with him whether a woman has a right to defend herself. I know women have a right to defend themselves because I’ve done it. I’m raising the issue to the court that mothers previous and now current relationships have instances of domestic violence and the court needs to know about it before saying a 3 year-old should go live in that home where DV might be going on. I said that is my job to raise questions for the court to look into and I was doing my job. Then I sat down. First of all, I do NOT need a 60-something year-old white man to mansplain women’s safety concerns to me. Haven’t countless women had to do it in some way, whether in a big way or small way? Walking with keys in your hand at night. Being followed on a city street and told to smile and why don’t you smile when someone compliments you? Having your legal career threatened by the married man whose romantic advances you politely declined and trying to figure out not to end up having to leave your job (which I had to do btw). Second, women can be guilty of domestic violence too. Don’t put women in a category that we can only be the victims. Woman can be the victims and women can be the perpetrators. Women can be good and women can be bad. Women are not statues on a pedestal that can never be in the wrong. I was doing my job to make sure a young child would not be sent into a home with domestic violence. No matter WHO was the perpetrator, no child should live in that environment. And I got women’s rights mansplained to me. Thanks “Judge”. I needed that lesson obviously. "
"Since when did “he used to be in the army” become code for “let him off every incident of sexism” ? Am hearing this one from multiple sources. What the hell are they learning there and how can we trust them to represent us abroad if they can’t get it right at home? One army man specifically told me he’d gone abroad to fuck foreign women. I think he meant sex workers in poor countries and am hoping he isn’t also a rapist but wouldn’t be surprised. The police have been round his house before. Why did he even feel the need to tell me that? Don’t need men to protect me, need men to respect me. And stop causing wars too, that would be nice. Weird how we are expected to be oh so grateful to the army but not call out the fact that it’s boys starting wars in the first place. My friend is a teacher in a posh public school and the worst sexist is the ex army man too. He is teaching teenage boys who already have staggeringly little contact with girls to denigrate women as much as he does, they just see women as meat or staff. Extreme Male gaze porn is normalised and the very few women there are talked over, subjected to constant “banter” which the male staff ignore and treat like a joke. The boys are already rich and intellectually arrogant, they are often looking to prove they are smarter than the female staff. But if a male staff member says anything he is instantly obeyed and deferred to . One of the male staff specifically makes public mocking references and put downs of women so she felt she had to challenge him privately but got nowhere. Doing so flags her as a potential trouble maker too. Another boy’s banter bullying is so sexually inappropriate that she had to challenge him too (always privately) and he was just delighted he’d got her attention. It’s a win for him as he thinks he’s wound up teacher and got a reaction it plays to the emotional female meme, never mind that she was totally calm. They don’t care and some of them will probably go into government, as their fathers already are. I honestly don’t know how any normal woman copes with “army male sexism” or “public schoolboy sexism” and I’m very glad I’ve met one decent army man and have seen men like tom hiddleston who arent like this but I fear both are a real problem. If you are born rich or carrying a gun you should be aware that you have extra responsibility, and sort out the basics. "
"The pet store I work at has quite a few regular customers, including one really (REALLY) old guy that comes in every Wednesday. I despise working day shift on Wednesdays because of him and his creepy old man ways. Numerous times he’s called my fiancÃ© “cheap” for not getting me a 4kt diamond ring (the ring has a blue topaz center stone with 2 diamonds flanking it, which we chose together), constantly tries to grab my hand and pull me out of the store, and has even made comments about my “drawers” being real. (Backstory on that: he always pays cash with $100 bills and we have to always check them so he jokes about them being fake. I once made the mistake of saying everything in my drawer (meaning cash drawer) was real. He “misheard” me. Right.) My boss tells me that he hasn’t been the same since his chemo a few years back and that I should just laugh it all off, but that’s no excuse for this dude to be as pervy as he is. And the kicker? Said boss is female. "

"Having just started Work Experience in Canary Wharf in London, I naively thought in such a professional environment there would be less sexism. There is, but there are still little things that are irritating. The way the women in the office with me are treated with utmost respect, but are still referred to as “the girls” as though they’re interns when they’re actually high ranking managers despite the men being correctly referred to as men. I know, petty, but it bugs me. Or how the male manager is addressed as sir by one member of staff, but the a female manager is addressed as ‘darling’ by the same person, showing less respect. Just tiny things that make up the big things. "

"Heard you on Leonard Lopate today. When my girlfriend was a PhD candidate at a large midwestern university, c. 1968, her faculty advisor told her that he didn’t like women in his classes, she was just taking up space that really belonged to a man, and that it didn’t matter anyway because he was going to give her an automatic “F”. She threw a chair at him. Subsequently, the professor only spoke to her when absolutely necessary and she graduated with honors. In organic chemistry. B. was also a “leader” in claiming space in the Men’s room when the lines were too long in the Ladies. I personally witnessed guys streaming out of the Men’s when she walked in. "

I had to come into work in the middle of the night due to a process upset, and I had to call in one of the electricians. He, who was old enough to be my father, subtly grabbed my butt. Unfortunately, if I reacted, he would have drawn out his work and ultimately I would not get to go home for a very long time. If I reported him to HR, I certainly would have been punished, as there was a culture of sexism at the plant. I felt violated and completely powerless. I wish I could say this happened in the 50s, but it happened in 2012. "

"When I was just out of university, I worked at a large food retailer’s warehouse distribution centre. The job was to answer all switchboard calls and route them to various other departments, and do a small amount of admin. As a result, I had to sit in reception all day, where everyone would wander past on their way to various departments. One senior manager would flirt with me, pretty harmlessly I guess, and he was friendly. But, it was awkward for me. Every lunchtime, I wandered down to the canteen, to ensure wolf-whistles as I ate, and nudges from ALL the guys, and whispers, etc. It seemed â€“ in this very male dominated workforce â€“ they’d not grown out of the 15-year-old boy stage. They never quite got over the fact that I was the new girl, and this went on for months until I left. Theen, one charming day, someone came into the reception to warn me to be careful about one guy who’d been talking to the others about what he’d like to do to me: pull me bodily right across the reception desk and do me right there. I was extremely afraid and had to change my start and finish time, as we tended to come in and leave at the same time (a bizarre coincidence that had always made me uncomfortable, but then I knew why). I felt creeped out around this guy, because, as it turned out, he was a creep. He then came into reception, realising that someone had “told” on him, and explained what he meant. Which wasn’t helpful. I was so shocked, I couldn’t say anything. I’m almost 20 years older now, and it still makes my heart race with fear. Let’s stop with all the pretense that this is complimentary. This behaviour is all designed to induce fear. "
"I just had a conversation about handling statutory maternity pay with a colleague responsible for HR. In addition to mentioning what an ‘inconvenience’ it is, he couldn’t stop looking down at my stomach over the course of about 5 minutes, as if we were having a hypothetical conversation about the state of my own uterus which required an extensive visual assessment – perhaps he feels if he checks out all women of assumed child-bearing age he can catch us or something?

Maybe it’d be less sexist if you made comments about the appearances of the male volunteers but you didn’t.

No – it turns out the senior boss was simply wanting to talk about the football last night. They had a good 5 mins chat about it and then he closed the door. When I made a comment, the senior boss simply totally ignored me as if I was entirely invisible.

He then asked when I was working next time. I wasn’t going to tell him so I told him I work Sundays which I don’t, after he left I told my supervisor what happened.

"While studying at a well-acclaimed, private university, I took an Advertising Concepts Studio in which the professor openly encouraged the class to design ads that demeaned and objectified women, encouraging one of my female classmates to depict naked women in an ad campaign and stating “No one will even look at your work if you’re not giving people something worth looking at. Sex sells. People, even women, like looking at a woman’s body; it makes them feel like they need whatever product you’re selling if you put a sexy chick in the ad.” He also encouraged me to depict 2 women in a way that would imply a sexual attraction between them as a means of using “shock value” to “make the designs memorable”. This went on for the duration of the course, and I refused to alter my work, or cater to his insensitive critique, which negatively impacted the final grade I received. "

Anonymous. My daughter reported a prison officer who was her supervisor he had 30 years service. He touched shoulders and her bottom. Was constantly asking for hugs and making comments. All in front of other staff who didn’t say or do anything…..she was taken seriously and he resigned. She was also on her training period and was concerned she would lose her job. After she reported it some colleagues said he had been doing it for years and why was she reporting it ! She was 19 he was 59. 
"I worked in a retail clothing store on the shop floor and it was all men. They were fine to a point, just very immature. The problem was the man who owned the business as he set the tone of the place. I got a taste of his lack of propriety at my interview as he asked me questions such as – Was i married? Had i ever been married? Had i ever been engaged? Did i just enjoy my own company? I have worked in retail for 20 or so years and in the context of the conversation, these questions were not appropriate. I believe he was trying to establish my sexuality as apposed to making some kind of advance. He also asked me if i minded cleaning. I thought nothing of this as it what is expected in retail. I assumed he meant cleaning the department i worked on. It soon became clear that he expected me to clean up after the other people who worked there. The staff room/ stockroom was grubby and very messy at times and when i was overheard expressing this by another member of staff and reported, i was told my my employer “well clean it then!” He also said to me that there were “some things women should not do.” This was in relation to me asking where the spare light bulbs were. He said he would get one of “the lads” to do it. This was not out of chivalry. Four days later it still had not been done. It was also suggested to me that i should show enthusiasm when asked to make drinks for the male members of staff “to show i appreciated how hard they worked”. As he put it. I was also was told to” man-up by” him. I heard vulgar and crude comments made about women on a regular basis.” She’ll be waiting on the bed with her legs open if you buy that mate.” is just one example. I haven’t documented the whole vile experience but it changed my view of people and the work environment. I watched an older man groom younger “men” by humiliating and manipulating them into accepting that bullying in the workplace is normal as is the sexaulisation and undermining of women. From the outside no one would know what goes on because there is a veneer of respectability that money brings. I wish i had found this site earlier as at the time i felt as if i was going insane. It was like being in a cult.Thank you for this space. "
"I used to work in a bank where the 3 senior managers subjected all the female staff to physical and verbal harassment every day. Nearly every morning my manager would grab me, press me up against his office wall, put his hand up my sweater and say: “what’s it going to be today? Mad passionate sex or just work?” I was so scared of him but tried to deal with it using humour (saying things like “I’ve got a headache today, it’ll have to be work”) because I knew I would lose my job if I complained. On another occasion the company CEO cornered me at the work Christmas party and insisted I leave with him to spend a night of “kinky sex” in a hotel – I was so terrified I hid in the ladies toilets for 2 hours until he gave up and left. This was the accepted culture of the organisation and none of the women, or the men for that matter, dared to challenge this dreadful behaviour because the top people in the organisation were the worst offenders. Finally our union rep dared to make an official complaint – all the women were taken into the boardroom and to,d to stand with our backs against the wall while the managers screamed in our faces: “did YOU complain about me?” Most of us were in tears, it was so traumatising. Then the following morning we were told the union rep had resigned and wasn’t coming back. I left soon after that. I was only 21 and I’ll never forget it. "

They routinely call me “darling” “sweetheart” and “honey” while my male counterparts are treated professionally. I’ve had pilots tell me that they’d like to kiss me, joke about liking shopping, and flirt shamelessly to get me to go give them perks beyond those their contract provide. It’s completely exhausting to resist being emotionally manipulated all day. And continue being professional and “nice” to them so when I am reviewed I am perceived as a pleasant employee. When male coworkers (with the same job as me) make routine sexist requests or comments my resilience is tested even further. I’m so tired. I want one day where I can do my job without needing to put up so many mental defenses. "
"I worked for two weeks in a pop up in Shoreditch. I got asked out several times, regularly got told I was hot and even had a group of stags come in to the pop up and try to dry hump me. Sometimes the compliments were flattering, but eventually it was just exhausting. I had to say no so many times, that I felt like my resolve being worn away. I also swing from anger to despair. I work in sales, of course I’m being friendly! I’m being friendly because I want you to buy something, not to get in your pants. So why are you surprised when I decline your offer of a date?!!!! Argh! It’s not like I didn’t mention I’m married! "
"At work we recently set up a community library in Indonesia for underprivileged communities. I received lots of ‘helpful’ suggestions. I got this message from a colleague: ‘Try to hire a good looking girl who can smile 24/7 as your librarian. NEVER hire a big fat lady as your library keeper. No one will come and I cannot help you again. I am sorry, I do not mean to discriminate but from my point of view we need a more attractive and proactive girl who can offer books to everyone who passes the door’. (I had to tell him we actually ended up hiring a male librarian as we based the selection process on previous experience and who was the best candidate for the job). Another colleague said this: ‘make sure you have a ‘ladies section’ that has plenty of cook books in it and tips on how to be a good wife’ We also planned to set up a ‘young engineers’ workshop at the library after it opened as one of the many community/youth focused activities we set up there. The response from my line manager: ‘Great Idea!! The local boys will love that when we invite them’ – it didn’t even occur to him that the sessions would include girls. I could go on for hours about the comments that have been made! "
"I used to work for a large US firm in a European country. The Managing Director of the firm- my boss- had a reputation for “liking girls” a bit too much. In fact, one of the female Directors under him was said to have slept with him in exchange for a her position in the firm. During a trip outside the country with him, and after complimenting me for my looks, he suggested we go up to his room, using my potential position in the firm as a claim: “ask me for anything”. I played dumb and ask him to hire a few more people for my team, and smiled… I felt threaten. I did not how else to react and was later paralyzed in my room, wondering if I was, as my mother use to tell me, “too nice with men”. I did not inform the company, afraid he would fire me. They did anyway a few months later, when that female Director took his position. Now I deeply regret not having said anything, not for my sake, but for others who will be put in my position and might not have the resources or the courage to say no. Men like him should be punished and publicly ashamed. "
"I’m doing a training this week in high performance computing. As usual, I’m the only woman in the room. The instructor this morning was doing a bit of online shopping using the presentation screen, came across a page with offers on kitchen supplies, and felt compelled to say with some delight “There you go, Adrienne, something for your kitchen!” As if I’m the only person in the room who could possibly be interested in kitchen supplies. Never mind that I’m the star of the class, I really should get back to that kitchen…. "
"Not my real name because sometime the only way to get away from sexism is to leave your job and I haven’t managed it yet. I hear my boss call women dolly birds, ignore female leaders in our workplace and bully women and men he considers weak. I hear him being mysogynistic and homophobic regularly an he has bullied me on and off for nearly three years. My male line manager won’t do anything about it because he says its my word again him and if it went public people might back him not me. "
"I wore a black and white dress with pink trim and pink belt to the office. In the kitchen I was told by a visiting male consultant that the only thing missing from my outfit was a pair of pink rubber gloves for doing the dishes. Shocked speechless, it took me a few minutes to figure out why I felt as though I had been slapped in the face. "
"Spanish airline Iberia has been slapped with a fine for forcing female job applicants to undergo pregnancy tests, prompting a outcry over sexism. Iberia drew scorn on social media after claiming the measure was aimed at ensuring â€œthe wellbeing of the baby and future motherâ€?. It had argued that the test for flight crew applicants was not intended to filter out expectant mothers, but instead make sure they were placed in roles that would not involve any risk to the pregnancy. But authorities in Mallorca – where the practice was originally discovered – rejected that claim, ordering Iberia to pay â‚¬25,000 (Â£22,000) for what they described as a serious act of gender discrimination. Iago Negueruela, the work, trade and industry secretary for the Balearic Islands government, said Iberia was guilty of a “very grave infraction” and that men and women could not be given different tests for access to work.

"My boss, old enough to be my father tried it on with me- He’d comment in front of my male-strong team on my ‘weight loss’ and ‘how it made me beautiful and attractive’, he even said that I ‘had a good bum’. But he was old enough to be my dad, and I wasn’t interested. So his harassment turned nasty and personal- he obliterated my character within my young career and lost me a new position that was going to lead to a doctorate, all because he lied about ‘my character’. When I reported it to HR, they moved me from my team and put me in a lower paid position working unsociable hours- my former ‘team mates’ didn’t bother to stand up for me. After a Psychological referral, a suicide attempt and loss of over 5 stone due to lack of eating I attempted to take legal action- to no avail. Now i’m working a job paying minimum wage and have to start from scratch regarding my career. Turns out that a First Class Honours degree from one of the best unis is nothing in comparison to a sexism and vile male boss. He kept his job, sanity and dignity whilst he stripped me of mine for good fun. "
"The other day at work, I got screw over in a dire way. A male colleague volunteered to cover my evening hours because I had class and I couldn’t do it. Then, 15 minutes before he was meant to show up, he told me he had other plans because he hadn’t known that he DEFINITELY had to come (even though I clearly told him several times over the course of a few days that it was sorted with management and they THEY expected him to come) and it wasn’t his problem, it was mine. As I frantically tried to sort a solution, another male colleague started mocking me in front of customers asking “Aww, are you going to cry now Tarry??”. I told him to gtfo of my face if he knew what was good for him, and to leave me alone. He never would have spoken to a amale colleague in such a way. Now I’m dreading work tomorrow because I’ll have to see all of them and I KNOW it will be made to seem like it was all my fault somehow. "
"For three years whilst at university I worked as a lifeguard. A male colleague only a year or two older than me would constantly grope me on poolside in front of members and other members of staff. I would constantly tell him it made me uncomfortable but he just continued and would joke that “I loved it”. It got to a point where one evening I told him to stop, he again refused, so I told my line manager what was happening. Later that evening said colleague followed me into the stockroom, with the door shut and the lights turned off. He immediately began aggressively groping my bum and grabbing my breasts and repeatedly asking me “why was I snitching on him” and “why was I spreading lies about him”. He hit me so hard that the walkee talkie I had attached to my shorts fell and smashed on the ground. I pretended that it wasn’t happening and continued to grab the cleaning equipment then made excuses to leave. In tears I ran to my line manager to tell him what had just happened. Around 1am I got a text from my colleague saying he was sorry. The company did nothing. It was a case of he said-she said, as immediately after it happened I took a few month off to focus on my second year exams, meaning the CCTV footage no longer existed. When I returned the GM ran an investigation which went nowhere, I was constantly chasing him up to find out what was happening. Eventually that lifeguard left – only for them to re-hire months later, after which I left the company. Again, they did nothing. "
"Aged 18, and in my first year at University I went for a job interview at a pub, I got the job, but not before the much much older male interviewer stroked my hand and told me how attractive I was and that we would have fun. I was completely intimidated. Needless to say I did not go back, I was actually quite scared. This is one of too many stories I could tell. When I look back at my more vulnerable self I fear for her, and i guess i probably still do fear,otherwise why would I have developed a hard faced attitude to counteract this kind of behaviour? Even so that did not help when a few years back a manager used to constantly stare at my breasts,( just to make it clear the poor things were not even on display) and on discussion with another female colleague it appeared I was not the only one, I said nothing, I did nothing , he is probably still spending his days staring at female colleagues chests while they try to update them on their projects progress ….. how do you challenge something like that? We certainly did not feel empowered to do so. "
"I have witnessed a proposed salary decrease (in writing) because the employee was on maternity leave and her boss didn’t like it. I have been told that maternity leave is ‘fine’, but in return women have to ‘give something back’. I also feel as though being a woman in my thirties, there is heavy discrimination. It is hard to get a job, as employer’s believe that you are at risk of taking maternity leave. I have seen young female members of staff being called ‘vulnerable’ and pressured to met older married men at the weekend. Inappropriate messages being sent to female members of staff asking her about her sexuality and asking her to ‘approach’ a woman on his behalf. "
"I am a feminist, I even write about feminist stuff as an academic. but yet, i had the sudden realisation a year ago that when confronted with stuff I actually don’t do anything. I think that i would. In a firm I worked the guy that owned the building we worked in followed me up the stairs spanking my bottom. I laughed it off and told myself he was a tragic comic figure of an old daily mail reading, game hunting, sexist man. Working as an academic in univeristy a very senior member of staff told me that because the zip at the back of my dress was a cm low that it was ‘a provocation’ and the same man’s office looked out on the sink and he used to watch me wash up-could feel his eyes on my bum, and one day i had trousers that zipped up at the back- (to make a front profile that was flat- ‘cos’ aren’t known for their bondage trousers!), he told me ‘they’re kinky!’… he suffered from depression, and i didn’t want to get him into ‘trouble’ and he was a really nice guy… that it was fine… A phd student who was placed to work with me while i was teaching- and despite my much greater experience was super patronising during shared tutorials… culminating in him spanking my bottom with a measured rule at the end of year exhibition in the same room that other members of staff, students, parents, were looking at the work and whilst my son and husband were in the other room… "
"I was working (kinda public service? Or maybe hospitality? It’s a position at a museum) and an older gentleman overheard me cracking my knuckles. Yes, a disgusting habit, but not really any of his business. However, he felt the need to let me know I ‘didn’t get away with it’, so I tried to strike up a conversation and do my job, and he started giving me a half hug, and was whispering in my ear. It’s a loud area, so I wasn’t super thrown, but his grandkid was right there, and by whispering in my ear, he is totally cutting him out of the conversation. I’ve gotten desensitized to a lot of crap working here where you are literally a tool to enhance people’s visits, so they don’t always treat you like a person, especially if you are female. You become a bit of a decorative interactive map or something. But my fuck you meter was tripped when he would not drop the knuckle thing. He actually asked what my boyfriend said about that. Assuming I’m straight, assuming I’m in a relationship, and assuming I factor my partners opinions into what I do in my spare time. It was out of nowhere, with no leadup whatsoever. One second I’m reassuring him that I’m not going to make my knuckles swell, and he follows up with that. I don’t think he even knew that any of his behavior was not ok. My biggest regret is that I panicked in the face of such bold idiocy, and didn’t tell him I was a lesbian. (I would be lying, which is probably why it wasn’t at the tip of my tongue, but I would pay to see his face.) "
"All the women at my office were instructed to have a meeting regarding dress code, since we recently hired a few new women. I was told I can’t wear spaghetti strap shirts anymore. I genuinely cannot wrap my head around a logical reason why this would matter. I do my job well. I very much enjoy picking out my work clothes and try to look stylish and put-together. Why is it that my shoulder is a problem? Is it my bra strap? I could go without a bra – I’d love to go without a bra – but I feel like that might raise another issue. Another girl was advised to leave jeans for Fridays, yet her boss wears jeans every day. This woman is being instructed to invest more into her work clothes than her boss, purely because a woman in jeans reads as too casual. I was incredibly annoyed by this meeting, yet when I slightly voiced my annoyance, I looked like I was too sensitive because none of the other women were annoyed. "
"Last week I bought a small house and scheduled appointments for contractors to view and bid on small construction projects. A man viewing my bathroom’s leaky tile grout: 1) Arrived an hour late with no notice or explanation. 2) Asked, “So, is your husband handy?” 3) Insisted I need a new toilet because the present one has GERMS. I work outside the home as a professor, I previously worked as a professional carpenter, and I’m well educated in microbiology. Yet most workers assume I stay in the house around the clock, rely on my husband to fix things, and will believe any bullshit they say. Something about being a woman in Utah… Conveniently I hired a different worker to re-do the tile: he shows up on time, treats me like an adult, and doesn’t make up shit. Golden! "
"I work for a japanese finance company. They pretend to be all for equality with a women in business week. Yet a Senior Manager made smutty comments about a group photograph on an annoucement (as a male manager was standing a bit close behind the woman) saying “he looked pleased with himself” and similar remarks then encourages other staff to look at it.

"I work in the construction/engineering industry on a very major engineering project in London, in a fairly specialised role. Today I was having a conversation with two of my team engineers: one male, one female, with the male sitting in the middle of our line. Iâ€™m talking, and the female team member answered and I carried on speaking, when a man I had never seen before walked over with two other men in tow and cut straight across my conversation and said to XXXX, the male in the middle of our conversation, â€œSorry XXXX, need to ask you something and thought Iâ€™d rescue you from a boring conversationâ€? and smirked at me. Jaw-droppingly rude and rendered me speechless for a second. I stared at him for a couple of seconds and then replied with â€œMarvellous! Sexism in the workplace continuesâ€? – he went â€œNonsense , itâ€™s not that at allâ€? and then carried on speaking to my engineer whilst completely ignoring me or apologising for is rudeness . I subsequently find out this person is the replacement Project Field Engineer on this particular site. Our future Interface Meetings are going to be fun! "
"Within a few weeks of starting a new job, a co-worker was regularly being very forward – inappropriate hugs, telling my my ‘arse looks nice’, telling me he wants to kiss me when we when no-one else was in the area of the office to see/hear. I consistently told him ‘no’, to which he repeatedly (and quite aggressively) asked ‘why’. Several months later, when it had calmed down marginally, I agreed to go for one drink after work, and I made it clear that it was as a colleague, and made him agree to this. He proceeded to touch my leg inappropriately and hold my hand, and ask me when I was going to kiss him. He said that me saying no over and over again made me ‘more of a challenge’ and that ‘I will get you one day’. What was almost worse was that multiple friends said that it was my fault because I agreed to go for a drink. And the fact that I didn’t slap his hand away meant that I was accepting it/giving consent – I always thought that I would in that scenario, but in when it actually happened, I just froze in fear and was clearly very uncomfortable. I’ve been told that I need to say ‘no’ nicely, but then also told that it’s my fault for leading him on because I didn’t say ‘no’ firmly enough (even though I said it repeatedly over many months) – I can’t win. And either way ‘no’ never seems to be enough. "
"The Park I took my children to the park and happened to see an old classmate with his child. We chatted a bit. Through the course of conversation he mentioned he was having trouble finding a job and was looking for full time work. My workplace was hiring at the time so I told him as long as he was drug free and could pass a background check, he could get a job with benefits. He hung his head and said “I can’t work there.” Remembering he had a drug conviction I apologized, but suggested he might be able to get it overturned because our new recreational use law passed. “Oh…it’s not that. I’m not supposed to be around kids.” “Wait..what do you mean?” He breezily answered “Oh, I’m a sex offender. It sucks how you make one mistake and it ruins your life. Am I right?!” The shock must have been VERY obvious because he said the following (abridged): “This girl comes over to my house wanting some action. I say OKAY! I’m a guy and can’t say no to that kind of attention! Well her parents weren’t happy and called the cops on me. She took a rape kit and of course they found a tiny sliver of DNA. How is this my fault? She’s a total slut. She came on to me. Sure, she was 14 and I was 21 but she was totally into it. This bitch ruined my life so I had my friends harass her at her high school. Pretty great huh? I don’t get why all my friends stopped talking to me.” I stared at him. “She ‘was a slut’ so you thought sex with a 14 year old wasn’t going to make you a sex offender? You did this knowing she was 14?!” “Well, when a girl puts herself out like that sex is going to happen. It’s like giving a dog a hamburger. It’s there–so go for it! It’s not my fault I’m a guy and I shouldn’t have to pay for it for the rest of my life. I mean, I’m an honest guy. I admit what I did.” I have seen all of my male college friends say no to sex with an under-aged person. I’ve seen them say no to sex with ladies our age. I was proud to know these folks since they have always taken responsibility for their actions. Now I had a registered sex offender looking at me and expecting pity. “You’re full of shit. If you don’t want lifelong consequences don’t break the law.” He also learned not to tell a Mandated Reporter with a cellphone ‘I am a rapist who isn’t supposed to be around children’ at a playground! A Newspaper This is not the first time I found out one of my classmates was a sex offender. Shortly after I graduated from high school I saw a familiar face in the newspaper. Under his name was a “LEVEL 3 SEX OFFENDER” alert. A Level 3 Sex Offender is the most likely to re-offend. Underneath his picture was his sex offender history that started prior to him starting high school: Molestation of a child, rape of a child, incest… the list went on. He was a level 2 sex offender when he entered high school. As a minor, his status was protected. The history stated he had started offending against young relatives, including his siblings. He started luring and attacking neighborhood children. His most recent offense was for luring and raping a 12 year old. I had just started college and his wife was in my math class. She told me she was having a hard time lately and now I knew why. The next day she told me she had known about his criminal history. They got married when they were both attending high school. She said he told her he was in therapy and everything was okay. She forgave him for being a sex offender because “He was such a nice man! He just made a mistake.” Nice men aren’t rapists. It’s Me! Colleges issue Sex Offender Notices if an offender (who is not a minor) is attending the college as a student. A Level 2 Sex Offender/student became a Level 3 Sex Offender during Spring break. New notices were plastered all over. I was walking to my class when a man jumped out of the bushes and tried to grab me. I elbowed him and yelled for help. He kept yelling “Wait, wait! It’s me!” I don’t know who you are! Leave me alone!” My fists were flying and I continued to yell until campus security finally heard. They didn’t. “Stop hitting me! It’s me, ‘Frank’!” I looked and recognized my friend from Science class. I started hitting him harder. “What the hell is wrong with you! You don’t jump from the bushes and grab girls!” He rolled up into a ball. “Why are you hitting me more?! But…it’s funny! Grabbing girls from behind is funny–they like it!” “Grabbing girls isn’t funny, idiot! It’s scary! And creepy! WE DON’T LIKE IT.” Campus security never showed up. I went from scared to angry in a split second. We are obviously not friends anymore. He whined how I ‘didn’t have a sense of humor’ and was surprised how angry I became. Thankfully he did realize what he was doing was not acceptable. ‘Frank’ stopped grabbing girls. I get a lot of flack for telling this story. I am told “You shouldn’t hit people. It isn’t nice”. I WILL hit someone when I think they are attacking me. I WILL hit someone who is ‘play attacking’ (such as grabbing me from behind!) ‘as a joke’ because IT IS NOT A JOKE. I’ve seen women physically bullied by men (being dragged by an arm, being pushed, shoved, grabbed, etc) because these ladies either didn’t know how to fight back OR thought that ‘hitting isn’t nice’. YES. I have heard women and girls say that! Learn how to defend yourself. It doesn’t mean you’re picking a fight. "
"In my last job, we had a new starter. Our boss suggested all of us going to the pub for lunch on her first day to welcome her. We were sat around the table in the pub. The boss called us to attention, saying he’d like to welcome our new starter. He told her to stand up. She did, nervously. He then said that the real reason she got the job was her thigh gap. None of us work for him any more. "
"When I was on a placement at an American university, I was reading in the library one evening and a man I did not know came and sat at the table next to me so that I was shut in – I couldn’t get out again without him getting out of his seat. After a while, I realised from his breathing and movements that he was masturbating under the table. I did not know what to do and pretended I could not hear or see and carried on reading. He finished and got up and left. I just do not know what I could have done – I could have shouted really loudly and hoped a librarian would have come, but would anyone have believed me? Why did he feel he could just do that? There were other people around but not many, and it was quiet. "
"This happened some time ago. I went to the kitchen for my morning cup of tea only to be told by a colleague that he’d dreamt about me last night. Forget that he is 10 years married with four kids, in his dream he had a good feel of my ass. Just in case I wasn’t clear about what he said, he mimicked the action using his hands in front of me. I was so stunned I didn’t know what to say so just left. I told my boss. She asked if I would like to make a complaint but I didn’t. I spoke to a few others females around the office who kind of brushed it off saying that was just him and he was harmless. I’m very cross to this day that I didn’t. "
"When I was in the norwegian military, the few girls there were commented on if they wore underwear in the hallways. One boy in particular thought that we should cover up because he said it was too revealing. Anyhow, this boy and every other male person in the building could walk around in their boxers without anyone having a problem with it. Also, boys were disgusted when they found out some of the girls used the boys bathroom during the night (which was on the same floor as our rooms), due to our bathroom being on a completely different floor. They said it was because there could be boys in the bathroom at night jerking off, and if there were, they’d obviously would like some privacy. "
"Seeing the BBC headline today “Half of women say they’ve been sexually harassed at work”, reminded me of a time in my early 20’s when I was working in a bar in London. A male colleague said “your tits look saggy today”, and pointed out that this was because I was wearing a bikini top under my t shirt rather than a bra. He suggested that I wear a bra in future. I laughed it off, and would never have reported it because I was really embarrassed. However I am now in my mid-30’s and since then I have not work a bikini top without serious structural support involved, and I have always thought my boobs are saggy. What a shame! At the time I was about 23, there was no way my boobs were actually saggy, and in any case even if they were who the hell was he to comment on them? "
"At work, the men flirt with me, I don’t think they’d talk to me if they thought I was ugly, they’ll put their arms around me and touch my arms, shoulders, hands, and I laugh it off, but I wish I didn’t, I want to say “stop” but I don’t. They don’t seem to think about why someone wouldn’t like that. "
"I was talking to an ex-teacher a couple of days ago who had spent 20 years in a state comprehensive which had a crÃ¨che for girls who had had babies, and the pregnant ones were included in normal daily lessons. When the school closed, the teacher found a job in the local Ursuline convent, and commented on the fact there were no such facilities. It turned out the girls were expelled if they got pregnant. Why were they punished? Presumably because they did not conform to the supposedly “virginal” feminine caricature. A comedienne not so long ago described girls as being brought up to be female impersonators. Too blooming true, and I was not very good at it. But I suspect girls are now being trained to be female impersonators impersonating men, but without the luxury of having “wives”. My mother impressed on me that men/boys never liked clever girls/women (when I had just come top in my year). School careers counselling advised me that someone “of my undoubted intelligence” should go into teaching, which would fit round my husband and family. Despite having worked to support him through medical school and a doctorate in the early years of marriage, my husband left me when I wanted to go back to work after having children, because “who would look after him?” He had no answer when I asked him who looked after the female doctors in his practice, except of course that they “only” worked part-time. I am tired of men calling me Darling and Sweetheart now I am older, and I positively rage against people who call me by my legal first name without asking how I would like to be addressed, which would be Ms or Mrs X or Madam. Using a first name seems infantilising and disrespectful to me. I despair at the pink and blue dichotomy most particularly in products for young people, and at the way so many other items are genderised. There is nothing wrong with pink, but we are being brain-washed and ill-served by big business. When are we going to have sports reports on e.g. “men’s football” as well as “women’s football? “24th July 2016: 8064 pages as of today since March 29th 2012” from Hannah 50 pages back from today – at 10 posts a page that’s more than 85,000 stories of everyday sexism. One hundred years on from suffragism, why are we still fighting the same prejudices!? Why is this rage not more obviously in the public domain? "
Squeezed up against the wall in a narrow store cupboard when I was 22 yrs old by a man in his 60’s. It wasn’t necessary for him to be in there. He worked there years..I had not. No way could I speak up about him. 
"I was Sexually harassed by a work colleague, he was sending me vulgar messages and asking for oral and physical sex in both messages and verbally., I reported it and the employer told me I had to get on with it and still deal with the person. I complained again and they got him to write a “Letter of apology” which wasnt an apology per say it was more of a Brag at what he had done. I am going to tribunal but am currently off work as I feel sick and scared that this man is still walking around my workplace. The place has closed ranks and are looking after him even though he admitted it, the problem is its taken over 6 months already for the system to work and this has put extreme pressure on my relationship at home between my husband and children. The timing should be reduced! "
After being sexually harassed by a colleague for 3 and a half years he sent me a picture of his erection and sexually assaulted me. I forwarded his emails to his wife and reported him for sexual harassment. He had no case to answer as he said I asked for it and I was sacked for harassing his wife. When I reported him for exposing himself to me my Female manager said “Perhaps it was necessary to say no more than once.” 
"In my work almost everybody has a university degree and is a specialist in their field. A senior colleague of mine has been getting away for the past three year with making condescending comments about women or regarding women. A few of many examples: female colleague makes a point during a meeting, he questions it loudly and asks a male colleague what the real story is. A formal dinner is being organised, a female guest discussed as perhaps not being the right person to join the specialist discussion and his response is ‘it does not matter, keeping quiet is not a bad thing for a woman’. "
I’m a nurse. I get flirty comments all the time from older men. Most of which I laugh off. But one which stays in my mind is an 80 year old man telling me I was beautiful and attractive and I had a good figure etc and he’d would marry me tomorrow. Then later I went back to nurse him again and he said he had changed his mind. He was already married to his wife so he would keep me as his ‘dirty weekend plaything’.

"I am studying for a Maths degree. When I tell people this, I’m often asked ‘Ahh, so what do you want to be, a teacher?’… No. NO I DON’T WANT TO BE A TEACHER. Do people ask me this because I’m female? Do they ask male maths students if they want to go into teaching, or do they ask them if they want to go into finance/engineering/further study etc? A female friend on my course said that she also regularly gets this response. I’m currently on a placement, working in finance, and even people at work have asked if I want to go into teaching. Does the fact that I’m doing a financial placement not give a clue that no, I do not want to go into teaching? I generally pull my face and say ‘definitely not’, then tell them what field of work I would actually be interested in. In my head I’m rolling my eyes at them. I know it isn’t deliberate sexism, but it still drives me crazy. "
"I have a book full of incidents from my last workplace but here are a few. My boss asked me to buy him condoms from the supermarket when I asked him if he’d like me to pick him anything up for lunch, he also asked me in front of a group of men if I liked foreplay, on another occasion he had an associate on speaker phone discussing how ‘dirty’ they thought I’d be in bed. When I had a miscarriage I had to go in work the next day to explain to him and another director (also a man) what was going on. I was smacked on the bottom and he was constantly asking me to ‘sit on his knee’ this is only the tip of the iceberg I got so ground down with it all I just left. "
"As a young and junior woman, I was telephoning a work contact (an older man who had been rather difficult in previous meetings) to set up a future meeting to discuss a project. About an aspect of planning, I said ‘I’ll check with ‘A’ (my boss) – he’s just here.’ The man on the phone said ‘Are you sitting on his knee?’ I thought I had misheard or it was a joke and said ‘I beg your pardon?’ and he slowly repeated the same sentence. I put the phone down. His remark felt hostile, angry, and undermining. There was no reason for the remark. I refused to deal directly with the man again. We got the project done, but the incident stuck in my mind. It felt as if he could not stand having to plan with a younger, junior woman as his opposite number and just had to undermine me. "
"I was not given the opportunity to apply for a managerial position even though arguably I am better qualified in a number of ways. I found out too late, after the position had been filled. I am trying to change systems from within the business. Two of my young female colleagues are suffering abuse from a fellow male worker. This is being addressed but has been apparent for a few weeks now. I don’t feel the managers in that section closed it down soon enough. Is this lack of training and knowledge? It appears that sexism is systemic in the construction industry although it can be subtle enough to go unnoticed. How can we protect the more vulnerable members of our work community, not just on grounds of sexism but also other protected characteristics? How can we make sure that everyone understands these issues and they are not allowed to evolve further? I am looking foward to retirement but I feel sad that there has been so little progress since the 1970s "
"I am an early career scientific researcher in a field in which men outnumber women. Recently, after giving a talk at a conference I was discussing my work with a couple of other participants, including a male professor and respected figure in his field who said that he did not understand a word of my talk but that I presented nicely and I should be in Hollywood. I was shocked, but took it as a compliment of my presentation skills. But I am angry that he belittled my work and objectified me in front of my peers, and even more angry I didn’t confront him about it as I didn’t want to look angry/bossy. "
Senior colleague talking to me about another female colleague: “she’s so hard to work with I call her vinegar tits”. 
"I was on a business trip with my bosses (2 men) and we walked past children. They all looked so carefree, happy and innocent, and I remarked on it asking my boss in a jokingly fashion what happened to us. One of my bosses then leant uncomfortably too close to me and whispered to me: “Men – Men happened to you” ??? I was shocked to say the least. I could not believe he would make such a comment which is completely inappropriate. I was angry that he would presume to know about my private life, which he knows nothing about, yet I kept quiet. Why, because I was scared. I was intimidated and scared that were I to challenge him and rebuke him, it would have an impact on my job, and so I kept quiet. "
I was working late last night as we have a large and important project at work. The office was full of men and me. One of the senior project managers asked me when he was leaving if “I didn’t have to go home to my family tonight”. He didn’t ask any of my male counterparts the same question but I know they’ve all got children too. 
"I am pregnant and yesterday was my 20 week scan. It was also the day my new boss started, something I had been looking forward to as we had been waiting for a person to take the position for some time. After my appointment, feeling elated by the news I was having a boy, I made my way to work and went to my boss’s first team meeting. During the meeting he asked me, after hearing I would be taking maternity leave, whether I would be coming back afterwards. I was very embarrassed as the whole team were looking on and mumbled ‘I think so’. After the meeting, I talked to the boss about taking part in a new project he had mentioned and encouraged people to volunteer for. He looked towards my bump and said ‘well if you hadn’t been so irresponsible’ – it was clear he thought that by getting pregnant I had forfeited any right to show interest in furthering my career. At this point he asked me my name despite having been introduced previously. "
I interviewed for a company which proudly states that they are an equal pay company. During the interview I was asked if I was planning on having children soon. Initially shocked I answered no. I was offered the job but turned it down. When asked for a reason I told them I found the question inappropriate. 
"Just asked for a wifi password at work. I had to walk down into the tech department at work to ask for it ask as emails were ignored. When I asked for the password, the man I was asking just took my phone out of my hand and said what do you need it for? I said for wattsapp messages mainly. He made a snide remark about how ‘important’ that must be..then just started scrolling through my phone and entered the password without asking permission to take my phone out of my hand. Very rude and Iseriously doubt that this would have happened to a man. I am 34 and not I’m not inferior. "
"After living and working on my own in Switzerland for four years (I had separated from my husband a year before I moved), I was told I would need my estranged husband’s signature to access the pension that I had paid into in the country. A bit difficult as my ex lived in New Zealand! In the end, had to arrange a quickie divorce online with the help of a divorce lawyer friend in order to be able to access my own money!! "
I started a new waitressing job a few weeks ago and one of the guys in the kitchen has taken a bit of a shine to me. Every time I walk into the kitchen he whistles or makes some remark about my bum and says how ‘fit’ I am. Last night as I walked past him he slapped my bum and demanded my phone number. I feel like I have no right to stand up to him as its ‘just kitchen banter’ and I’m new. Sadly I’m already looking for a new job. 
"I was selling some things online, and a user of the sales portal used my contact information to text me very inappropriate stuff. At first I did not understand what he meant, because I was selling shoes, and he was asking about socks, and his grammar was inconsistent. So I asked him if he could clarify. After a couple confusing texts, he finally spoke his mind clearly: He asked me if I would wear pantyhose for a few days to make them smelly, and then send them to him. He offered to pay a little money for each pair. Then he started to send me kissing emojis. I immediately blocked his number without responding further. It made me feel scared, because this man had my phone number. I immediately deleted my number and other person-specific information from my profile on the sales portal and will take subsequent action of giving his number to the portal administrators, so they can block him as a user. It also made me feel really tired and frustrated, because I had to change my number last year because of another inappropriate man. This other man and I were dating for a couple of weeks. When I found out he was married, I broke it off (albeit a little later than I should have). Even after repeatedly being VERY CLEAR to him, that I no longer wanted to see him or have any contact with him, he would still call me non-stop for hours and hours. This happened every 3-4 months, and it kept me in a constant state of fear. Would he come seek me out? He knew where I lived at the time. After a year and a half of ignoring his sporadic call-frencies I finally changed my number. I felt defeated. Why must it be my burden to bear that these men have problems? Why am I the one who has to feel shitty, be genuinely scared, when I am not the one who is wrong? Why do I have to carry these men’s wrongdoings around with me? I am in a constant state of self-consciousness because of guys who act inappropriately: When I go out once in a while, I always make sure not to dress in a flattering way, so that I can mitigate the excessive amount of cat calls and but-groping. When I go to work, I am ashamed of myself for dressing nicely when colleagues ask why I am so dressed-up, just because I wore a skirt and mascara. It makes me feel uncomfortable that men are keeping an eye on me like that. Stop being inappropriate, guys, and be as nice as we all know you really can be! "
"I worked tech support for 2 years in college, and when I wasn’t working phones, I was working the desk. It was set up in our university library, so any student/faculty visiting the library could get face-to-face support. One afternoon I was working alongside a male colleague; we were both the same age, etc. A male student approached the front of the queue (which was empty). Both my male colleague and I looked up. The person looked at me, looked at my colleague, and didn’t really know who to approach. To be fair, one of us should have said “I can help you” or something, but we didn’t and just waited to see who he would approach. After a second or two, the student stuttered out sheepishly, “uhh I think he can help me better” and went to my male colleague. At the time I was kind of relieved that I didn’t have to help him, so I could keep working on my homework. But his comment still stuck with me. Why was my male colleague able to help him better? And I know the student wasn’t being mean about it, that was just his off-guard response. "

"Today was my 20 week scan and my husband and I found out we were having a boy and he says healthy. Feeling elated I went on to work looking forward to a team meeting with our new boss. During the meeting, after finding out I was pregnant, he asked in front of everyone whether I was planning to return after my maternity leave. Feeling embarrassed, I immediately mumbled ‘of course!’ – although I have no idea what the plan is yet. After the meeting, during which the boss encouraged us to volunteer for new projects, I expressed interest in one. His reaction was to look towards my ‘bump’ and say ‘you shouldn’t have been so irresponsible then’. I am so disappointed – it’s 2016 but attitudes to pregnancy in the workplace are still medieval. "
"I was the Script Supervisor on a feature film – a key, above the line, irreplaceable role. I worked side-by-side with the Director, and every time he called me “darlin” in front of the cast and crew, I called him “darlin” right back. On the day he said he didn’t MEAN any offense, I told him he was hurting me nonetheless. He cut it out for a few days. Then at the wrap party he did it AGAIN. He seemed to think his right to be sexist trumped the damage he was doing to my authority on set. He was totally ignorant of how his microaggressions contribute to the difficulty I have, and apparently WILL have, securing equal pay. Tl;dr If someone says “Don’t call me ‘darlin’,” RESPECT THEM and STOP. "
"My workplace is one of the few where women suceed quite often and the most powerful positions are held mostly by women, who are just incredible. However. We have our technical support department that is still very much a ‘boys club’. I have recently been promoted and I work overseeing several teams from this department. My first week I covered the front desk so our security guard could take lunch. This was before I had introduced myself to my new agents. One of my agents came in with a non-functioning badge. I informed him I would need to alert his sup to come downstairs and escort him in. He went off. This is company policy, no badge or no working badge, you need your sup to let you in, it was not news to him. He was so offended I would not break policy for him because I am young and female. He expected me to do as he told me? Later on when I introduced myself to the team he refused to look me in the eye. Hopefully ashamed of his embarrassing fit. "
"I am a cleaner at a construction site. There are only a handful of women working here and am surrounded by hundreds of men every day. I am a victim of sexism every day. Most of the time I keep my mouth shut and ignore it, but this morning two of the men were talking about a woman who works in the offices. The stuff they were saying was extremely vulgar, it made me sick to my stomach. So I stepped in and defended her. They preceded to call me stuck up and a feminazi and that I need to lighten up (those being the nicest of the comments). Word spread throughout the site and I am now hiding in the storage cupboard seriously considering quitting my job because I’ve not gone ten minutes today without someone calling me a name or telling me to make my life easier by just shutting up and keeping my opinions to myself.

"Every time I drive with a male passenger, he doubts my competence and assumes I need his help, instructions or comments on all the things I’m apparently always nearly crashing into or doing wrong. I am a good driver and have driven for 18 years without an accident or as much as a scratch, I follow traffic rules and don’t cause damage to my car. There is no reason to have a problem with my driving, but every man feels the need to diminish my driving skills to elevate his own, just because of the inaccurate stereotypes that women can’t drive and men are superior drivers. "
"I hear a lot of sexist things in the work place. I wanted to list them here. I was once told by a male banker that he shouldn’t have to take paternity leave because women are naturally better at looking after children. Another male executive of a company asked another woman in front of me how old she was (she was 34) and that she should think about getting married and having children. And a female colleague of mine was asked in all seriousness by her male client after a series of late nights, how her children were being looked after while she worked so late. Anyone who thinks that women have equality in the work place is blind. "
When I was at school (so aged 12-15) there were two grown men who would sit on a bench and wait for all of us schoolgirls to walk past. They would whistle at the youngest looking ones and pat their laps. Like when you want pets to sit on you. They were doing this outside of their workplace (a local restaraunt) in full view and nobody complained.

"This is minor but when even the bbc, who are a publicly funded TV channel in the UK constantly calls female athletes at the olympics girls, it shows how some men automatically belittle women. They don’t even realise how insulting calling full grown women ‘girl’ is. I’ve challenged men in various jobs in the past when they have used ‘girl’ to refer to me or ‘girls’ for teams I have worked in that are mainly female. In one job I had if you listened to the senior staff, who just happened to be all men, our team must have been called ‘the girls’ the amount it was used, also the male member in our team of 4 was clearly not part of the team, so we did well constantly operating with just 75% of the required staffing levels at all times. What really annoyed me was when a younger woman who was part of the team tried calling us all ‘girls’, she got reminded even the junior member of the team was technically an adult at 18 years old, after that she didn’t use ‘girls’ within my earshot. I am glad to say in my experience the use of ‘girl/girls’ in the workplace seems to mainly be by men 40 plus, or if a younger male does use it my quick rebuke stays with them. Sadly though many women even those older than me are afraid to pull men up on this or have given up trying to get men younger than themselves to treat them with a basic level of respect. "
"First email received of the day (sent to myself + several men) says “Morning Guys”, not a good start to the day, made me feel ignored/irrelevent. Despite the sender working for a company with a 30 page diversity & inclusion policy, he says it every few minutes. Language matters. I’m not a bloke! Noone used to call me this. It’s become a horrible and lazy habit with some people. "
"Sorry this post is kind of long for what it is but just hear me out. So, I’ve been working a retail job for the summer and there’s this much older man who also works at the same store as me and ever since he introduced himself to me something about him made me uncomfortable. Even though I work at a large department store, he always seems to run into me when I’m alone somewhere and just the way he talks to me I can tell he is trying to flirt with me and he seems overly interested in my every move and what department I am working in that day etc. Anyways, today I was going on a break and of course I ran into him alone in the coat room and he started asking me a bunch of questions about where I go to school and other personal things and then he asked if I was planning to work during the school year and I said yes and he replied: “That’s good, yes I want you to stay around, you are very pleasing to look at and you are good for customer service.” And then he repeated himself saying something similar like “Yes, your face is good for the customers to see, you know good for customer service.” So yeah pretty creepy and uncomfortable especially because we were alone and his comments made me feel super objectified as if the only reason I was good for working there is because of my appearance.

I even have to reassure myself by asking him regularly if he thinks I’m being a bridezilla, or if I’m coming off too “angry” for a female. "
"My boyfriend has been working in a food environment for over a month now and has a beard. Nothing has ever been said to him about it as it’s tidy and kept short. However, today his manager is on holiday and so he has a temporary replacement manager. 15 minutes into his shift I get a call from my boyfriend saying that his (temporary) manager has told him to go home and shave, not just trim, but completely remove the beard he’s had for several year. Never before this day has anyone voiced a problem with him having facial hair. He hasn’t been offered a beard net, nor was he called prior to his shift to inform him there was an issue. If women have long hair in a food environment they’re told to put it up and wear a net. How you look is part of your identity, my boyfriend’s choice to have a beard shouldn’t be taken away because of where he works. He would have been perfectly happy to wear a beard net. Instead he now looks unrecognisable and has already stated he now hates how he looks. You wouldn’t ask a woman to cut her hair for work, instead of wearing a hair net, so why ask a man to shave his beard. The manager also sent home every other male on shift to change their appearance, despite him having a beard (and not wearing a net) himself. "
"Students that are in the 6th grade have the gall to make comments on about how they hate women, girls suck as sports, and things such as that. I have seen an 8th grader attempting to kiss a girl who did not want to be kissed. I so wish I could have done something about that but ugh, my fear got in my way. At my old school, I was called a slut and a whore for being the only girl in a certain group of guys. On the media, there was this guy who said that all women are cunts, called me and many other women a ‘bitch, cunt,etc.’ and things like that and i actually confronted him and the only way he shut up, was because, I brought my boyfriend into it( My bf was pissed at the guy. and disgusted too. but we both had fun making fun of that misogynist guy) and HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT TRUMP SAYS ABOUT WOMEN Seriously MY personal experience was a guy attempting to kiss me on the lips. Multiple times. at first I thought he was playing around and I told him that if he ever wanted to surprise a lady, you have to sneak up on her( thought it would be good advice if he ever wants to like be romantic with his future gf) and he did it to me. TO ME. I swear he kissed my cheek, 3-4 times. And before I got off the bus, he told me ‘ just one kiss’ and i replied with ‘I’m crushing’ and UGH…..it makes me too mad to say.. At a workplace, not mine, it was in the pool(technically still a work place, just not mine). These group of 14-17 year old guys, were making fun of, filming, and bothering this female lifeguard. One of my friends, female, tried to stop a guy that was filming and bopped him on the head and snatching the phone away. And mind this, she was 13. he was at least older than her by 2-3 years. And it’s pretty much known that males are, at least, most( probably over 50%) are stronger than women. And this guy was older than her. And he pushed her into the pool. OR at least attempted to. it was at 3 ft Very shallow, he could have pushed her, over the edge and make her have a serious back or head injury. She could have died. And it was a jolly good thing she was not hurt, right? Oh, she wasn’t hurt physically, she was scared for her life, or emotionally hurt. And I know this for a fact, that, if the lifeguard was a male, that group of guys would have listened to the lifeguard. The lifeguard was a woman and the guys tried to harass her about that. but if the lifeguard was a male then they would have been like little obedient dogs. "
"I work for a small science-based nonprofit; 4 full-time technical staff and one part-time administrative manager. All of the full-time staff have a minimum of a Master’s degree in science and we are considered highly knowledgeable in our fields. All of us are female. When one of my co-workers left earlier in the year, we drafted a position posting and sent it to our Executive Committee for board review. One of the comments we received on the draft was “looks good. So are you going to hire a guy this time around?” We posted the position and I received several comments from colleagues first saying they were glad we were posting, and then saying “will you be hiring a guy?” One straight-out said “you know what you should do, you should hire a guy into the office.” I am concerned that they imply our office will not be improved by the hiring of a competent individual regardless of gender identity, but that it needs specifically a male. Also I sincerely doubt these comments would be made if the script were flipped. I have taken to reminding them “We did hire some gentlemen a few years ago. They seemed to have trouble hacking it.” "
"There are two parts to my everyday sexism story. I began working as a waitress in a hotel last week as a summer job. Since it was my first real job, we (my family and boyfriend) were all really excited. Sitting around my kitchen table one evening over dinner, we were discussing the job. Then my mother said something about the possibility of “men trying to feel (me) up” while on the job. It was the way she said it (so normally as if it was inevitable that every woman will have to put up with this type of casual assault in her lifetime) that made me feel uneasy. To make matters worse, neither my sisters, dad or boyfriend objected. It was like they were acknowledging a fact. I should have said something but I couldn’t find the words. The second part happened while in work. I was about to lift a heavy(ish) try of glasses when a male co-worker insisted that he carry it. I asked him why, are they likely to fall off? (The glasses were very tall and like I said, I just began waitressing so I wasn’t yet confident in the skill. Also, I didn’t want to smash anything on my first week working). He blatently replied: “No, they’re too heavy. I’m a man, I can carry this stuff.” When I told him he was being sexist, he went on about men’s natural stregnth being more than women’s. Not only was he patronising, but he honestly believed by belittling me he was helping me. I know chivalry is one thing, but telling someone (man or woman, black or white, etc.,) that you are stronger than they is wrong. I felt humiliated. I wanted to fight back and tell him strength depends on a number of other factors, but something inside held me back. A voice that said, “you don’t want your other co-workers thinking you’re a psycho” so I didn’t argue back. I didn’t use my voice because I was afraid of what people would think. I’m so angry at myself. Worse again, when I told my parents the story they couldn’t understand why I was so upset… I had two opportunities to speak out but I didn’t because (1) I wasn’t confident (2) I wasn’t trained to put up with sexism when I was younger. What makes me angry is that we shouldn’t have to learn to put up with it but to address it and solve the problem. That’s why I’m so happy I found this site! "
"I was recently getting into a black cab in London after a client meeting. As there were 5 of us it was a bit of a squeeze. As my last colleague, who was female, got in, our male boss said “oh better make room for XX’s thighs!” And everyone laughed as she got in, looking mortified. "
"On my lunch break, walking across the road from my work to the shops and get wolf whistled at. I ignore it and hear someone say ‘bitch’. Can’t see where they are and think maybe they were in a parked car. When I’m coming back from my lunch i consider walking a different (and longer) way in case they’re still there, but tell myself I’m being silly… Sure enough walking back across the road am wolf-whistled at again. And again when I just ignore it and carry on walking I hear a man say ‘stuck up bitch.’ Seriously what do these men expect to happen? That they whistle at you like you’re a dog and you run over and be glad for the attention? I don’t get it! "
"I have worked in a popular Asian chain restaurant for about 8 years. About six months or so into my employment I was serving a table of five lads, and at a loss as to what to do with the chopsticks provided one guy used them to demonstrate to the rest of the table how I had disappointingly small breasts by poking my left breast multiple times. As the table erupted in laughter I left and informed a male supervisor of what had happened, he smiled and shrugged at me and refused to either kick the customers out or take over the table for me. I had to go back to these men and finish taking the order, which I did whilst visibly shaking. After the event I was pulled aside by the General Manager and asked if I understood why the supervisor had done nothing. He informed me that due to the fact that we were a new restaurant and the financial crisis had just struck we needed to keep all the customers we had happy. "

He blatantly only addresses this at me and not at the other people there, all male. I have a master’s degree in engineering and won awards for chemistry as a teenager. But I have a vagina so that means I am unfamiliar with bloody middle school-level physics. I bet this f*cker wouldn’t be able to draw a diagram of a galvanic cell if you put one in front of him. "
"i work in real estate, in a holiday destination. I deal with sexism all the time, usually indirect comments to my colleagues which happened just the other day, “why don’t you get this dollybird here to get in a bikini and pose by the pool, that will get the punters in”. He didn’t stop pestering me the whole time he was being dealt with by my colleague, i stayed polite. Today was the worst. Today an old Irish guy came in with his, i guess, grandson. The grandson was probably 13 & being very upfront, grandfather seemed rather out of it but not drunk..so it was hard to figure out what kind of property they were looking for. Young boy kept chipping in and giving me direct looks..as i was showing them some options on the computer i could see he was fiddling with his boardshorts but then, his hand went down his front and…was blatantly wanking and staring straight at me. When i looked over at him he stopped immediately. Unless this happens to you it probably sounds so funny, but i just could not believe that his grandfather didn’t even twig at all that this was going on and was so reviled by it, did they come into the office especially to harass me? I might as well be some kind of computer myself sometimes..people assume you are not real, that they can do or say anything to you because they are on holiday. My main horror afterwards was that there was some sort of social shift i had not been aware of. That this young guy thought it was possible to do that, that it was ok. That other people would tell me i was being overdramatic. And of course, shame and annoyance with myself that i could not tell them to get lost. I keep saying to myself “that won’t happen to me again” and yet there always is. Respect isn’t hard won, it’s just not there to start with. "

"One day whilst having dinner with my godfather, he starts to complain about how he lost a potential job. My godfather is a director and a good one too, however sadly he is a sore loser. He said that the female producers hired a woman over him because they were women. He refused to accept that perhaps this female director was just simply better and started complaining about the increase of women in his work place and the unfair bias, despite the fact that it has only risen to 30%. Never before have I been so disgusted with my godfather. "
"When I was working for the Harvester, a couple of years ago, I was cleaning tables outside and a guy came up to me and said “I was gonna touch your arse but I’ll just think about it whilst wanking later”. When I told my manager, she said “he says it to all the young girls. I’m not going to bar him because he’s one of our regulars, just ignore it”. I didn’t post this at the time because my ex boyfriend was so anti the feminist movement. "
"At work, I’ve noticed that if a woman declines the offer of a sweet/sugary snack, she will ALWAYS be asked “are you watching your weight/on a diet?”. Always. I’m always asked that question and, as of late, I always give the same reply “No, it’s because of the same reason I declined last time you asked; I’m vegan and what you’re offering is not”. Since switching to vegan, I’ve had to use this response many, MANY times because apparently I’m not listened to the first few times! When my male co-workers decline a sweet snack, they’re not questioned at all. "
I heard a man on the street remark “Everything has gone to shit since they allowed women in the workplace.” 
"I’m recovering from surgery, and as part of this I have to do physiotherapy in my office. It’s not an open layout, but I’m on a hallway of predominantly men. The office door has a bit window and a pull down visor that doesn’t work. It’s already awkward and painful to do this physio whilst at work, without a male colleague commenting frequently on ‘what a nice stretch that was’ or ‘I missed your legs when I walked past today’. I tried to find a new place to do the medically advised stretches but there wasn’t one. I now don’t do physio in my closed office because I don’t want this to happen. When I approached my male colleague he asked why I can’t take a joke and told me he can’t help but flirt. Need I say more? "
"I recently posted about a man-child I work with. This same manchild was working with me the other day when some tourists came into our shop. As he was passing one, an English woman, he leaned in too close to her and said “you have blue eyes”. She looked backed at him and laughed nervously as he finished “I don’t like blue eyes” and then fixed her with a triumphant smirk as he walked away. The insinuation was clear: “I’ve decided you don’t meet my approval, what are you going to do to fix that since your existence is meaningless without my approval?”. Moments later she and her friend gathered around my kassa to ask me if I’d witnessed what just happened. I was honest; I told her that he’s always like that and our bosses choose to ignore his behaviour.0 Yesterday, this manchild was downright abusie to me at work, going so far as to lie to my boss about non-existent incompetence on my part. He did barked chastisement at me for not asking if he wanted coffee. THEN, another co-worker of mine was passing by and said “so. . . manbaby said you’ve been giving him the finger for no reason!”. Upon seeing the very confused look on my face, he finished with “Yeah. . . just thought you should know about it”. While this guy has always had a bad attitude, his outright lies about me are new and have me fearing for my job, since I don’t know if my bosses have disregarded what he’s said or are taking it as truth. "
"Preventative advice welcome. I’m male and in my 50s and my business partner is female and in her 30s. We buy houses and refurbish them. Even when my partner employs contractors to work on the properties they still refer to me as ‘Gaffer’, ‘Your Boss’ etc when talking to her. I thought of suggesting she writes BOSS on her hard hat or something, but we’re partners, so not really appropriate. Suggestions welcome. "
"I have been touched, verbally harassed, followed, kissed, I was shown private parts, once someone was masturbating behind my back while I was waiting for the bus. I don’t feel comfortable wearing the clothes that I want to avoid standing out. I always sit strategically on the bus or train. Every time I go outside I am constantly assessing danger or not danger zones, every man who stops to talk to me is first considered a threat. Last time I was groped at the Tube station I was on my way to the gym. When I was telling people about that experience two things stood out to me. “What were you wearing?” and “Why this thing never happens to me?” "
"I was so excited! I found a job vacancy that I ticked all the boxes for! I had more than enough of the required experience, skills etc. for this VERY specific job vacancy! I painstakingly wrote my cover letter and arranged my CV perfectly and applied with a song in my heart aaaaaaaaaaaand… REJECTION! This would be fine, people get rejected. Except for one thing; the reason they gave for rejecting my application. “We found candidates who matched the vacancy requirements in full”. Perfectly reasonable and acceptable reason, if you ignore the fact that I also matched every one of the vacancy requirements mentioned. By their own logic, I at least merited an interview. I can’t be certain that this is the result of sexism, but I’ve heard too many stories and even read too many actual studies which prove that, even in 2016, just having an obviously female name attached to your CV is all some employers need to either click delete or toss your CV in the garbage. "
"Another job interview for which I was overqualified. This time however they did not assume I did not finish my phd studies but gave me compliments on the great achievement of finishing this. However, the last questions on the interview were all about my personal life; asking about my parents, my partner, if I had children and if I wanted children. I was flabbergasted and shocked. This organisation is a highly renowned large health institution. It makes me so sad that is is so hard for me to belong somewhere and use the skills that I worked hard for and gave up many things (family) for. I wonder if I would have been better off (both happier and richer) without my degrees and ambition. "
"When I was fifteen, I got my first part-time job, as a checker in a supermarket. One day, I served a local celebrity – a newscaster. She was there with an older gentleman, and they were buying parties supplies, which included quite a lot of alcohol. I apologised, and told them I wasn’t old enough to sell them alcohol, and could only do so with permission from my manager. The older gentleman leaned forward, leered at me, and asked, “But are you old enough to have a lover?” To this day, I have absolutely no idea what I was supposed to say. At the time I merely blushed beet-red and said nothing at all. The newscaster… laughed. "
"At age 20 I was massaged and felt up by my superior at work who I thought was trying to console me after a particularly stressful period at work. When I realized what was happening, and the feeling of dread which accompanied it, I was able to escape virtually unharmed. That said, my experience of various forms of male dominance and female subordination has manifested in each and every workplace I have worked in over the past 10 years. I work in a male dominated industry and society and sexism is prevalent. "
"A comment directed at me on a website discussing women in the workplace. That as a mother, who may never fully utilise her talents, “I am taking the place for a more deserving male who would make better use of it.” I then pointed out that as a student with a 6.74 GPA, two times on the Deans List, winner of an academic scholarship and other academic award, there were demonstrably no other *more deserving* people for my place in my degree. He then commented: “Well putting so much into your study you’re not much of a mother then are you.” "
"Going to a Christmas work party and having a (married) colleague, who had previously made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace, sitting next to me stick his hand up my skirt. "
"Since I get together with my boyfriend, some people started treat me like his property. It’s like they forgot my name, instead they call me his “gilt” (female pig), “ass”, “pussy”. They use his surname instead my name and my surname when they refer to me, we aren’t married. When I protest they say “it’s a joke”, “woman are called like this, get use to it”, “stop being femiNAZI”. They bully me, and when I point it out they bully me even more. Sometimes it makes me wanna cry. "
"At my workplace, people go out at lunchtime on their birthday and buy everyone a drink. On my 30th birthday a manager at the company (who is now a director) said to me, in front of my colleagues: “Ah you are 30 now – you will leave and have a baby – that’s what all women do” Clearly no career for me here and I’m working on my exit plan! "
"I interviewed yesterday for a job with a construction company. I am and engineering student and every other semester we get to work for 4 months. I was very qualified for this job and as I was interviewed I felt like like I was spending the entire interview defending myself rather than speaking about how I was qualified for the fob. “How would you deal with having to work in the field?” “How have your past experiences been with dealing with trades people?”” How do you feel about working 20 days on 8 off?” “How do you feel about having to live in a camp in the middle of nowhere?” “Why would you want to work a less technical position? That doesn’t seem like a very good idea.” After the interview I sat in my car thinking. I don’t think they would’ve asked a man half of those questions. I didn’t once get asked about my qualifications in relevance to the job. I left thinking there’s no chance I got that job. Not because I didn’t have good answers to all their questions, not because I wasn’t qualified but because I was a woman. I was interviewed by 3 men for a “Man’s job”. I don’t ever misinterpret things. I spoke to my dad who is a trades person about the situation and he replied “its not 1960, they can’t act like that.” I’m frustrated with society. I’m frustrated with the fact that I am questioning my own feelings to justify their actions. I am angry that a situation like this happened when I was warned that sometime in my career in a “mans” world this was going to happen to me. It’s not 1960 so why am I considering not reporting this incident? Why am I afraid no one will believe me? Because in some ways 2016 is no more advanced than 1960. "
"So, at work – in a supermarket – it’s pretty manual work. We work the warehouse which means pulling pallets [averaging about 250lb each] and lifting heavy objects etc. I’m one of the strongest people on the entire team despite my age, gender, and body type, and I can easily work twice as much as half of the other staff. A new guy started a few weeks ago, and last night was my first shift with him. And I was pulling out drinks – baring in mind this is the heaviest pallet, easily approaching 500lb and I’m not struggling anymore than usual, I mean anybody reasonably has to put their back in to it but I was making no complaint. The new guy hurries over to me and says ‘I’ll do that one, why don’t you do rolls? Little lady like you can’t be straining herself!’ in a completely well-meant way and I just glared at him and I think he got what I was saying but he went ahead anyway and this man – standing at about 6’1 and easily packing 250lb – CANNOT move this pallet that I have already moved 30 odd yards. He’s seriously trying to hide his struggle, and I’m just holding down laughter – not because he’s ‘weak’ for a man, but because he said I was ‘straining myself’ only a moment ago. I simply rolled my eyes and took it back from him to proceed with what I was doing, not saying a word, and this guy literally begs me not to say anything to the other guys and all I can think is – 1. Why is your masculinity so fragile? 2. Why would I go telling everyone this story like it hasn’t happened a million times before? I just nod at him, get on with my shift, and end up helping him out because he hasn’t even done his work for the night. It is one thing offering a woman help but firstly – you do not force your help upon said woman – and secondly – you make sure you are actually capable of doing the thing you are offering to. "
Top boss described his new PA starting on Monday as “A cute little thing” in our team meeting this week. 
"Getting tired and fed up of a male colleague’s comments. He walks up to me, smiles, tells me that I’m doing a woman’s job then tells me that I’ve “missed a bit”. His thoughtless behaviour is really starting to tick me off. A female work colleague laughs along with him and sees it all as a “joke”. When I tell her that I am not happy with his comments, she tells me to just laugh along well th him because he is “learning disabled” and “incapable of understanding”. When I was young, people used to think I was learning disabled too, but I don’t make rude comments to male colleagues. I try to be as friendly and polite as possible. Being “learning disabled” or others things shouldn’t be an excuse for sexism or rude behaviour. This is sad. I like to talk to work colleagues, but I now dread this man talking to me because I know he’ll pass comments on my work, my sex or my appearance. Also, I know that he isn’t living in a vacuum and is clearly aware enough to pick up gendered societal expectations of how some men view women and work. He says that my work is women’s work, but I know men and women who do the same tasks I do. How is tactlessly pointing out my sex when I am trying to work supposed to help anyone? Also, how is infantilising this man by writing off his ability to understand due to his disabilities supposed to help him improve to become a better more tactful person? Everyone can learn, why not him? Isn’t that basically failing him by assuming that he is “not capable enough to get it” when clearly clearly does understand that some men have certain views of women? If I report this man’s behaviour, will people think I’m ableist? "
"Leaving work the ither day, myself and my male colleague passed a hammock store. The shop has high quality, colourful hammocks and I’ve always wanted one since my living space allows for one now and they’re super comfortable. Upon expressing the sentiment of wanting a hammock, my colleague looked me up and down, got THE creepiest smile on his face and leered at me as he announced what a “dirty, dirty girl” I apparently am. Gross. "
"Seconds ago, my male work colleague came into the office and requested all the males in my office (individually, like we were being chosen for a sports team in school) to come and help them shift boxes as we move offices. I know- for a fact- that i can lift more than some of my male colleagues at the gym but It was just natural for only “the lads” to be chosen. When I raised the fact that I, and my peers, were overlooked i was greeted with: ” ohhhhhhhh take it up with HR!” "
"I am a white man. I commit sexist acts every day. I have been so trained by this society to objectify womens’ bodies that it takes constant effort to keep myself from doing it. After 10 years of awareness of my problem, I still struggle every day with this problem. I get pleasure from giving in to my training but I know it’s wrong and I feel terrible when I choose to do it. My sexist acts consist mostly of looking or staring. I never say anything or commit battery, those are things I’ve never done, but I have seen men do these things and have not intervened. I want to apologize to the women who are the object of this constant assault, including my own, and I discuss it as often as possible with my wife to see how I’m progressing. I figure I have 20 more years to live, hopefully I’ll eventually have a day or two without a sexist thought. "
"My two of my male co-workers often make remarks about wanting to kiss me. This makes be feel disgusting, but they won’t stop. Another co-worker, who is 4 years younger than me, is constantly complaining that my ass is huge and that he can’t move get past me or to reach something he needs because my huge ass apparently gets in the way. He says this in front of customers as well. Once, he was watching me work from across the street and took it upon himself to yell “You’ve a pretty big ass Tarry!”. I was mortified, but replied just as loudly “At least one of us has something that’s big!” while pointedly staring at his crotch. That instantly shut him up, which was really gratifying. It was great to give him a taste of his own medicine. In recent times however, he’s started drawing stupid caricatures of a stick figure woman with a huge ass, which is obviously meant to be me. He just draws them and then leaves them where he knows I’ll find them. It’s so demeaning, especially when he watches for me to find these drawings and then breaks down laughing at my reaction. This same man-child found my friend on Facebook when I said she was visiting. He wanted to see if she was “beautiful” and found her on FB without my knowledge. I became aware of his having located her when he started saying things like “Ooooh nevermind! This girl is NOT beautiful! Make sure that I don’t meet her when she comes!”, as if I had intended to introduce them! He’s constantly boasting about how he’s cheating on his girlfriend and that she has no idea. In the mornings, he openly chastises me for “talking too much and using too many words” and tells me that he doesn’t understand why I “can’t shut up”. He then starts with this annoying, high pitched voice which is obviously meant to be me. I tell him that it’s not my problem if he’s not intelligent enough to have a more extensive vocabulary so that he can understand all my “many words”. But he says all this in front of our bosses and everyone we work with and no one, apart from me, EVER reprimands him for this sexist behaviour. "
"I just had a man call me to ask my company to sponsor his professional investor event. He mentioned that they were going to try something new this year to improve the networking. They’re going to assign hostesses to each attendee to make introductions. “hostesses???” I said, incredulously. He replied, no lie, “yes…you know…good looking young ladies”. I said, ‘so you mean trolley dolley” He said “well…uh…I wouldn’t say that…I mean…you know…good looking young ladies” Utter disbelief. "
"I was 17 and took my 1st job. I started work as a telemarketer at an alarm company. Probably on my 2nd evening there, as we all left for the night, my 27 yr. old “boss” asked me to stay behind and chat for a while. We were completely alone. Throughout our lovely conversation, he asked me to come out with him and his friends down to Atlantic City& stay in the hotel with them. I thought this to be odd, as I was only 17,I wasn’t sure what the hell I could actually do there. No drinking or gambling for me. He then went on to ask me what kind of reputation I had at my high school. Was I ” a good girl” or a “slut who slept around with all the guys”. I recall feeling oddly uncomfortable, and wishing I could run out of that desolate office and out to my car. I thought about how I could get outside should I need to run and escape for my safety. Somehow the conversation ended and I was able to leave without incident. I went home to find my boyfriend and friends at my house waiting for me. I recall feeling embarrassed, as though what I had just encountered was brought on by something I had done. All I said to them all was “I think my boss likes me” and i sort of laughed it off. As a mom now to 3 young daughters, I am frightened by the entire incident. How could I have downplayed it all. Did I really think that this guy just “liked” me. He was 10 years my senior, I wasn’t even a legal adult… and as my boss, I thought this type of conversation was normal?! I never told my parents. Somewhere deep down I knew this was not right. I somehow thought I did something to bring on that type of behavior. I was smart enough to quit a few days later. However I was dumb enough to not call this jerk out on his sexual harassment. "
"For the 2nd time in 2 weeks, I heard a neighbor discuss the attire of a 14 yr. old girls dress at our local town fair. The 1st comment, from a 39 yr old man, was that she was in the shortest shorts and stomach baring top. She had a broken ankle, and the cast went from ankle to mid thigh. He commented he couldn’t get over that her mother let her out like that. My only question to him after he described the length of her shorts and barness of her tank top.. “wow. Was it hot out? ” That particular week it was consistently over 90Â° each day. Today, a mom in the neighborhood mentioned how she saw the girl at the fair and said she was wearing a “hoochie momma top”. Why must we sexualize the way a 14 yr old dresses? She’s stick thin with no curves…basically built like a boy of her age. could you imagine she actually had some breasts and butt and other womanly curves? She’d be chastised even more so. "
"One of my mums friends is around 50ish and is stuck in his sexist ways. Whilst on holiday with him, we went walking which meant me walking quite far ahead as I have quite long legs and a big stride. I managed to catch him saying to his friend, “she’ll never end up getting married, he’ll never be able to catch her!” I wasn’t quite sure what I’d heard but what right does he have to assume I’ll get married? Another time, I was helping out at the hotel pool by vacuuming the dirt and leaves out of the water. After around 20 minutes, he said “you’ll make a good wife one day with all that hoovering!” I turned around to say something but didn’t in the end. The most recent sexist comment was when my friend, who is a boy, was talking about new cars. After stating that I didn’t really mind what car my family had, he proceeded to comment, ” that’s right though, ladies don’t really like cars”.” "
"One day I pulled and parallel parked outside the shop where I work. A male customer inside, who I had parked infront of remarked “That was a good bit of parking.” While this is an example of casual sexism, and nowhere near as extreme as many of the stories on here, it strikes me as a good example though of how men can often be sexist without even realising it. After the customer had gone I said to my male boss what a stupid sexist remark I thought the man had made, but my boss, who I’m pretty sure considers himself a feminist, thought I was over reacting, even when I pointed out to him that the remark would not have been made if I was a man. A few weeks later I walked in to hear the same customer telling my boss that he had seen the new Ghost busters movie, but it was “too feminazi” for his taste! "
"One time, I was sitting in my office with my boss and a coworker (both male). My boss asked if I had ever been donkey punched and laughed. My coworker and I were shocked. I’ve built up an catalog of incidents like this over the last few years. "
"I work at a jail and we often have to respond to a situation in the garage where new arrestees are brought in. I was the only female who responded and as we were walking through the double doors one of my male co-workers looked at me and said, “What are you doing here?” I gave him A cold look mixed with disgust and said, “My job.” I hate that I have to experience things like that period, however especially in a field where working as a team could be the difference between life and death. "
"I have recently finished training at a placement but what a time to have gone through as there were a lot of unpleasant stuff happening around. Not only did I had to put up with the unpredictable timetable with the manager, there were many admiration from male volunteers at the head office where I report back every week. If I had to choose between challenge at placement or head office, I rather have the former because there is control that I can improve things. But the latter was quite frightening and intimidating as some men came from various different background, particularly one man had a criminal past as a gangster. At first he commented me that I reminded him of his daughter but as time passed, his intentions became a bit more different. He even called me intimate names in front of his friends. He kept showing me pictures from his mobile of his previous partners, girlfriends, friends, children, etc. I did not wanted to be rude so had to be polite whenever he was around just in case he could get angry at me. It wasn’t just him but some of his friends took interest in me, asking about my personal life, whether I can have open relationships with men outside marriage, and so on. As I was single and childless, most thought I can be with anyone I like and even asked me for a date with them. There were a lot of suggestions about the subject of sex. One was even curious about why I don’t have it and I was embarrassed about these intimate questions. I underestimated some of these men as they were very experienced in relationships with women and a few have tried to get me to be their girlfriend, saying that I am naughty, commented about my looks which made me sound like a former topless model. With all these harassment going on, I could have reported to the management but there were a lot of strict rules in complaining too much. I already complained about the timetable and finally had it sorted out. But I was too frightened to say about anything of them in case I may get sacked. In the past, I did use to think of myself for being too much brawn and not enough brains, including some feeling of awkwardness surrounding the attention of men. Now in my middle age, it is a compliment to have the opposite gender take interest in me, but when it gets too much, it can be harassing when the environment are mostly men. I thought that the 21st century have made women stronger but some men are still looking at us like objects. In future, I believe women need more support and advice on how to deal with men in challenging situations even though we have made progress in the equality movement since the early 20th century. "
"At lunch today someone said that marrying a certain type of female, of which his ex was one, would decrease your life expectancy. He went on to say that your suicide rate would go up, and thickness of your wallet would decrease. All the other guys at the table laughed and this went on for a few minutes. When I flipped out, one of my coworkers explained that this group of women is always made fun of, because people from that region looks down on everyone else in China, so it’s ok. He used the term “under the table political correctness”. "
I work with mainly women colleagues – we have only two or three men working with us and only one of them is under 30! This colleague is usually asked by managers (women) to do any jobs that involve lifting because ‘he is a man’ (not that this is said out loud but it is obviously the reason). The other day on his rota he was down to see a certain manager. We joked that this would be to lift something heavy. When I saw him afterwards and asked what he had to see her about it turned out we had been completely correct when we had joked about it. He’s pretty easy-going so I don’t think he’d say anything about it but his job description is not box-lifter and it seems unfair for him to be stereotyped in this way. Women are just as capable of lifting things as men are. I’ve been thinking about it more and more and if it happens again I think I’ll say something to the manager or at least check if its making him uncomfortable. Sexism goes both ways. 
Fortunately I have not been subjected to sexism in the past 20 years. However I was subjected to sexism at my workplace in the 90’s. I overheard my boss tell my co-manager that I had to work a little harder than she did because I was not blonde and cute. Looking back I wish I had gone to HR immediately and called him on it. It makes me very angry that sexism still is tolerated in the world. 
"I remember being objectified as a woman as long as the boys noticed I didn’t just add ‘pointless’ tidbits to classes but I also had breasts. I remember in primary school the confusion when I argued with boys, even if I didn’t get it. I remember hitting puberty at school and being openly groped by a boy in my year at 14+ everyday at lunch with both hands and as a reflex laughing it off and feeling as if it was a compliment. I remember being harassed throughout chemistry about whether I ‘shaved’ or not. I wish now I had learned to make a fuss, not to just be complacent. I always believed myself to be a strong woman as I was always raised but as long as I just didn’t stand out too much. When I got my first boyfriend at 17 I remember being picked apart ’til I I felt there was nothing left, being called ‘unattractive’ in the shower and asked to lose weight. When I once plucked up the courage to tell him I thought he should get more muscle-y his response was simply ‘no’. I also remember the two times he raped me and how he apologised but did it again. I remember how it took over a year to come to the conclusion it was rape, because we were in a relationship and I guess these things just happened. I remember at 20 when my boss continually harassed me by text and after many rejections told me I ‘deserved to be in (his) pants’. I also remember how he stood in the way of another guy I liked, how he wouldn’t come near me because even though he appeared to be disgusted by his behaviour explained to me quite plainly it was kinda like a guy code. And I still don’t know by which of these two men I was offended more by. But I can say this. As a 21 year old woman I am loud, I speak out, I tell men and woman who are sexist exactly why their behaviour is wrong, I am sarcastic and I am confident. Because of projects like this I know I am not alone, that I do not deserve this and this behaviour is not normal. I now openly tell people my boss is a sexist prat that doesn’t have two brain cells to rub together and have managed discuss with friends the verbal abuse I suffered under my ex boyfriend and utter to even a few the categorical rape I have suffered. Because no this is not normal and no this is not okay. "
"There’s this guy in my high school who says very openly that he is depressed. He also groupes a lot of the girls in my grade, and make us feel very uncomfortable. He puts his arms around our waists, squeezes us, “massages” our shoulders, “tickles” us and “accidentally” brushes up against our chests. We can’t say anything because he’s “depressed” and he “doesn’t mean it in the wrong way” and we should be more considerate. I don’t know what to do. I hate it. I don’t want to say anything and then be responsible if he does something to himself. "
"I work in a small, privately owned company. After being in senior position, I was promoted to the position of “director” – basically heading our team of professionals, negotiating with clients, being the face of the company in local news. Still, when the owners (male) come into the office, they will shake hands with my male colleagues, not with me, not with any of my female colleagues. Being fed up with it, one time I gently pointed this out to one of them – how it undermines my position and causes discomfort for all females in the office. His response: but I cannot offer to shake hands with a lady, I wasn’t raised that way! "
"I work in an electrical shop and the boss in in his late 70s. I have worked there for a little while and until recently I was called ‘girl’ but we have progressed to my name being learnt. Very recently I was serving a customer, a nice older man, and I made a small mistake. I corrected it no problem however imy boss happened to have walked by. Upon learning of my mistake,my boss said: “shall we smack her bottom? You can smack one side and I will Smack the other.” The other man was embarrassed and I was mortified. We (the women) also can only wear dresses or skirts. You couldn’t make it up. G. "
"At a Christmas party, a guy I work with sexually harrassed me in front of my kid and his almost teenage sons. He talked about wanting to grab my ass. A male colleague, who I was sharing a cab with, joked that he could grab his. Then, as we were out the door, this man kept telling his older son to hug me, saying ‘Give her a hug! I can’t, but you can. Trust me, you’ll really enjoy it.’ I never said anything to work about it. I suppose like many women, I accepted my discomfort and annoyance instead of rocking the boat at work, and making a mark of myself. Of falling out with his wife, whom we also work with. I shouldn’t have. Now I see him almost everyday. I’ve barely spoken to him since, and I cringe when he enters the room. "
"I was up a ladder and my (gay) manager asked me what I would do if he looked up my skirt (I was wearing chef whites) as a joke, I didn’t find it funny so I replied that I’d report him to the police for sexual harassment in the workplace. He then laughed and mocked me for my reply. "

I hate feeling constantly scared outside and in my own home I hate that I can hardly out in words the things that happen because i immediately start questioning myself and wondering whether I was asking for it and knowing that if I said it to anyone in my family the first thing they will try to do is figure out how it could have been my fault 
"I am 20, unmarried, and pursuing a career in an unbelievably male-dominated field. I deal with sexists remarks, jokes, and expectations from my male peers on a daily basis. Some of them assume I’m incompetent simply because I’m female. Others feel threatened by my presence and try to make me feel like I’m incapable of understanding science and technology because I’m a woman. In reality, I have always LOVED science and was encouraged by my friends and family to pursue what I love. I came home to visit my parents recently, and they had some friends over for dinner. A male guest, upon learning that I had been a vegetarian for 10 years, said to me, “Well, what are you going to do when your husband tells you to make him roast beef?” This guy was serious. He seemed to think that I would, by default, give up my career, become a submissive housewife to a misogynist, and disregard my personal values to serve a husband who does not respect that I’m my own person. He also assumed that I’m heterosexual. Ha. Ha. Ha. "
"I work as a support worker in supported housing for homeless young people (where many are particularly vulnerable). During handover (where myself and another male support worker take over from the night staff) the male night worker says to the male support worker ‘room 4 needs a good clean and a hoover – but the woman can do that’ gesturing towards me, although not acknowledging me. This was not said as a joke. I was in too much shock to say anything but it made me feel really stupid. When I reported it a week later I got asked loads of questions by HR such as ‘are you sure he wasn’t just joking?’ and then they ended up just telling him that I had reported him. Afterwards it got so uncomfortable that I just ended up quitting because of the stress.. "

"Ms. Bates: I was at the Torrance Library in California USA – and viewed your book on the shelf – although I left it for others, I found it remarkable, that common everyday behaviors, can not be what we expect. On the hinge of elected Hillary here instead of her opposite, I applaud your effort. As a male, and an older one, I do hope I will not be admonished for holding open doors for: others following, old people, people with disabilities, and yes, even women – should I be able to determine if no offense will be registered. I intend to follow up with your book at a latter time. Really – it is the kind of thing that people need to be aware of.Thank-you. "
"Have decided to get a cleaner in for a couple of hours a week. Not because I’m so busy that I can’t do it myself. Not because I work full time or have young kids or both. Not because I’m old or infirm. Simply because I don’t like hoovering and dusting. And I can afford it. But it’s a funny thing – people seem to think that I ‘ought’ to do the hoovering and dusting myself. That somehow, because I work from home and am physically capable, it is my God-given duty as a woman to hoover and dust. I don’t get the same reaction if I mention that I pay someone to clean the windows, or wash my car, or dye my hair (all things I’m capable of doing for myself). Why is this? I had a bit of an epiphany the other day – realised that all these years when I’ve been doing it myself (reluctantly and therefore infrequently) I’ve been depriving someone else (probably but not necessarily another woman) of a source of income. And as I said, I can afford it – I’m a higher rate tax payer, I can afford Â£25 a week!!! Interestingly, the evening before she comes, my husband will tidy his stuff away without being asked. Tended not to do that for me, even when asked/pleaded with. That’s a whole other post!!! "

"I work in video games and one of my co-workers did an analysis of the mobile game Kim Kardashian. He was discussing it with me and he said he had a hard time explaining to our Japanese office why Kim K is famous. I didn’t understand what he meant and he clarified “because of the sex video.” When I think of why Kim K is famous, that is not what I think of, especially all of her female fans (I think of her show, fashionista etc). I later found out that his analysis is basically that people who pay into that game are victims who are tricked into doing so. That they are basically too stupid to know what they are doing. I argued that people like it because the storyline and customization is a perfect fit for the audience. They pay because they want to.. Not tricked. He said “yeah maybe…” And that was it. This same guy would always man-terrupt me in meetings. People would ask me a question and he would answer before me. Another guy actually noticed it and told me he notices he does that. At one point they thought of re-organizing me to be on the team, I shouted so hard the COO took me to lunch. I told him about both of the incidences above. Nothing happened. They promoted him the same day they promoted me. What else can we do if we raise the issue and yet nothing happens? "

I am working in Taiwan for a year and another foreign guy at the school I work at repeatedly tells the Taiwanese female coworkers how sexy he thinks they are in their little outfits. They wear casual clothes to work. A few of them have talked to me about how uncomfortable it makes them and ask if this is how all foreign men are. I mentioned to him that those types of comments are most definitely not work appropriate and was told I was just jealous that no one was saying them to me. Apparently sexual harassment in the workplace is ok as long as you are in a foreign country?????

The next day he came up to me and showed me a picture of him looking friendly with his arm around a white woman. He says, “See? I’m not creepy, Rachel.” I just said OK and walked away.

It was only after I was out of the room I released he was another deligate not an organiser or a staff member for the group.

It’s almost like this excuses the behaviour of a grown man at a professional gathering.

Each man in the course got his name announced by itself, along with a few words about what he had accomplished in the program. When it came time to announce my name, I was shocked that she called both of us women in the program up at the same time and recognized us together as being “the ladies in the program.” Nothing about our accomplishments, no individual recognition — just the fact that we were women. The program was a lot of extra work outside of our normal duties, and it hurt to not be recognized for my accomplishments, but only acknowledged for being a woman who made it through. The HR person who did this was also a woman. "

"This isn’t a personal story but after the recent news that Andrea Leadsom has dropped out of the race to become the next leader of the Conservative Party (and as a result PM of UK) Theresa May has now been declared to become the Next Prime Minister. I am so angry at the sexism of the BBC reporters whose recent articles introducing our new PM are so irrelevant. This is the BBC here. One article entitled “Theresa May: Seven notable things about the UK’s next Prime Minister” includes such ridiculous info. The seven things were: -she is an Orphan -she is notes for her choice of footwear -she has diabetes -How she met her husband -she us the longest seven home secretary – she didn’t make the list of top influential women -she enjoys crispy chips It might seem like a joke but it’s ridiculous and immature to report such nonsense about the next PM these similar themes occur in her ‘profile’ article also which I compared to Cameron ‘ s from 2010. No comments on fashion and less on partners and a lot more positive praise. The BBC do have other more serious articles on Theresa May but what the average person takes away from this article is demeaning. It focuses elsewhere on her lack of children and cooking hobbies! I don’t see the strong leading woman I know she is but instead a piece of writing that makes her seem weak, not influential, and a woman stereotypically associated with cooking and fashion and possibly disrespect for the absence of a mothering role she is supposed to have like all women! Stop! Who cares if she has no children or she likes chips. The media had more respect for Cameron when he began the job and the only difference I can see in how there backgrounds are portrayed is that she is a women which somehow makes relevant political info less important.

I let him know and his comments were ‘oh I’ll let her know’ to which I asked ‘why don’t you do it yourself?’ the response was ‘that’s not the sort of thing for a man to do.’ I’m an engineer. Is that not the sort of thing for a woman to do? "
"I am 19 and work at a golf club where most of the members tend to be older and retired men. One event I did recently, the Captain (in his 60s) was drinking. As the evening progressed he gradually became more and more inappropriate, first stating that “ohh you have legs, I have never seen them before you wear jeans, you should wear skirts more often”. During the speeches for the presentation he thanked me for serving drinks and “finishing him off later”, to which everyone laughed while I just stood there unsure what to do. Then afterwards he started asking me for a lift home. When it got quieter the other guy on the bar (who didnt get thanked in the speech) said that he could manage it and that I should leave before they got inappropriate. What counts as inappropriate then? My manager was there and he didnt do anything because ‘he was just joking and drunk’. The next time I was in I was told that the captain was embarrassed by his actions but I didnt get an apology or spoken to about it. And yet nothing has happened, I dont feel the need to report it because it is expected as we work with pervy old men and if we were to report it we would probably get told off for angering the members who frequently make comments like this. For example asking my little sister to go over and pick up a plate and then looking at her breasts as she leant down and going “see” to their friends before sending her away, but that is apparently acceptable because she is wearing a ‘low cut top’ regardless of the fact that she is 17.

"I am a professor at a well-known university, where supposedly people are supposed to be educated and informed about issues like sex discrimination. What I see at this institution is that only certain types of women are tolerated. Women who are quiet, who don’t challenge male abuses of authority and sex discrimination, escape notice. Women who don’t meet the expectation that women should be passive, submissive, and quiet are not tolerated. They are bullied, harassed, and generally demonized, simply because they choose to do their jobs and participate in academic/workplace discourse. Manifestations include a white-men’s club of opportunity perpetuating itself, where men who participate in this intolerance for unacceptable types of women advance each other through cronyism and favoritism so that women don’t get the opportunities that become available. I personally routinely experience efforts to silence my voice, including dropping me from communications about meetings so that I don’t know to attend, dropping me from e-mail communications so that I can’t voice my opinion, or ignoring my suggestions until they are repeated by a man (at which point the idea becomes fantastic). In a supervisory position I was harassed for over a year by two male ‘colleagues’ who routinely questioned my authority and competence in a way that was never applied to the male supervisors. I also see at my institution that women have to significantly out perform the men in order to be promoted, and even then they often don’t make it because they quit or leave under an extraordinarily toxic climate before succeeding in being promoted. Most disheartening is that the administrators of the institution are among the greatest offenders, including the women. Internalized misogyny is rampant, as women who have survived this culture of sex discrimination act like it is just part of academia and that other women should have to suffer and sell out like they did in order to advance. Even for the most senior executive officers there is no training in sex or any other kind of discrimination, making it almost impossible to change the status quo. "
"Because men hold most of the power, the onus is really on them to fight sexism and believe me, in my 25+ years in the workforce I’ve experienced and observed plenty of sexist garbage. From porn in my inbox, to being ignored in meetings, being condescended to (at a women’s coding course no less – by a man!), being asked if my 1999 mobile phone did double-duty as a vibrator, being harassed for going along with a dirty joke (for weeks)…That said, I’ve also been bullied and sexually harassed by women, and I’ve seen young men preyed upon by older women. Those dynamics are far less common, but should be part of the conversation. If I’ve learned anything in my five decades, it’s that insecure people will always look for a way to “get” you and demean you (and gratify themselves), where you are weakest. If it’s gender, that’s where they’ll hit you. If it’s youth and lack of status, they’ll get you there. Age? Race? Weight? Introversion? Anything where you “fall short” in their eyes. White, heterosexual men hold the cards. I keep telling myself, “be part of the conversation; don’t hold back”, but honestly, my life is a lot easier when I shut up and just do my job, say little to nothing in meetings, and perform to the low expectations of my gender. How sad is that? "

I am constantly presented with a stream of men looking to rent space from me who are incapable of looking me in the eye because they cannot stop looking at my nipples and the rest of my body while they are trying to convince me that they are trustworthy enough to hold keys to my building. They are incapable of hearing the word no from my mouth. They immediately begin to hoot and howl at me like dogs in heat and start making disparaging remarks about their girlfriends or soon to be ex girlfriends. I am strongly sex positive, but their crass, assuming boorish attitude boils by blood. They are unattractive, ignorant, slobbish, disrespectful, and unqualified for access to by building much less my bed. They refer to me in the third person as if I am not present by names such as “The Baby”. They ignore what I say. When they cannot get what they want they call me a dog and question what they imagine to be my morality or tell me how much better I would look if I grew out my hair (my head is closely shaved). They lecture me. They open doors without knocking. They leave their garbage behind. I feel sorry for them that they are so ignorant, usually poor, uneducated, but moreover, I feel sorry for the women in their lives, whoever they are. "
"A lot of derogatory words are not gender-specific, yet they’re only used to describe women. If I mention this fact or complain about it, I get told I’m being far too sensitive, yet the words are becoming gender-specific simply through over-use. Here are a couple of examples: 1. When we hear or see the word ‘stripper’ (and we aren’t thinking of home improvements!) we immediately think of a female taking off her clothes, not a male. If an establishment or business offers strippers and those strippers aren’t women, they’re advertised as ‘male strippers’. 2. If a man is being promiscuous, he’s referred to as a ‘man-whore’. Seriously, I’ve heard that quite often over the course of my life. The word ‘whore’ is not gender-specific – or shouldn’t be! – yet some feel the need to add to it when referring to a male. It doesn’t even sound derogatory, simply because it’s referring to a male. 3. If a ‘secretary’ is hired, the first impression is that the secretary will be female and will be there to be well-groomed, type and make the coffee/tea. If the ‘secretary’ turns out to be a man, it’s assumed that the man will be more of a PA to the boss, rather than a secretary, in a role where he doesn’t need to type his own or his boss’ stuff, has someone who’ll fetch the tea/coffee, etc etc. I’ve been a secretary/PA for most of my adult life, so I know what I’m talking about here. So, ‘secretary’ is becoming gender-specific. "

I went into Screwfix (UK) to pick it up, I gave the cashier chap my order number and he asked if it was a big or small package. I replied with ‘smallish’ and he went to fetch it, he came back with the hammer and asked incredulously ‘is this for you?’. I replied with ‘no, it’s for my Dad’, to which he replied ‘I was going to say, it’s a bit big and heavy!’. My answer was ‘Well i’m sure I can handle it but this time it’s not for me’.

"I’ve just transferred to a different city for my profession, and am relatively new to the workplace. Over the past few weeks, a male colleague has been making comments about my supposed ‘sex appeal’ and that he ‘cannot wait until rape is legalised in Australia’. There have been a number of these comments that have made their way back to me on the grape-vine. Yesterday, I was sitting in the lunch room with him, and deliberately sat at the opposite end. When he attempted mild conversation, I shrugged it off and went about ignoring him. Later, I heard that he had called me a ‘stuck up b*tch’. The worst part, is that I can’t help but feel bad about my coldness towards him! Is his behaviour considered to be such a norm, such a commonplace happening, that when I react to it it is seen to be out of line? "
"In my end of year review in 2015, my manager was giving me the ‘top 3’ things about me. So, I’m intelligent (okay…), positive (yes?) and… attractive. Well, this is awkward and we both feel uncomfortable. But he’s not coming onto me, he’s trying to be really positive and supportive and give me complimentary feedback, so why do I feel completely undermined? Maybe its because, for almost my entire adult life, since I was about 21, my appearance has constantly been the subject of feedback at work. And before that, I weighed around 89kg (14.5 stone) and it was never an issue then. But lose 30kg (6 stone) and all of a sudden its a game changer. When I lost the weight, I was away at university. When I returned to my summer job, the first time I saw many people was at the Christmas party. I had one particular incident with a male colleague who had been my supervisor regularly the previous summer. He told me I was gorgeous and he had to introduce himself… I pointed out we’d known each other for nearly 2 years, it’s just that you think I’m attractive now, I guess, so I’m worthy of your attention. Apparently before I wasn’t memorable in the slightest. "
"Yesterday at work, my creeper of a boss crept up behind me, placed his hands on my side and started kissing my cheek, all while asking for coffee. I shook him off and quickly moved away. Not long after a male colleague of mine asked if he could kiss me “just on the cheek, because [he was] in a good mood”. Repulsed, I immediately and without hesitation replied that no, he most certainly could not. AND HE DEMANDED TO KNOW WHY NOT AND ASKED AGAIN IF HE COULD KISS ME. BECAUSE MY SAYING “NO, YOU CANNOT KISS ME” WAS, TO HIM THE BEGINNING OF A NEGOTIATION. I’m on my way out the door right now to print CVs and look for another job. "

A child will make you complete.’ This is soooo incredibly offensive on many levels. The idea that I am somehow less than, or incomplete, because I don’t have a child or a husband. The idea that my worth is solely based on my looks, and once my looks ‘fade’ I am worthless, a ‘spinster’, unable to ‘get a man’. Everyday sexism is alive and well, and positively flourishing! "
"I’ve had numerous instances of sexism occur in my workplace. Today’s instance was slight – a colleague visiting from a remote office dropped off a package at my desk. The package was not addressed to me and might I add, I am not an admin/office manager.

I’m getting really sick of it, and when I stood up for myself and declared myself a feminist, he got all defensive and kept saying ‘you’re one of THOSE feminist nutters’. He thinks he’s being funny but I’m sick of it. "

But that’s not my job description. I wish I’d had the guts to say something. "
"I had a job in 3-month long project at a big company that designs and manufactures large industrial machines. The woman-to-man ratio at the office was what you (sadly) might expect from a place that employs mostly engineers. Most often I was the only woman in the meetings or at the lunch table. I didn’t have much previous experience in similar working environment, but it became quite obvious that most of the people just weren’t used to women hanging around. Some of the especially older men – even though well-meaning and friendly – were just incapable of conjuring up small talk that would not address my sex, age or looks. There were quite a few incidents that demonstrated the whole “man’s world” feel that was prevalent in that office which often made me feel like an outsider as a young career-driven woman, but I’ll share just one: Every day in the office I would walk past a 1,5m high miniature model of the machine our team was working on. The project was making a new prototype and it was therefore (sic) named after a woman (we can call her Geena). There was a “logo” of Geena printed on white paper and stuck to the side of the miniature model, and the logo was a picture of a 50’s style pin-up girl in a bikini. As a feminist I felt that, as I was just eager to get on with my work, representing industrial machines as half-naked ladies was a needless reminder that we women were still being constantly objectified and sexualized by men, even at the workplace. So it was not super cool. However, I didn’t say anything because I hoped to be working in the same company later, so didn’t want to appear too fussy or difficult. On my last day, the head designer presented me with an unofficial certificate that I had been working on this prototype project (“____ has been a part of the Geena project…. We thank him for his hard work blabla..”. The certificate had a half-page size picture of the same pin-up logo, and referred to me with the male pronoun “he”, because that’s how they had written the template. I felt like these people really need a lesson on workplace equality and inclusiveness, but AGAIN ended up not saying anything to anyone, because I appreciated the gesture and so didn’t want to appear ungrateful or difficult.

And I fucking love them. I think they’re cool as all Hell. My hair was up the other day at work and I noticed one of my older, male bosses makong faces out of the corner of my eye. I turned to address him and he quickly asked me “why did you do that to yourself? You know men don’t like that?”. I told him, albeit politely, that it’s nothing to me what men prefer or don’t prefer and I don’t style myself according to the wishes of others. Why he thought he could ever speak to me like that is beyond me! "
"I work in a hospital. I went to see an older male patient today to discuss part of his treatment. As I began to leave towards the door, I asked him if he needed anything else? He replied saying “I wish dear – but it’s only a single bed.” WAS THIS MAN UNABLE TO SEE ME AS ANYTHING ELSE BUT AN OBJECT TO DELIVER SEXUAL PLEASURE?Was I not just speaking to him at length about a complicated medical procedure? Had I not extensively explained the recent evidence describing the risks and benefits of his treatment? Clearly all my words had done was to arouse this pre-evolutionary ape. Because of my position as a professional, I was unable to say anything that may have been equally offensive to him as a man. So I simply walked out. Had this been outside of my workplace, I would have kicked him extremely hard in his testicles and broken his walking stick in half. There was no point escalating the issue at work – my colleagues, both female and male, would have found his comments hilarious. Angry Young Woman "

He was asked what he challenges women faced as barristers. He said “that being a woman was a style too, as women counsel could flirt with the jury”. All the women on the course were completely crushed. Never became a barrister. "
"So I’ve been working in this little cafÃ© in France for a couple of months now. I’m the only waitress (it’s really little) so every day it’s just me and my boss. I’m 20 years old and my boss is about 50, additionally he’s told me has two daughters, so in my eyes his behaviours is even more inappropriate. He has a bit of a temper on him and switches between shouting at me for stupid little stuff, to being overly nice to me. Unfortunately what he regards as being ‘nice’ is him telling me I look beautiful repeatedly. Nice enough the first time, but obviously it makes me uncomfortable. Additionally he repeatedly refers to me as ‘baby’ and tells me I look ‘sexy’ even though I’ve told him that this isn’t appropriate. One time I wore white jeans and my boss would not stop talking about how my ass looked in them so I don’t dare wear them again. It gets super hot at work but I feel like I have to dress soo covered up to avoid my boss making comments. Even when I wear chiffon culottes my boss makes loads of excuses to touch them to ‘see what the material is like’. He’ll also pretend I have crumbs or chalk on my legs or ass so he can try and wipe it off. He also always asks me if I have a boyfriend, and when I say no, he says he’s surprised because I’m so ‘exigeant’ (oh btw he doesn’t speak a word of english, we’re in France here) and recently he’s started asking if I’m gay and have a girlfriend. Then yesterday a guy came in to fix the fan downstairs, I greeted him when he arrived, and he looked right through me as if I didn’t even exist and said to my boss ‘Where do you hide these beautiful girls and what do you do with them!’ I was so embarrassed and outraged. I’ve been trying to quit since May but my boss said that I’m obliged to stay all summer as thats what I said I would work however after this I’m 100% leaving at the end of the month. "
"I was at work taking sandwiches off the shelves to reduce the price. 3 men came up to look for sandwiches. All 3 were much taller than me and looked like they worked out. One of them stood on my left and two on the right. I was bent over, retrieving sandwiches from the bottom shelf and stood up. As I turned to place the sandwiches on the trolley, the man closest to me got in my face and said ” my friends going to smack you on the bum” and he laughed loudly right into my face. I replied ” if he does, he’ll get thrown out of the store”. The friend then said “I’m not that desperate”. I said, “this isn’t funny” and the friend replied “it’s not me, it’s him”. At this point, they started to get angry with me for not finding this all absolutely hilarious. They left muttering about what an uptight bitch I am. After they’d gone, I phoned my section leader to tell her I was going home because I felt threatened. The general store manager, however, said that it was “just a bit of banter that I took too personally” and that because I was in a store and they wouldn’t attack me: this is despite the fact that I have had a customer attack me with a bottle and a fellow colleague was attacked outside the store. And the shop has been held up at gun point, and on one occasion, crowbars. I think I’ve been dismissed and mansplained by the manager. I’m now considering what my next step should be as I have been unsupported by management. This sexism stuff won’t stop because women complain about it; it will only stop when men start to speak out against it, actively, when they are with their friends and colleagues. "
"I work at a University in a large diverse city. I always promote equality in every opportunity I have to students and colleagues. Today I have been extremely disappointed by a (female) colleague who said that she would not wear a sleeveless top when teaching our students because there were a large proportion for whom this would be considered immodest. I challenged this comment and said that whilst we should respect everyone’s beliefs and faiths, we should also expect our faiths and beliefs, and choice of dress to be respected in return. A sleeveless top in a professional outfit is not to be considered immodest in the UK??? She then went on to say “well I would not wear a sleeveless top in a Church”, to which I replied, I agree, but this is not a Church, it is a University. How on earth are we preparing students for life and work in the UK by this behaviour???? Furthermore, do men have to consider such ridiculous concepts? Am I now to be called a racist because of my comments? Why is this not an obvious manner in which to add further shame to women and their bodies in a Western country? This colleague is a very educated (PhD) woman who was in her late thirties. This realisation of her intellect only added to my despair. "
Having individual interviews at work about changes in terms and conditions and got told by the hr manager that the extra days leave will be really helpful to me as a mother. I asked the guy who had his interview before me if he got told the extra leave would be useful as a parent. He didn’t. 
"I have spent sixteen years working in the wine trade. I have a pretty damn good palate, acknowledged by friends and peers. I hold the diploma of wine and would say I am very knowledgeable about the areas I sell wine in. The directors of our company are men and have formed a ‘special wine club’ for their top-spending clients. Inevitably (and sadly in my business) these are all men. I have never been invited along to these dinners, even though I speak and sell wine to these clients on a daily basis. It didn’t bother me too much. I envisage it as being a Bullingdon Club atmosphere and hardly feel I am missing out on scintillating talk, although the wine of course would be another matter. However, a new male employee who shares my job title and is supposedly my equal was invited along to the first dinner immediately! The first time this happened they had the decency to sneak around the subject and speak in hushed tones. Now however, they are quite happy to plan openly and make the sexist snub obvious. And insult to injury? On their way out to the most recent dinner where they will consume old, rare and expensive wine, they opened a bottle of Â£5 Spanish white for the ‘ladies left in the office’.

"I am reading the book Everyday Sexism and I just finished reading the chapter on the workplace. It was unrelenting the garbage that women have to put up with at work. I have worked at a Catholic Girls High School as a teacher for 17 years. I was thinking how good I have it because I work with some really great men. Then I remembered what happened probably 15 years ago. I was talking with a female teacher in the hallway. As she walked away, I noticed two male colleagues make a gesture in the front of their pants as they both stared at the back of my friend. I know I have it good in that I have only experienced something inappropriate once in 17 years. It still made me sad when I remembered that moment because one of the men I really respect. That is not to say that I haven’t experienced sexual harassment at work before. I worked making pizzas in college. I was one of the few women who did that and I was barraged by sexual jokes and comments. I didn’t like it at all but didn’t know what to do about it. It was years later that I even heard the words sexual harassment and I finally put a name to what I experienced. "
"I am 22, just finished college and is working as an interpreter for an IT company in my country of Vietnam. I’ve just finished my 3rd week. I’m the youngest in the team, and it’s a small team of 8-10 people, depends on the day. I’m rarely called by my name – I’m usually “hotgirl”, or “cute girl”, or “pretty girl”. I’m seated by the team secretary next to the boss “so our boss looks good having a pretty girl by his side” during meetings. I’m called on to hangouts parties and drinkings between the guys in the team and the partner company at least 3 times per week, and for a 5 days work week, I can only say no so many times before they called me a hermit and antisocial and ask why I’m being such a bored. All the guys in the team and the partnering company are all married, some are even my dad’s age. But they joke around about “well on projects away from home like this, it’s so easy to get a hookup from some pretty 23, 24 years old girl – hey, how old are you? 22? Yeah 22 is fine too”. They were all talking about a bisexual guy they know of one evening – and being all discriminated and disgusted with him. Then the team leader turned around and asked me “hey do you like girls too?” – and I knew what he wanted to hear, because I’ve heard him being a bigot so many times before – but I was pissed. I was so annoyed and was done sitting silently and smilling like nothing is wrong – so I said “yeah, sure. Girls are amazing, why wouldn’t I like them?” – and he felt silence. It was one of the best day I’ve had at work so far. "
". I was taking out the trash as usual and the cook was like “Just roll the trash can out, you cant lift that.” as if i havent been doing that since I first started working here. So im incredulous and I say “…I “cant”?” so I start rolling it out to the curb and he literally runs to get someone and i see my coworker walk out of the store with this smug expression on his face. and i was like “what are you doing out here?” “well they sent me to come help you.” “I dont need your help, go back inside.” and he just ignores me and tries to half-assedly help but eventually goes inside because (shock and surprise!!) i am capable of putting trash in a garbage can. It’s just. the audacity. if it had been a guy they would NEVER have done that. Its infuriating. Ive never asked for help ever, i lift heavy shit by myself all the time, i can do everything they can do but they treat me like i cant and ignore me when i say stop. UGH. "
"I live in a different country from my child. The other week, a male colleague and peer whi has no children decided to “inform” me that children need their mothers much, MUCH more than their fathers, especially when they’re at the age mine is. I asked him where he got that crock of blatant misogyny from and noticed that he seemed thoroughly stumped when I asked him if children whose mothers have unfortunately died are doomed in life and what he makes of the proven fact that gay couples are equally as effective as straight couples are at raising children. Just goes to show that one should educate oneself upon a topic before one opens one’s mouth. "

"I am 14 years old. I work at a gymnastics club, coaching young girls from the age of 4-10 in gymnastics. The other day, two mid-twenty year old men got onto the premise, and stood outside the door watching me, and three 6 year old girls. They wolf-whistled, and shouted about my boobs and ass, in front of these girls.They seemed to think that it was acceptable, and that it was how women wanted to be treated, and used the excuse that it was just how they had been brought up, but they were at least 20 years old, so they had 20 years to condition themselves to the social acceptability of this situation. A similar situation happened on my Duke of Edinburgh expedition, when we walked past a group of boys, who began shouting at us, and looked shocked when we asked them on what level was it acceptable to sexually objectify women and girls.

"It can be difficult to draw a line between someone being helpful and someone treating me differently for being a woman. This afternoon I have had men make a point of holding doors open for me (he reached the door just before me from the other side, and rather than hold it open as he walked through, he held the door with his back to let me pass through without needing to hold the door). I’ve also had an offer to help carry a large item to my car (it was neither heavy nor particularly awkward). I doubt any male counter parts would have been so politely received. "
"Often our church office administrator will receive phone calls from someone asking to speak to the pastor. When the call is forwarded to me, the pastor, the person calling sometimes says, “oh. May I speak with the Senior Pastor,” implying that as a woman I couldn’t possibly be the senior pastor. I experience this as well when meeting someone for the first time and answering the question, “what do you do for a living?” Even though I answer, “I’m a pastor,” the person will assume I mean children’s pastor and will ask me questions about the children’s ministry of the church.

"Had my first performance review at a relatively new job. The main “critique” I received was that I come across as “too severe” with the way I communicate with both internal and external people, and that I should try to come across as “softer” and “more friendly.” My superior shared that WHAT I was saying was correct, but HOW I was saying it was “off-putting.” When I asked for specific examples (apparently there were several) so I could see where I went wrong and try to fix it, my superior refused to share because that would mean they’d have to name names of the people who think I am “severe.” However, I am also still doing a “great job” overall.

"I work as a part-time waitress while I’m studying. One evening, a customer asked for some extra milk with his tea. I poured some into a jug and brought it over to him. He asked me if I was married (I was 17 at the time) to which I replied no. He then proceeded to comment ‘you’d want to be a bit more generous with your servings or the poor bloke will starve.’ I replied ‘I wouldn’t marry someone incapable of pouring a jug of milk.’ "
"Last week, I was filling in an online application form for a DBS check. I am applying to Kent County Council for a Chaperone license to help out at my kids’ drama group. When asked for my title, I ticked ‘Ms’. I am married, but did not change my name when I got married. I didn’t use to mind whether I was called Miss or Ms…as long as it wasn’t Mrs! Now, after reading your book, I always use Ms….simply on the basis that it is of no concern to anyone whether I am married or not! Anyway….back to this form…further down the form, it asked for any previous surnames I might have been known by. As this is for the purposes of checking my criminal record, I can see that it is relevant. However, as I do not have a previous surname, I did not complete the box. Sure enough, it wouldn’t let me submit the form, saying there was an error…this box needed to be completed. But I had nothing to write in it! So I tried again….this time the error message was more specific. The only way I could have no previous surname was if I was ‘Miss’ in the first box. So, being married but not wanting to be known as married (i.e. using Ms) was not an option. Their assumption therefore, is that all women who use ‘Ms’ MUST be married or have used a different surname at some point in their lives?! Staggering. So the only way I could successfully complete the form was to change by title to ‘Miss’. Keep up the excellent work!! "
"I have so many stories to share! When I was in my mid 20s in about 2002 to 2007 I worked for a mortgage company that generally had their HR policies and department working well. However, my male boss didn’t seem to acknowledge them. Every morning in our case review meeting with my other male colleague, my boss would start off by either sharing a blonde joke or asking me about my sex life to see who could get me to go red first “for fun.” When I proved myself in my role and applied for a promotion that was available, I was constantly chased by HR as my boss had not progressed the application on our work system. When I finally asked for a meeting my boss made it clear that, despite doing the job of my male colleague whilst he was on a sabbatical, I was not experienced enough and was basically the team assistant. The role was eventually offered to a young man from another department who I had to train so he could do the job. I left. In a current role in a small privately owned manufacturing firm there are about 25 people and 6 of these are women. The boss has his wife working into the early hours of the morning almost every night in the office whilst he wonders in and out at leisure as it’s her job to run the “non-money making” side. The men freely discuss women who visit the office and rate their appearance in front of us. Innuendo is the order of the day every day and anyone who doesn’t like it is seen as being boring. The women started having children/getting married about 2 years ago and the boss made it clear he was not happy. The first lady to have children met with an angry response to her announcement and was not allowed to come back and do part-time hours, which would have been fine for the role she was doing. She eventually left as she was spending too much time away from her children and couldn’t continue her full-time hours. The team of women were “jokingly” told not to “get any ideas.” Another lady got pregnant and the boss again got angry. He openly joked with the men in front of the women that he wasn’t happy with the women going off and getting pregnant and said he “wouldn’t employ women” going forward. The 6 women (apart from his wife) are all of the same age and are all considering having children at some point. We all know and have discussed how we will not be supported in this, have little to no maternity package and will not be able to return part-time to the Company. There is no HR department, no written policies and despite my campaigning to have a Company come and help us/outsource they’re more interested in the making money and supporting those who are seen as making the Company money (Male sales team and male manufacturing team). It’s so sad to still see this in 2016. "
"The other day, my pervert boss came up next to me and asked me if I was doing my job correctly. At the time, I was testing magnets by holding them close to metal to see if they magnet held or came off. If it held, I put it into a box, marked it okay, and moved on to the next. If the magnet came off, I glued it back on and put it into a box etc etc. Not exactly a difficult task. The only thing about it could possibly be difficult would be fucking it up. Nevertheless, my boss stopped next to me and implied I was fucking it all up. He then tore open a completed box and began re-testing the magnets. He got bored quickly after finding that I had done it correctly and, with a smirk, insisted that I was “lucky” to have done it correctly before walking away. I was left to clean up the mess he made in tearing the box open and contemplate how “lucky” I was to have not fucked up a ridiculously easy task. He NEVER speaks so disrespectfully to my male co-workers. This same man made me kiss him on the cheek after correcting a mistake I made. He then told me to make more mistakes so that he could make me kiss him more. My skin crawls when he’s around and there’s nothing I can do cos he’s my manager. I’m currently searching for another job. "
Chatting to a male colleague at a conference. Another man joins the conversation excusing his interruption by saying ‘I am sure of would rather speak to this pretty young lady but can I borrow you?’ In one sentence I was reduced to no more than a pretty object. Any desire to talk with me is no longer due to my capacity to provide stimulating conversation but my capacity to be enjoyed on a physical level. The words dried up in my mouth. I felt like I was five.

"I teach watersports in a very male dominated environment (I am the only female instructor, and everybody more senior than me is male as well). The owner of the sports club is a 70 year old man, who is slightly out of date with what is ‘politically correct’ to say, but well meaning. I am his clear favourite amongst the staff, and he treats me far better than the rest of the team (eg if i were to be a few minutes late, or when i perfom worse than the others). I am also less experienced a sportsman and teacher than all of my male collegues, also about 20/30+ kilos lighter than them (which matters in a boat). They all notice how much the owner favours me, and their way of dealing with it is to point it out consistently, and also to tell me constantly that I am not good enough, and that im just there because of the favouritism. This makes my (already rock bottom) confidence even lower, which impacts how I perform, which fuels their fire. Whats even worse is that the kids that we are teaching (13/14yr old boys!!!!) sense this, and it completely undermines me in front of them, and then they learn these kinds of behaviours too. Sometimes the other instructors are openly aggressive to me on the water because they know I have conflict, as opposed to a boy who would just shout his way out of it if he had right of way. I will always back down before i have a collision, despite having ‘right of way’. One of the other instructors told me to my face that the kids (13 year old boys) he was teaching told him that I was well known to be ‘useless but pretty’. One of the other instructors asks me everyday what I’ve brought him for lunch. 616 This lunchtime I spent the whole hour in tears in the girls bathroom, which i have to myself. "
"The other day, I got angry with a co-worker. He has crossed lines before, with his misogyny, but I simply wasn’t in the mood to let it roll off my back this particular morning. I arrived at work and he proceeded to catch me by my face as I struggled and kiss my face, close to mouth. It made me want to scream at him to leave me alone, but I managed to hold my tongue, to “not make a scene”. An hour or so later, he caught my face again and I struggled more aggressively this time, avoided eye contact and wondered aloud why people won’t stop touching me when I don’t want them to. But the final straw came a little while after that when he spoke down to me again. It was a slow day and there were only 4 people in my shop, 2 couples, that happened to be browsing souvenirs right next to one another. A vital part of my job is to watch people in the shop in case they steal. I work in an open market and strealing is common. As such, I was watching these 4 people like a hawk. I could see in my peripheral vision if anyone else entered the shop as I watched. So this co-worker, who is my peer, was passing by and took it upon himself to attract my attention from watching these people to “inform” me to watch the whole shop. I have worked there for 6 months, I know how to do my job. I was doing my job, and he interrupted me to mansplain to me how to do my job. So, in response I give him the most withering “no shit Sherlock, fuck off” look I could muster and go about my business. You would think he would get the message, but no. He proceeds to neglect his own work and yell, in front of the potential customers, “What? Tarry, what?? Did I do something wrong? Are you okay??”. I ignore him and he leaves only to reappear a few minutes later. He comes into right in front of my register and proceeds to grill me about if I have a problem with him. He nearly crashes right into a customer with the giant crate he’s holding. I tell him to get back to work. He goes away and I start to settle. Then, maybe two hours later, comes back to make lunch. He acts like a fucking wounded animal around me. He says “Hi Tarry” in the most depressed, sad voice as he comes in and “Bye Tarry” as he leaves again. I don’t know if he was trying to make me feel guilty or something, but it just annoyed me. A few days prior, this same co-worker didn’t like the facial expression I wore as I just went about my business. He felt it was too “sad” and KEPT pestering me as to what was wrong. I told him nothing was wrong and, because he would NOT stop, I had to tell him to leave me alone. He then gave me a mini lecture about how I should arrange my facial expression so I look happy and I put everyone around me at ease. I told him once more, in very slow, emphasised words, to leave me alone. "
I was working at a bookstore while I was in graduate school. We had a huge signing with people wrapped around the building. I was outside talking with some of the customers when the manager walked up to talk with me. One of the customers said I was doing a good job. The manager patted me on the head. I didn’t say anything then because of all the people. The next day I gathered my courage and told the manager that what he did was insulting and belittling. I think and hope he understood. 
"I started a new job as an HR assistant for a construction firm in February. Within the first couple of weeks my manager had made several comments about maternity leave, and outright asked me if I wanted children! Because I am living with my partner and 31, I think they assume that I’m going to just run off and get pregnant. It even feels like it would be criminal to do so! I am worried that if and when we do decide to have a baby, that I will be treated unfairly or even dismissed. Ultimately though I just find it really shocking to be asked these type of highly personal questions. The same manager has also commented on my weight and made other inappropriate remarks. To be honest though, I had applied for so many jobs and I do feel that my age and risk of pregnancy was a factor in me not even being considered for interviews. "
"On being pregnant with my first child, I was told by the COO of the company I worked for that I ‘would be no bloodying use at all once that baby was born’.

Eventually my employer compromised my contract and paid me off. "

"Hi. My names Tori and I’m from the Uk. I’m 17, and I’ve never really realised that sexism was still relevant until about a year ago when I started getting comments about my body, specifically my “lack of tits” quote from a person in my high school who said that I couldn’t draw nudes because “I have to have tits before I could draw them”. That was when I really started noticing. I’m a young artist, who’s Inspiration is nude women. I love to do nudes because everyone is unique and a piece of art and I love to recreate the individuality of that person onto canvas and paper, but now that I’ve started branching out into the art world, people (specifically men) have told me that it isn’t right for a lady to be doing nudes. That I should ” stick to drawing kittens and flowers”. Or that my art wasn’t erotic because there was to much “emotion” on my muses face. Just last week, workmen who were doing power lines next to my college yelled degrading things about my body ” nice Pusey, shame about the tits though” to each other. I was less than a meter away. Another time the same crew shouted at me “hay baby, wanna hang out at my place, I’ll show what it is to be a woman.” I feel horrified and scared. Sometimes I feel like I’m not a real woman because my chest isn’t largely endowed or that men don’t respect me because I’ve not got large breasts or I’m not tall. I feel like they don’t respect me because I’m intelligent, that they see my worth, not how much I can contribute to society but how good a f*** I’d be. Don’t get me wrong, I know not all men are like this, but the male members in my family say just ignore them, don’t take it personally. Your a grown women now, you have to expect it. I just feel like I’m not respected or acknowledged because I’m a woman. Does anyone else feel like this? "
"Walked into the staff room at work to a room full of my (normally lovely) male colleagues. As I walked in, one called out ‘are you wearing a see through top?!’ (Incidentally, I wasn’t). All of them turned to look at me. A second then piped up loudly ‘how’s your spot?’ in reference to the pimple I had on my chin, which of course proceeded to switch their attention from my clothes to my face. When I asked said colleague why he was asking me that, he said it was ‘because you always look so flawless normally’. I can’t envisage him having the same kind of conversation with one of his male colleagues- just one more example of the casual way in which some men still undermine women professionally by implicitly reducing their worth back to the aesthetic.

"I called meeting about some renovation work and prepared for it for a week. I created spread sheets and had all the data we needed laid out. When I showed up, on time, the two guys had already met, duplicated my work and made decisions without me. "
"While completing my degree I worked several part-time jobs, and the most important thing I have taken from them is that if you are a waitress, you will be bombarded with sexist and disrespectful comments on a regular basis and management will care more about the money than about protecting their workers. My first job was at a 5* hotel, where I would be whistled at, winked at, given invitations to go back to men’s rooms and openly groped at while going around collecting plates and glasses. The managers insisted that I not make a fuss about it, because these people were paying lots of money to stay in the hotel. A few years later I started a waitressing job at a small establishment, thinking it would be different and the management would not tolerate this sort of behaviour. I could not have been more wrong. Last week I was the lone waitress for a table of 12 middle-aged men on a golfing trip. Within three minutes I’d already had several comments made about how “pretty” I was, and how the other waitresses “must be jealous” of how I looked. I bent over to pick up a menu and was told by the man in front of me “thanks for treating me” – I wasn’t wearing anything remotely close to a low cut top. Streams of comments about my breasts and bum continued throughout my time serving them. One of the group tried to hold onto my hand and lean in to my chest as he ordered his food. As they continued to drink their behaviour just got more and more raucous, to the point where they began chanting “you’re fit and you know it” as I walked away from them. Shaking with rage, I went back to the bar and spoke with the owner – who found it hilarious. He told me to bear it and “think of the tips”. I left that job the next day. "
The AC at the office broke and a guy suggested all ladies wear bikinis to work from now on….!?!?!?!?!? And then he laughed like a hyena. 
"was shown round a prospective workplace and I get wolf whistled at and “hire her, she’s fit”. Embarrassing to say the least! "
I work in my local pub and normally I really enjoy it but the other day an older man thought that slapping my bum was ok. Because it was my job to be kind and friendly I had to brush it off and act as if it was all ok; when in reality that is counted as sexual assault as I didn’t give consent to this man slapping my bum but in today’s society I shouldn’t be complaining as it’s ‘not a big deal’… 
"Walking along Long Lane SE1 at lunchtime today to grab a bite to eat. Jeans, flip flops, leather jacket with a baggy T underneath. A man in a white well known branded van stuck in traffic not 15 feet from me yells ” COR FAHKIN ‘ELL! YOURE GORGEOUS DARLIN!” Me, “AWWW! I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME TO YOU “DARLIN’l! OH WELL I GUESS NOT EVERYONE IS AS LUCKY AS ME!” I shout even louder with a huge smile. Older lady next to me creases up. 1-0 to us. "
"I was talking with the girl I sit next to in class about how we didn’t want to have kids. My psychology teacher, who is a great guy in other respects, decided that he should step in and inform me that “I would change my mind.” I’ve been told the exact same thing by my female manager at a charity shop I volunteered at for a while. When I informed my teacher that ‘if he wanted to avoid getting lynched by a mob of teenage girls in the future, he should probably stop telling them they would change their minds about their own important life decisions,’ he responded with “We’ll see.” I was so pissed off. "
"I teach on a short course at a UK university which is mainly attended by students much older than myself (I’m 24). During a practical, a middle-aged man asked me about a common but outdated/misleading piece of language used when interpreting statistics. I told him that the use of language was inappropriate, clearly backed up why and explained how careful we must be when choosing language for these sorts of things. I was told that I apparently had “a very strong opinion” and that I “can’t be completely correct” because he uses it a lot. Why did he bother asking? "
"Today, my creep boss came back from several weeks of vacation. As I said hello, he twirled me around in front of all my colleagues and dipped me as though we were dancing and began KISSING MY FACE AND DOWN TO MY NECK! I work with his goddamn wife who only works on occasion because their 2 year old son needs to be taken care of. Everyone laughed as this happened and as he chastised me for the taste of my perfume on my neck! I wanted to cry. Even though I was utterly repulsed, I still feel now like I’ve been unfaithful to the man that I love because of this man’s actions. To end the day, myself and my female colleague were discussing her progress in a Dutch language class that she takes. This man suggested, in a very thinly veiled way, that we give out boyfriends blowjobs in order to perfect how the Dutch pronounce gutteral “G’s in the language. He even demonstrated, gagging sounds and head motions and all! For our benefit! Lucky us! He said out BFs would really enjoy it so everyone wins. Jesus fucking Christ, HOW IS IT OKAY THAT HE SUBJECTS US TO THIS??? "
In my teens I was repeatedly called out in the street by adult men making sexual remarks; my male classmates chased me after school to touch my bum and breast; In my early 20s I was sexually assaulted by a male colleague after giving him a lift; I used to be called ‘frigid’ by an ex-boyfriend for not wanting to have sex; a few years back a man touched me in a crowded underground train…. 
"I work in a mental health service. One day one of my clients disclosed to me that she had been hit by her husband whilst driving a car with her young daughter in the back seat. I encouraged her to report this to the police, sensitively reminding her she had done the right thing in speaking out about this. At our next session she explained that the police(woman) had totally dismissed her story, told her to ‘stop crying’ whilst giving her statement and later informed my client she had ‘provoked’ her husband by swearing at him. My client was devastated at this blatant disregard for her personhood and I felt mortified I had indirectly subjected her to this further abuse. I went to talk to my male manager about this case, expecting him to offer advice on how it could be managed. He raised his eyebrow: ‘that sounds terrible, almost too terrible to be true’. I left the office with a knot in my stomach and a heavy heart. What world is this that we are living in when even those put in post to safeguard victims, perpetuate misogyny? "
"In a conversation with a board member, I mentioned that I would be out of town an upcoming weekend to celebration my graduation, as I was finishing up my second masters degree. He remarked, “Wow, you’ve got more letters after your name than before.” Same board member, upon discovering that I was in a nine year relationship but not married and with no intention of getting married, said, “What’s the matter with him? Is he afraid of commitment?” "
"Today’s first example of sexism going unnoticed by women. This was a paragraph in a marketing blog email I got today. Written for women by women!!! There will also be a marketplace where some of our enterprising ladies will be showcasing their products and services, allowing the delegates to do what women do best; shop! "
"Another point is that there are a lot of jokes going around in my workplace as well as even otherwise in social situations if I’m a lesbian because I have chosen to remain unmarried till 33. In India, its a sign that there is something wrong with you mentally or that you are lesbian (and for many Indians, they equate reason one to reason two). Apparently its inconceivable that I want to remain single. "
"I am an Indian living in Mumbai and I see guys who pass inappropriate remarks in the guise of humour. However, when we understand the sexual implication of the usually lame jokes, they think we are sexually promiscuous or at least, judge our morality because we “understood” adult jokes. And this happens in the workplace with adults. Also, while recently discussing the increase of rapes in our capital, one guy commented that “so and so victim didn’t deserve to die… its not as if she was sitting up late in a bar and chatting with strangers”. Which means that according to Indian men, women who sit late in bars, chat with people and wear “western clothing” *deserve* to be raped? "
Once a man and his wife came into my job and after leaving the man made a comment to his wife about how my breasts distracted him (I had a DDD size cup). She then filed a formal complaint to the corporate office about my ‘provocative’ attire ‘distracting’ her husband. I was wearing a job-issued t-shirt and was 16 years old. 
"I am a pastor. I do almost everything my male colleagues do – preach, counsel, teach, visitations, etc. I graduated from seminary with multiple academic awards. But I do not have the title “pastor”, even though I have equivalent (and in some cases higher) qualifications than my male colleagues. I am excluded from being able to conduct or even serve the Eucharist. I am excluded from the possibility of being ordained (a process in which the entire church affirms your vocation and calling, after which one is given the title “Reverend”.) I am excluded from the possibility of ever being in the top level of leadership and decision-making. And my lead pastor could ask me, “You mean you feel oppressed here?” Routinely when I introduce myself or what I do professionally, a look of confusion or disbelief crosses people’s faces. Often I have to repeat or explain several times what it is that I do. When I mention that I work in church, most assume I do administrative support. Because people cannot comprehend that a young female can or would be in a pastoral role. I love my God, my faith and my church. But having my legitimacy questioned on a regular basis just because of my gender really wears me down. "
"In class today we got to have a sneak book at our year book as we are soon leaving school, three males in the class immediately began flicking through the pictures of the females with commentary on each one. This followed the tangent of “would bang, would bang, would bang, I’d destroy her. Oh I wouldn’t do her, she’s too arrogant. She looks like she’d know what she was doing, bet she’d be well dirty. She has an amazing ass….but no tits. Uhhhh blowjob mouth there” and much much more. They said one girl “looked like a lesbian” and what a waste that was, obviously if you can’t fuck her then there’s no point in knowing her. Basically reduced all the women they go to school with to their sexual appeal and did so whilst holding the book up so I couldn’t see whom they were discussing. They could have been discussing me or any of the other women in the class and I suspect so as they kept watching my reaction, it was intimidating and pathetic. Then they began to laugh at the girls they “wouldn’t bang” and played farm animal noises to one girl’s picture in particular and calling her fat. There was also a competition to find who they thought would have the “dirtiest vagina”, obviously the side effect of having sex is dirt in your vagina. They were trying to find a perfect page full of girls they would fuck and kept complaining when girls ruined this streak by not being attractive to them. Absolutely disgusting, they also considered making lists. Through the whole thing I kept telling them to stop with this vile sexism and misogyny and told them exactly what I thought of them and they would be fired from a workplace for behaving in that way- they continued maintaining I didn’t get the joke and it was just a laugh. Sorry, the objectification of women is not funny. I am not a piece of meat and will not listen to women being reduced to their orifices, breasts and ass. All were 17-18 years old and about to go to university. All the others guys in the room laughed with them and said nothing, all the other women were clearly uncomfortable but sat quietly and said nothing. Very glad I spoke up to them, as always, but it made no effect whatsoever. Maybe got me on the “wouldn’t bang” list hopefully. "
"I was speaking to my mum about work and possible careers for myself the other day, bringing up what she did and how soon she went back to work after having me. She told me that her mum was actually annoyed at her for going back to work so soon, telling her that her role was now to bring up me, not to work. Why is the assumption made that once women have children they become inferior to their husbands; ‘the breadwinners’, and that women’s work in comparison is seen as extra pocket money? I thought these kind of stereotypes were extremely outdated, it really shocked me. "
"In my six month work placement I act as a point of reference/receptionist for an academic department at the university I’m studying at. Note: I am the youngest female by far in the entire department (young 20s, next youngest is probably early 40s). The people I work alongside are lovely, particularly the amazing ladies in my reception, however, I have been talked over so many times by the male academics, at one point ridiculed for my choice of academic direction (aiming for a doctorate in the arts). There is an older academic there who only works 3 times a week, but every time he’s in, he makes a point to slowly walk past the reception to look in if the other two ladies in the office are there. If they are, he will give me a wink and walk slowly past. If they aren’t, he will come in and start commenting on my outfit for the day, even though I’ll be sitting down and trying to hide as much of it as possible. He will always say complimentary (but uncomfortable) things, such as: ‘Not wearing that black tight skirt today, that does wonders for your figure….not that you need it of course’, ‘You dress very girly… nice and youthful’ ‘Different outfit everyday… it’s like a little fashion show for us!’ etc. He also makes a point of pausing and slowly watching me as I walk down the corridor. But it isn’t even the comments that make me feel the most uncomfortable; it’s the fact he just stares straight into my eyes, unblinking, expecting me to be thankful and coy for all this attention. I would say it’s a generation thing, as he is in his late 70s, where perhaps this kind of attention was more common, but I don’t want to give him any excuse. The bad thing is, I feel ‘wrong’ slating his behaviour, as I always hear about how good he’s been to the department, and how ‘kind-hearted’ he is. He once sent me a link to a website selling lots of luxury scarves as he’d noticed how ‘many lovely scarves’ I seemed to wear, and although one lady in my office thought it was strange, the other ladies thought it was ‘sweet’ of him to do that for me. The other admin ladies say apparently he’s always been ‘a ladies man’, but I don’t think they know how uncomfortable it makes me. I’m not going to say anything, as he’s been in that department for 40+ years. I just try to be around other people whenever he’s present, so he can’t say anything. "
"An old man who was in my workplace commented to a team member ‘I would be scared to make love to her, she might break’. When is that appropriate? I’m a human who is more then just someone to be objectified. How is this okay? "
"One of my male co-workers cornered me in a tiny kitchen at work and told me how he’d like to cover me in BBQ sauce and eat me. Seeing my horrified expression, he said he would use mustard or sweet ‘n’ sour if I preferred. This same man will shake my boyfriend’s hand and laugh and chat with him. My boyfriend has no idea that this type of incident is a very regular occurence for me at work and I havn’t told him as I don’t want to make him worried for me or stressed. "
"In a senior meeting this week, and the chair(man) having asked a question of a female manager, replies with ‘When will you just give me a straight answer, woman.’ While the challenge was not pleasant, it was the ‘woman’ at the end that was alarming. No male colleagues reacted. But I admit to being so shocked, I could give nothing more than a withering look at the time. Challenge from two women in the room is just beginning. "
"I’m an entrepreneur, and I have three partners, the three of them guys. For some reason two of them believe that speaking of girls like if they were steaks is okay… Also, one of them just won’t stop telling me that I should smile less, or that I can’t touch someone that I know, or that I cannot say hello the way I do because in his eyes “I look unprofessional” or I look “like a baby girl”. Sometimes I think that this fellow wants a cutesy goodlooking and keep-her-mouth-shut assistant. Even tough I am the CEO of my own company. "
"Recently whitest showing a group of 6 business men around at work one of them asked to have a picture with me (odd) he then slipped his arm around my waist and loudly proclaimed that if he was 10 years younger he would. All the other men heard, none said anything. He then kissed me on both cheeks and walked off, I am sad to say I said nothing. "
"Recently I was sitting on a plane waiting for it to take off when the pilot announced that the engine was having some technical problems and was unable to take off but not to worry as an engineer was on had and would be along to fix the problem very shortly. Sure enough the engineer arrived, two men behind me looking out the window burst out laughing upon noticing that the person who had arrived to fix the engine was a woman. They continued with insults such as “aw go be a gentleman and ask her if you can hold her handbag for her while she fixes it” or “lets go and ask her is she needs a hand”. Well she fixed it and in about half an hour we were off, I hope they learned a simple lesson that day, but, I doubt the did sadly. "
"I was one of 3 women on a 12 person management board. Whenever the (female) PA was away, one of the 3 of us was asked to take the minutes. The boss didn’t even realise he was doing it until I refused and asked why one of the men couldn’t take the minutes? The male board members there were very quick to offer then but they just hadn’t realised. "
Doctor colleague at distant location ignored my assertion that files were not available to me on hard drive. I put him on speaker phone to do screen shots quickly to illustrate my point. Colleague manner continues to be belittling and derisive on phone. I switch off speaker phone. Patient watches on as I try to manage situation with dismay on my behalf. Ends up I am right. Colleague asks to speak to patient and apologises for ‘ mix up ‘ and inconvenience to him. Patient gives phone back to me. Colleague hangs up. Patient appalled and shakes his head. Says ‘ the guys a dickhead’. I can only agree. But he is a secretly sexist dickhead in a male dominated profession and business. Makes me so in awe of women who have succeeded . My manager and her manager commiserate but give me no help in addressing complaint. Suggest I talk to a petite doctor who is his junior and has no administrative power but is ‘ the clinical lead’ in the region. Wtf grievance process is that? Sheesh. 
"I was walking into the kitchen at work to make a cup of tea behind two of my male colleagues, I was the last to be seen entering the room. Another male colleague already in the kitchen said, to the two guys in front, ‘Hello ladies’. Then when he saw me he added ‘…and lady’. When I said I was confused as I was indeed a woman, but the others weren’t, he explained ‘It was an insult to the guys, then just a hello to you’. This guy is actually lovely, we always chat for a bit if we meet in the kitchen. He is married with a young daughter who he adores. Perhaps that’s why I was driven to writing this… because somehow, despite this he is still completely unaware of what he’s actually saying / doing. I then came back to my desk to catch a comment by another male colleague when he was describing a guy that was getting frustrated about having to work whilst the football was on. He described him as having a ‘Bitch-fit’. No one blinked. Why is it that reference to females is used so much as an insult? I am so tired of it. ‘…..this, that, and the other… like a girl’ You hear it all the time. Will this ever stop when it’s so normalised? I’m in my late 30s and I find it upsetting and annoying and I will say something, but what about young girls? And boys? When a father, a decent guy, says something like this without even realising it, what message does that send to youngsters? And what chance do we have of stopping it? I can only think that we should be addressing it in schools, it should be part of the curriculum… Just wanted to share with an audience who gets it. Have a lovely day peeps. "
"I’ve been sexually harassed in many jobs… When I worked in the cafeteria of a very well-known corporate law firm in London, the chefs would wolf-whistle and make noises every time I walked in or out of the kitchen. It was so humiliating but I was 22 and too shy to say anything. In my next job, the CEO told me I would look good in a corset. The job after that, a colleague 25 years older than me sent me emails telling me how sexy I was looking. In another job…. I was asked if I give oral sex (because his wife doesn’t anymore) in front of the majority of my co-workers, and was asked, again in front of the majority of my co-workers, if I watch porn, “I bet you watch lesbian porn don’t you”. I turned down another job because the interviewer made a point of looking at my breasts during the interview. Now, I live and teach abroad. In the last month I have caught a student making sexual gestures at me behind my back, one discussing vibrators in class (which I am sure would not have happened if the teacher was a man) and one writing in an exam that “people find technology difficult to understand, especially women”. On top of that, I am wolf-whistled and kissed at by the security guards at my workplace every morning and evening as I enter and leave the building. Now, I’m old enough to know to say something. In the UK, my sister has just been advised by her boss to start wearing make up again because “i didn’t employ you for your brain”. "
"I downloaded and listened to your interview with Victoria Derbyshire on 5live. I was appalled at some of the stories I heard. I am a 52 year old femininst who has, sadly, over the years had to let go of my dream of a living in a country where men and women are treated and SEEN as equal. Even now I am treated ‘differently’ because I am female. I am asked in work ”do I need help” in things much more than a male colleague. I receive comments on my appearance which would not happen to male colleagues, assumptions are made about my life because of my gender. Surely it is time for men to SEE women as equal and for women to refuse to ‘play’ the female role to get their needs met. My personal expereince of everyday sexism range from calls from men in the street, sexist ‘jokes’ by managers in the workplace, hardest of all I would suggest is lack of support from other females. "
"A male coworker, let’s call him L, was discussing this other male coworker, let’s call him G. So G is married to a woman, and has a couple of kids, and they are apparently having trouble finding reliable childcare. So occasionally the wife will take time off, and occasionally the husband will, in order to pick up their kids. So L’s comment was that “G’s wife decided she wanted to work, so now he has to take time off work to deal with this childcare situation.” How do I even start on how sexist this is? First of all, BOTH parents are working to support the family, and BOTH parents are compromising to make it work. So how is it the wife’s fault? And I don’t know who “decided they want to work”, you HAVE to work in order to make money to survive. They probably needed two incomes. "
"Creepy customer of handy.com, the cleaning agency “The husband was being weird with the cleaner, staring at her and following her round, trying to touch her. Obviously we told her not to go back but he started calling her. We had to ring him and tell him to stop.” That’s it, he just gets asked to stop. No other comeback. "
"I’m a man who values respect. A younger male coworker called me “the booty man” in front of two female workers when I walked into the break room today. I did not appreciate being introduced like that, and it made me feel disrespected. I know that I should have confronted him, but the comment made me feel so off guard that I yielded to him as soon as he started to show signs of remorse. I should have grunted at him and said “Hey! don’t use that word on me. Do you understand? I am your co worker, and you will show me respect. Got it?”. Instead I just became disinterested, and probably encouraged him to repeat his behavior. "
"Some years ago I started a new job. One of my colleagues was an older woman, about 50. I was 26. For the first six weeks I worked there she pinched my backside and groped me every time I went into the room she worked in. It was unpleasant being groped by a woman who was old enough to be my mother. Some years later I told this story to some female colleagues, they thought it was hilarious. "
"I’m a mechanical engineer, which for anyone who doesn’t know is an overwhelmingly male-dominated field. Here are some school and work related sexism stories. Engineering School: When I worked in the machine shop, the supervisors would hover behind me whenever I used any tool. I never asked them for help beyond occasionally asking where things were stored and was always both competent and responsible. They also frequently said things like “wow, that was actually pretty good” in a tone of surprise when I did simple things correctly. No one over the age of six deserves that kind of remark for using a hand drill properly. In the engineering computer lab, men would make incredibly sexist or perverted remarks about women when I was there. They would stop if another woman came into the room-I never did find out if they did this whenever there was only one woman in the lab, or only if that one woman was me. I could not work on assignments with male peers without my presence being perceived as sexual interest. Work: Identically (and frequently less) qualified male peers had far more interviews and job offers than I did At one job interview, I was taken aside and asked “whether I liked it deep or whether I liked it wide” by a middle aged, native English speaking man. When I looked affronted, he asked me six more times. I was offered the job. At a school sponsored recruiting event, a company recruiter winked at me and said creepy things. I was also offered that job. At a trainee position on a submarine base, I shadowed a meeting with my mentor, who was a 28 year old woman who had been an engineer there for six years and who was regarded as the best young engineer in her department. Her supervisor (a man) was delayed with a flat tire. She went to the meeting alone, and was harangued, insulted, and belittled by six older men until she left. Then she cried in the back stairwell. Everything she said was correct according to navy engineering protocol. At that same position, I was sexually harassed and followed around by both sailors and coworkers. I was told upon leaving that I was only hired because I was female. At my next position, I was hired and told I would be working on a machine shop floor building parts. On my first day, I was informed that I would actually be in the shipping department packing boxes. The six male new hires,all younger and with less shop experience than me, were given positions building parts. I was addressed as dear, darling, or sweetheart daily. "
"A couple here. When I was 16 I worked for a fast food chain, with a drive through. I used to have to run the food out. A colleague (aged 32) told me cars slowed down or stopped completely, to watch ‘my boobs bounce’. So creepy and made me so insecure about my body. Age 17. I was working at a theme park and had spent the day paired with a guy who would not stop staring at my ass. I called him out on it, and to his credit he apologised. But that night a different colleague spoke to me. We had never spoken before, but I complained to him about my day. He offered to kiss it better, and when I straight out told him no his reply was ‘hug?’ I then told my dad about all of this. His reply? ‘It’s just boys being boys’ ‘Take is as a compliment’ ‘They just think you’re pretty’ There are far better ways to think or express that I am pretty. My body does not give them the excuse to act how they like. Age 19. I was working at a local restaurant. My manager thinks it was perfectly okay to great me ‘hey big tits’ Age 20. Walking home from a friend’s house, around 11pm at night. A guy thinks it is completely okay to loudly harass me from across the street. My reply? An equally loud ‘Fuck Off’ Catcalls are not and never will be a compliment, They are scary and intimidating. "
"I’m a receptionist, and my desk is smack bang in the middle of the office, away from all other desks. Basically I sit on my own. I’m also not allowed to leave my desk unless it is for a designated reason within my job. This is so I can be around to answer the phone. I understand all of this. What I don’t understand is why I was the one who was told off when men come chat/flirt with me when I am glued to my desk. And none of these men have had a word said to them. How odd? I wonder why. "
"I work in a popular sandwich shop. We treat men and woman the same allways ask what can I get you love, darling that kind of thing. It’s hot as hell your in a baseball cap and waffle knit shirt jeans stood on your feet 9 hours with toasters and ovens directly behind you and not alot of room to move you can’t have makeup on or nails painted and because of the heat your sweaty shatterd and doing 20 things at once. All this is fine Untill you get the customers who point all this out not to the men who work there (wich are lovley and also know how hot it is) but we get told to make an effort it does nothing for our look. Wich is a pain in the arse. 2 days ago I was going out shopping I had MY clothes on not uniform my hair how I usually have it for day where nothing special no effort like going out makeup done. I was called in to quickly do some paper work upon seeing me a regular who comments often loudly comments Jesus look at you how come you don’t allways look like this I’d well give you a servicing ( wtf am I a car) to wich him and his cohorts laugh loudly. Wich then made the vast majority feel that it was OK to comment on how different I look from “work mess” to usually evryday dossing about no effort. Think next time I’ll make an effort just to watch them have a heart attack because they way they acted it’s the only logical next step. "
"Today my female coworker who is senior to me told me I needed to speak in lower tones when trying to get a point across to men in our industry and be taken seriously, because my voice is too high. She said I’m not forceful enough and I’m a pushover because my voice is high. My voice is not all that high. She then proceeded to ask if I’m bulimic. I’m not, but if I were, would I tell her? Sexism in the workplace is almost somehow worse when it comes from a female coworker. "
"I have a very different story to tell. Im a happily married man for 20 years and my wife and I both work in the corporate world. I have seen my wife being discriminated at the workplace merely because she “cannot cope with the stress the promotion will put her in” over and over. I have in my work , being in a decision making position , been doing the opposite – namely giving women slight precedence in hiring , salary increases , promotions , etc. This has had the effect of enraging some of my staff and colleagues and I have been accused officially and unofficially of varying degrees of sexual misconduct including having affairs with several of the women. On the contrary there have been several occassions where I have confronted some of my colleagues for making inappropriate comments/actions with some of the female staff. I have been constantly accused of handing out promotions and pay hikes in return for sexual privileges. Its amazing that there is not a single documented case of such by any of the female employees. This has reached a tempo so loud that I was lately “laid off” due to “reorganization” and am having a hard time finding another job being labelled a skirt chaser. There were no words minced when I was told “off the record” that the reason for my lay off was that I had brought in and promoted so many women that the workplace was rapidly becoming a “sorority house” . The financial records showed exemplary returns in the areas where I had worked but an overall “reorganization” has resulted my lay off. There are other men out there who feel and think like me. I know them and count some of them as close friends but they are apparently smarter and dont go around overtly carrying the message. "
Two years into my social work career i was changing to another team. I spent two weeks showing my replacement the work (hospital social work). He was newly qualified and had been a photographer previously whereas i had worked in adult care and with children with disabilities. At the end of the two weeks he told me he was starting on a higher salary than me. When my boss came to say goodbye to me I challenged him and he said it was because my replacement was a “family man”. He added that he thought i had it in me to eventually become a senior practitioner (thanks you patronising git). At this time I was a single parent with two young children and my replacement had just left his wife and child and was living in the nurses’ accommodation. I was so angry I had to leave the room and stay away from my office until he left about 30 minutes later. Some years later when I became a team manager he rang the chair of the interview panel and asked her was she sure she had made the right decision? She was furious and told me about it. In social work men move quickly into management positions and recruit in their own image. 
"I work in a majority female profession at a university and have not really had to deal with daily, repeated sexist behavior before. I have not had a problem with any of my male colleagues. But now I have a new boss’s boss that is sexist – examples of soft/subtle sexism happen multiple times every day. My male colleagues are also seeing it for what it is and together we are trying to navigate how to handle it. Here are a few examples of what I have experienced: 1) I was in a conference room at work waiting for people to show up to a committee meeting. My new boss’s boss (male) and a male colleague were already in the room. I had my laptop open as I was trying to meet a deadline and needed to keep an eye on email as I was watching for an update from a student employee. I was also opening documents to reference during the meeting as I had a number of items I wanted to discuss. The boss’s boss looks at my male colleague and then over at me and then asks me to take notes. I gave him a cold stare but agreed (in hindsight, I have a lot of things I wish I had said instead). I took the shittiest notes because (a) I was trying to be an active member of the meeting (taking notes gets in the way of participation), (b) I had important topics I wanted to discuss (with documents that I needed to reference up at on my laptop screen…no room for the doc to take notes on that screen), (c) I was trying to meet a deadline, (d) I needed to assist a student employee via email and, (e) his request told me that he did not see me as an equally valued member of this committee. Sure, someone needs to take notes at the meetings. This should be handled by asking for a volunteer at the start of the meeting with the understanding that this duty will be rotated among the group. Don’t just ask the woman in the room. I’m not your damn secretary! I have two master’s degrees. 2) I was reporting about a donation at a meeting the other day and he cut me off, laughed a little in amusement, and said “that was cute.” WTF? I was just stating a fact about this donor in order to provide him with some background information. Would he interrupt my male colleague to say what he reported “was cute”?!? 3) Near the beginning of a dept. meeting, a male colleague mentioned that he needed to leave our meeting early to meet with a professor so we saved agenda items that did not concern him for the end of the meeting. When we got to that point in the agenda, the male colleague quietly got up to leave. This is when my female boss was in the middle of asking my boss’s boss about our work priorities on a project I am involved with. Boss’s boss doesn’t even acknowledge my boss is speaking – he just jumps up and hurriedly follows out after our male colleague while asking a question about football. Another female colleague and I stared at each other in disbelief, told our boss what just happened (because she was referencing items on her computer screen and didn’t see how he ignored her and left), I yelled out the conference room at our boss’s boss “The meeting isn’t over!” while my female colleague yells “[Boss’s name] was in the middle of an important question!” Boss’s boss barely acknowledged us… just waved his hand at us saying “oh yeah..in a minute” while continuing to speak with our male colleague about football… I have lost all respect for this man as a professional, as a leader, and as a human being. All of my interactions with him are now seen through this lens. I am getting tired of having to amplify my voice so that he won’t interrupt me (he still does but I just keep speaking loudly to finish my thought) while male colleagues can finish their thoughts. Then whatever boss’s boss says in “response” to me proves to me that he was still not listening to a word I said. I just leave meetings frustrated instead of ready to tackle a project. There are more examples that I could add. I am fortunate that I have my boss as an ally. We are unlucky because my boss’s boss constantly ignores us, interrupts us, disregards our experiences and opinions, and clearly does not value us as much as our dept’s male colleague (the male colleague is fully aware of what is happening, is an ally, and is also trying to help us figure out how to navigate it. It’s his boss’s boss as well. We recognize the uncomfortable positions we are both in when dealing with a superior. We reflect about these experiences of soft sexism and try to figure out how we can handle it better next time…) "
"My story relates to an incident at work in 2012. I was in the canteen with a more senior member of staff, with a management position. We were talking generally, when he asked me to have an affair with him… I refused obviously and said I was going to bring it to the attention of his line manager… "
"Giving a presentation to 3 sales teams at work as the youngest member of the team, and a trainee. I felt it went quite well, I asked my manager’s manager for feedback afterwards and he said ‘you lost me once you took your jacket off, I could only look at your chest’. IN FRONT OF COLLEAGUES who acted as though he’d said something ordinary. Later on I told my manager. He advised me to keep it to myself as a big HR investigation would be bad for my career, I’d be ‘moved on’ and I’d be known for challenging management. I said nothing but hated them all after that.

Just seen the new drink & drive campaign in the UK. Apparently all women are shameless harlots who don’t let men drink and if they do we force them to drive and get prosecuted. Simply sexist and disgustingly victim shaming 
"As a teen I had a summer job where one day I was told by to take care of task that required a lot of calculating and problem solving. I was specifically asked to handle it by one of the owners of the place, because she trusted me to get it right. Some guy my age was made my helping hand to do the physical labor. When we were almost done, the male owner came by and wanted to be briefed about how things had been done. He asked something from the guy helping me, who naturally turned to me for the correct numbers. Even so, the owner kept talking to the guy while I kept reading out the numbers and explaining what they meant. Satisfied, the owner then thanked the guy for a job well done and glancing at me said: “It’s nice you have gotten yourself a secretary”. Then he walked away. "

"When I try and state the facts about a topic, some men will interrupt me and talk over me. A male relative interrupted me and talked over me while I was about a petition I signed regarding the woman who was sent home from work for wearing high heels. He didn’t listen to me. He asked me if I really had all the facts or if the woman was making up the story just to get attention. He basically said that if the woman didn’t like the terms of work or the dress code, she should go get a new job. Then he denied that the story was real claiming that high heels were dangerous to wear on the tube, so the story must be made up. He then said that men are forced to wear protective clothing when on a building site as a work requirement so people have to wear what their employer tells them to wear to work. I tried to explain that hard hats, reflective jackets and steel capped boots are meant to protect people from accidents at work, and these don’t hurt or permanently damage feet like high heels do. He interrupted me again, this time backed up by a female relative saying that women have the choice to wear whatever shoes they like to work as long as they look smart. I tried to explain that the woman was told to wear high heels to work and was again dismissed and talked over. The male relative basically said that male dress codes and terms of work are unfair too. He did raise the good point that one company used to require the males not to marry so that they could work abroad and he thought this was incredibly unfair, but he said it was up to the employer to state the terms of work. If workers didn’t like the terms of work, he suggested they get a new job with terms they did actually like. He didn’t listen to me at all and talked about himself and his work. He wouldn’t let me finish my sentences and he said I worried too much about silly trivial things. I watch some men speak. They can interrupt and be taken seriously by other people. When I have tried to speak up about issues, some men and women have claimed that I talk too much. When I just started talking, I was told to be quiet and stop “interrupting” by mental health workers who didn’t listen to me state the facts. One male actually called me a “whiny baby” when I was trying to express an opinion. So sick and tired of not being respectfully listened to. I am a woman. I try and listen to what other people have to say. I wish some of them would offer me the same courtesy. "
Overhearing a colleague and the manager discussing the colleagues wife’s breasts. 
"I arrived at work a few days ago and immediately, one of my male co-workers who is younger than me loudly asked me if I would be causing any more “drama” today. What drama was he referring to you ask? A few days previously, I suddenly had to go from work to hospital for immense pain that transpired to be kidney stones. For anyone reading that that doesn’t know, it’s widely agreed that the pain of kidney stones is second only to the pain of child birth. My co-worker trivialised this pain as “drama” and, having worked with him the past few months and seeing his general mannerisms, I know for a fact he would never speak to another man so disrespectfully. Everyone else at work was genuinely relieved to see I had recovered. A few moments later, during morning coffee, this same 23 year old boy got very VERY angry at another man that I work with over the trivial matter of watching television. He was irrationally angry, practically shouting at him that a 30 year old man who wants to work and have a life etc etc should have more sense than to watch TV and how childish watch TV is etc. The man at whom he was shouting objected and said “Tarry watches TV. . . “. The response to this? “Yeah, but she is a woman”. Yes, because as we all know, women preoccupy themselves with the childish, silly things in life. "
"I am a very interested (male) reader of this site, but I can’t help but be struck how asymmetric it is. Women are objectified in all kinds of objectionable ways, this is clear. But the fact is that women objectify men as well, and I don’t think you can understand the one objectification without the other. Just to take one example: I am friends with a number of well-educated and successful women who think of themselves as feminists. Yet they will do things like (1) complain that they can’t find any good guys to date because they wouldn’t dream of dating someone who makes less than they do or whose career is lower-status than theirs; or (2) flatly state that they couldn’t date a man shorter than themselves. So I suppose at the end of the day I can feel some relief that I’m not just a pretty face or pair of legs. I’m not getting catcalled or assaulted. But it’s pretty clear that (at least on some level) I *am* a bank account balance and a height. Being tall and relatively successful, it doesn’t bother me too much, but perhaps it should bother me more. And I can only imagine how I’d respond to such comments if I was neither. "
"Several things annoy me about my current work place. I work with more women than men. My 52 year old male boss calls me ‘babes’ – my partner doesn’t even call me babes. Why do men feel the need to determine whether I can lift a box that they think is too heavy for me? I know my limits, I know how heavy is too heavy for me to safely pick up, if I need help I’ll ask for it! They just jump in and say “its ok I’ll get that its heavy!” I’m not a delicate flower that needs protected! Just let me do it! They have no idea how much weight I can lift! Really gets to me! What annoys me more is the other women I work with who won’t even try to lift a box they think might be heavy because that’s the men’s’ job. I will walk into a room of men and if the conversation is deemed ‘less than ladylike’ the conversation stops, it’s so awkward, If the conversation is inappropriate for the workplace you don’t have it.

"I’ve read 25 pages of these stories and I’m starting to feel numb with the horror. I realized that I’m grateful that the kind of sexism I’ve had hasn’t been violently physical and more of the subvert, subtle kind. The fact that I’m grateful for that just brings up a whole different kind of horror. "
"When I was in six grade we had “Study Hall,” It was when we ate our lunches in a classroom and do homework. So one day after lunch a volunteered to help our teacher clean up.

"Attended a court hearing the other day in which I made lengthy legal submissions and I won on every issue – despite this, my male opponent felt it necessary when walking to the train station after court to walk on the pavement’s outside, and explained it was because he was “old-fashioned”….because my lady-brain makes it more likely that I’ll become hysterical and run into traffic, presumably.

"Been an engineer since 1980. Dropped out of grad school “the first time around” because my advisor tried to get into my pants. Endured through “What’s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?” and “Ron and his girl are coming over”…and the guy who grabbed my arm forcefully to make a point. What helped was our women’s group and a couple of bosses who believed in me “You’re good, and you’ll be better when you understand how good you are.” (Including said “Ron”). Did well anyway. Some of the companies where I’ve worked prided themselves in non-discrimination against women, some were fairly neutral. Went to grad school the second time because “Dr. X” clarified that I was an engineer whereas “Ms. X” could be any role. (I was talking to Dr. Z, a Hispanic women, who pointed out without the “Dr.” she was often assumed to be the hotel maid!) Still doing well, still suffering sexism (more dismissal of my ideas, and being overtalked, than harassment). I figure I’ve accomplished what I have needed to, maybe not as much as equally competent men my age, but they didn’t have the hurdles I had–they had bosses and coworkers and clients who believed in them and gave them progressive roles without them having to ask. They were considered management material and guided into it whereas I was considered “not management material” and shuffled aside. So now I’m into being competent, being thorough, doing what I’d promised I’d do, and enjoying my non-work life as much as I can. What are they going to do, fire me? I’ve got enough money to retire now, I just choose not to. I ask for what I want, tell what I’m thinking, and only rarely get nightmares about them coming after me with guns. ðŸ™? I hope the younger women have it easier. It’d be nice if they recognized it was harder for me, but since their male colleagues don’t have to recognize that, I wouldn’t want to burden the women. "
"Was at doing volunteer work today when a male volunteer grinned and said “Good Morning!”. I replied “good morning”. He followed up what he said with the comment: “That’s women’s work right!” I was stunned at his tactless remark. His female aide crossly took him aside and told him not to be so rude, telling him to get on with his own job. I have worked and studied with people with learning disabilities. In fact people have claimed in the past that I seemed learning disabled (I struggled with school). This isn’t a rant against learning disabled people, in fact I have met many such people who have been polite and kind. However, I have noticed that some of the men with learning disabilities that I have met have used the phrase “That’s women’s work” far too often. I wonder whether time spent teaching these people “self esteem” would in fact be better spent educating them about the wide variety of people that do different jobs. Also about respecting others. Schools could also do better at showing students the variety of people that go to work. Education is essential here and sadly lacking in many institutions. The place I work at has volunteer work available for all kinds of people, disabled and abled bodied. The man who made the tactless comment, must have walking round with his eyes closed (or at least not paying attention) because I have male colleagues from the departments I work in who do exactly the same tasks that I do often on the same day! Go to any theme park or family attraction and you’ll see people of all genders sweeping, picking up litter, heavy lifting and (rather unglamorously) unblocking drains. Yes women unblock drains too. It’s smelly and nasty, but has to be done. It is sad also when toy aisles sell doctors’ outfits to the boys and nurses’ outfits to the girls. Yes female doctors and male nurses exist: I’ve met them and they do good work! Instead of talking about “women’s work” or “men’s work” why don’t we just talk about “people work”? "
"I used to work at a major medical center. I was a low-level administrator (we can say Level 1). After being there for a few years, I asked to have the job/salary upgraded to Level 2, based on the level work I was doing (which was, in fact, the stuff my boss was supposed to be doing himself). I could document it. It was refused, which I chalked up to institutional pinch-penny. Then, 6 months later, I moved and had to quit. My replacement was a young man from our department. They immediately changed the job to Level 2 and paid him 50% more than I had made. He told me. "
"“Your period is a financial burden on the organisation,” Obviously, this story is a long one, but that was the crux of the matter. I sat across the table from the narcissistic female manager who delighted in victimising young, intelligent, articulate women, and was stunned. The statement hadn’t come from her. It had come from the seemingly reasonable female Human Resources manager. I had poured all my energy into my work. I was very good at it, and the data and the feedback reflected that. It was the reason my manager had been gaslighting and bullying me for the past three years, along with anyone else who showed the slightest sign of intelligence; seven resignations in three years tells it’s own tale. I had come to expect that from her. I wasn’t prepared for the HR woman. She frowned at me. “Can’t you just take some panadol?” she asked. It was clearly not the time to point out that I had been given five different kinds of painkiller and advised to take them all at once, and to pop in to the hospital for morphine where necessary. One doctor had described my pain as ‘worse than labour’. I came to work on all the days when I could stand upright, and really only missed a couple of days every few months due to inexplicable primary dysmenorrhea. The fact that I was very good at my job was irrelevant. My manager wanted me gone. Union delegates told me that it was ludicrous; she couldn’t fire me for having bad periods. They missed the point. She had never wanted to fire me. She wanted me to resign. She had made my life a living hell. She made no secret of the fact that men were her favourite kind of human, and it was widely acknowledged that if you were young, female, and capable, you were top of the ‘who to victimise today’ list. She sucked the joy out of my dream job. But all the gaslighting and manipulation, all the overt and covert bullying, all the times she backed me into a corner or told me I was inadequate vanished in the moment that the Human Resources woman spoke. This was a woman who didn’t know me. I did resign. I really had no choice. I have now been symptom free for several months. Perhaps this condition vanished as mysteriously as it appeared. Or perhaps it is significant that it started after I began working for a woman who enjoys victimising other women. I have no way of knowing for sure. It was never a situation I could resolve. Countless others have tried and failed. My only consolation is that it was not my manager that tipped me into resignation; it was the sexism of a woman I didn’t know. "
"I was working for a company in a medical sales position. I had achieved several sales awards, promotion to sales trainer and leadership roles. I relocated with the company with a new boss. He made comments to me “I will smack you on the hand”, “I will kick you under the table”, made ” hot MILF” comments in front of me and a customer. Another manager kissed me on the cheek in a middle of my business meeting with the already sexist manager I reported to. Then I was assigned a other new manager that stated “I should handle it like a man” I corrected him and said “You mean like a woman” He said “no like a man, women cry” Other comments of “You will be my most high maintenance rep” and “You need to get your mind straight” “I can see you mud wrestling” and other comments of sexist nature. I reported it to my old manager and the manager above him told me I needed “perspective” and it is a “saddened place” I then received retaliation with bullying and harassment with workplace mobbing. Prank calls stating “are you in the witnesses protection program?” and hang ups. Dark video sent to me with death threats and showing a man acting like biting into a woman’s leg like cannibalism. I was fired eith no prior disciplinary actions. I worked there for 4 years and 7 months. Post employment I filed with EEOC and filed a lawsuit. I have had vandalism, stalking, phone and computer hacking, death threats and private investigators stalking and surveliancing me. I have been blAcklisted in and outside of my field and have been out of my sales career for two years. Manager contActed other employees and lost several job offers. Law enforcement does nothing about stalking cause the mangers son is in law enforcement. I filed the lawsuit pro we because they have interfered for me to get a lawyer.

"I’m 16 and when I was walking to and from work in shorts, 2 or 3 cars had beeped at me or men catcalled me. This annoyed me so much and this happens to me even when I don’t wear shorts and when i’m just casually walking in public. "
"My one friend is now older, but she used to be a welder. Her husband is also in construction, but works different sorts of jobs, so lots of times she is in a totally different crew/company/jobsite. She told me the men NEVER let up on her. Treated her like she was a pariah and made comments about her and her work all the time. She’s small to boot, so they mostly tower over her. One of the projects was to work on a water intake at a power plant. To do the work, the water was turned off in the tunnel. My friend was the welder on-site, so she crawled into the intake and got busy doing her job. After awhile she heard something–rumbles–that made her want to crawl back out, so she did. The men had turned the water back on. They thought it would be funny. Her take was that they might have killed her. Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha. "
"Age 13-17 – at secondary school being told i was not sexy because I had a flat chest, but still being groped by one boy throughout each day. Age 13, Being told I was dirty for being on my period when two school boys found spare sanitary towels in my jacket and spread the word around class Age 15 – first time I had sex, my boyfriend tossed me a Â£20 note and said ‘thanks for that, love’. Apparently he was joking. Age 18 – working in a restaurant, a drunk arrogant man rubs his hand on my bum in front of my co workers and punters Age 18 â€“ When I travelled to India alone, my travel partner couldn’t come at the last minute and my then boyfriend (due to leave the country sooner after) suggested I travel with a friend he’d picked up along his 3 month trip, an Indian man called Balla. Balla was abusive and wouldn’t let me travel without him, citing emotional frailty as his reasons, how I must look after him. I woke up one night to find Balla groping me. I thought it was a bad dream. Alone in India. I eventually ran away from Balla, saved by an American woman called Sarah. Age 18 â€“ as an au pair in Italy the father, Paulo weighed me on my first day, declaring that I ‘look good now, but wait till we’re finished with you’. Paulo touched my feet at the family dinner table with his own, while asking me about my boyfriend. My boyfriend was Jewish and my brother in law black, he said the boyfriend should be ‘gassed alive’ and the black brother expelled from our family. Paulo was a fascist and a misogynist. He’d tell me of his fantasy of sex with twin sisters, showing me photos of naked lady friends on his phone. There was also a camera in my room. Age 18-21 – working in a bar, the manager who hired me assaulted me on a daily basis. Sometimes lifting my skirt and rubbing my bum and thighs with his hands, sometimes catching me out back to press his erect penis against my pelvis, sometimes following me downstairs when getting ice to tell me in private how hard he wanted to fuck me. When I would tell him to go away he’d say ‘fuck you, I’m married, you’re tits are too small anyway’ Age 18 – My then boyfriend and supposed close friend (a guy) thought it’d be funny to hold me down on the bed while my other supposed good friend (another guy) slapped me on my face with his penis until it went hard. Nothing can describe the shame I felt, how confused I felt when they all laughed at me and told me it was a joke. Age 23 – Raped twice by my then boyfriend after he made me feel like it was my ‘duty’ as a girlfriend, to prove I still loved him. Iâ€™d argue with him, but lay still while he had sex with me. Iâ€™d cry alone in the bath after. Age 26 – told to come back to a meeting once Iâ€™d applied makeup by the vice president at the company I work at. Apparently he was joking too, and apparently Iâ€™d embarrassed him by walking away. Age 26 – harassed by a partner to the company I work for at a business dinner, and asked if I would ever cheat on my boyfriend while he rubbed his hands through my hair. My director looked on, smiling. Told by colleagues that Iâ€™d ‘taken one for the team’. Yesterday – told to smile by a man in the street. And on, and on, and onâ€¦ "
"I was the only female in my paramedic class. I had to be the best or I was teased. even when I scored the highest on tests I was picked on. If I complained it was because ‘women can’t take a joke. Even my instructor told me ‘women shouldn’t be paramedics because they aren’t strong enough to intubate.’ In my paramedic in my paramedic internship I was teased constantly. I was told that I would be a better paramedic if I took better care of myself, ate less, lost weight and wore makeup. I was even sexually harrassed. Working as a paramedic I was told I was getting by in life because I was cute. People are genuinely surprised when I know what I’m talking about. Like I passed all my training by just being female. I’m critiqued in the workplace first and foremost based on my appearance as if that determines my ability to perform the job. I have also been told that I can’t take a joke and am too easily upset by comments. This is a male dominated field. Women have to work twice as hard to be considered half as good. I’m exhausted and it is harder and harder to laugh at the ‘jokes’ I am surrounded by everyday. Despite my experience and knowldege I am not respected. I feel like I am the problem. But I will not stand silent anymore. I can’t. "
A friend’s fast food workplace makes the girls take the orders while the boys put the food together out the back. 
"At work a week ago I was returning a carton of milk to the dairy case. I was wearing my hair in pigtail braids because it’s too thick to do much else with it. Well, an old man I passed saw me and felt the need to call out, “A milkmaid!” I’ve since switched to a different, older-looking hairstyle, not because of that alone but because I am harassed at work SO MUCH that I’ve come to expect it every time I go in, and I suspect it’s due to both being female and my youthful appearance. Oh, and a few weeks ago a male customer stopped and stared at me for several seconds after his transaction was done, then left saying sarcastically, “Keep smiling.” I don’t go to work to smile and look pretty. I go to do my job and earn money. That’s IT. "
So we’re having a training session in Entrepreneurship a day Strategic Planning. I’m one of the consultations the University (in Jamaica) hired to facilitate the workshop. Just as I’m about to begin the session with my group (a group of about 5 persons from a community group) one of the men interrupts me. Him: Can I ask you favour? Me: Sure. (thinking it was related to the topic). Him: Can you fix me a cup of coffee? The rest of the group is either laughing from embarrassment or shaking their heads. So instead of just ignoring him or insulting him (like I would usually do to men who are so rude) I decided to ask him why he asked me that favour. I had expected him to say something reasonable or even lazy like ‘oh you’re closer to the table’ or ‘I don’t know how to make coffe’. But instead he says “Oh me like when woman make my coffee.” I was so irritated. Not only with the fact that he was wasting my time but the fact that he thought it was OK to interrupt my session to reduce me to his maid. I became further irritated when a group member told me to ignore him because was on the driver (ie – wasn’t even a part of the class). I was the most educated person in the room but he wanted to reduce me to a server all because ‘he liked when women made his coffe’. #GetOnMyLevel 
"Working in a male-dominated environment, a client made a sexist remark and my colleagues laughed. I brought this to the attention of the founding partner (a man), who played the shocked and disappointed card. Knowing full well that he was part of the problem, I suggested we open a discussion with all staff members on the topic of everyday sexism and get their suggestions of how we improve it. He agreed, to keep me happy, and I sent an email out to the business to that affect. Feeling threatened and under scrutiny as a number of women started to discuss issues, from not receiving recognition of their hard work to being harassed at the Christmas party, he decided to retaliate. He responded to my request for suggestions with…. “Personally. Rather than as a partner. I’d like to think we can do this without getting boring about it and allowing for us to make jokes about the world and the funny things in it. Something about space for humour and also for recognition that people are sexual beings with desires etc… ” Consequences? He completely denied that this was inappropriate/offensive, we had a mediated session which descended into a shouting match, no change in policy, I was frozen out from interesting opportunities and ultimately had no future in the business. Six months down the line, today is my last day with that company and I am moving on to a much better opportunity. "
"On reading a news article about girls wearing shorts under their school uniform skirts to prevent boys from sexually assaulting them this morning, I was outraged and mentioned it to a colleague: her reply: “were they wearing those tiny miniskirts?” “boys will be boys, they’ve always done this” “why don’t the girls just fight back?” and even “are you sure the girls weren’t just doing it for attention?” I do not understand some people ðŸ™?

"My co-worker always came into work with a haunted expression and one day when I asked her if anything was wrong she told me about her living situation. She was in the middle of trying to move. She kept hearing horrible things through the wall from her neighbor’s apartment. Apparently her neighbor has a new boyfriend who watches her adolescent daughter. My co-worker said she heard that boyfriend say things like, ‘You’re such a pretty little girl,” and “Do you want to touch it?” She was horrified, so she tried to get her landlord involved to get the boyfriend kicked off the premises. She even banged on their door once to stop him. Apparently neither attempt worked out favorably. She wanted to help that little girl but she was also terrified because she was five foot nothing and a single woman living alone. I had to move after graduation so I never found out whatever happened to my co-worker. The constant anxiety on her face while she worked haunts me to this day. "
I work in a small team and everyone assumes my male colleague is the senior and not me. It’s really frustrating. He constantly tries to take control and talks over me in meetings. We have the same line manager who perpetuates this by working very closely with him and often excluding me from projects and meetings. 
"“Or a generation of girls who will grow up thinking that stalking means love, because of Twilight.” I’m not familiar with Twilight, so I can’t comment on that, but I have noticed other things similar to this in other TV shows. Scriptwriters for certain TV shows seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that if a man is rude/horrible to a woman, it means he likes her, & insist on writing storylines where this happens into the dramas that they’re writing for. This is beginning to really annoy me for the reason stated above. Another generation of girls who, if they watch the shows in question, will think that if a guy is rude/horrible to them, it’s because he likes them. WRONG! That couldn’t be further from the truth! Another thing that really gets my goat is when a woman stands up to a man who’s behaving in this way, she gets accused of “not being nice”, if you please. Presumably the man’s idea of ‘nice’ is her just lying down & allowing him to treat her like crap- in other words, act like a meek little woman! On a different subject, I also get extremely pissed off when women who dare to assert themselves or their authority in a team/work situation get described as ‘bossy’ or ‘pushy’, while men who do the same do not, even if they go about it in a manner that’s a damn sight more aggressive than their female counterparts, & in a manner that rubs others up the wrong way.

"Oh look! I have yet another work related story where I’ve been treated like a piece of meat and femininity has been devalued! A week or so ago, I was working and my manager came in with my colleague for the fire extinguisher. It was time for the annual check to make sure it was in perfect working order in case of an amergency. Unfortunately for me, the fire extinguisher was directly behind me. Cue my creepy manager, who could have easily just reached behind me to get the fire extinguisher, deliberately invading my personal space and rubbing his entire body up against mine. Cue him deliberately matching my evasive movements to continue rubbing up against me in this way. All the while he said, in a really “playing dumb” kind of tone, things like “oh, I HAVE to move here and here and just reach over here. . . ” when everyone present knew that he didn’t HAVE to do these things to reach the fire extinguisher, he CHOSE to do them in order to rub up against me in this very sexually harassing manner. Last week, he kept informing me that he could see my thong when I bent over. I routinely see the boxers of my male co-workers as they work, and so does he. But he never says a word to them about this. Finally, last week, I made a joke and told him he was “very pretty” because he got a new haircut. He insisted that “this word is for women” and warned me never to use it to describe him again. Cos any association with femininity is embarassing and a source of shame amirite??? Yet, no one says a word to my other male co-worker when he insists on calling me boy whenever I do any kind of heavy lifting! I guess I should be happy to be see as having some “male traits” since those are to apparently to be coveted while “female traits” are loathsome. I just remembered an incident with this second male co-worker. A few weeks ago, I was moving a few crates of PAPER CRAFT ROSES from shop to shop. This was NOT heavy in the slightest and I was told to do it. Even though I’ve proven myself capable of doing actual heavy lifting, my co-worker stops his own work to interfere with mine. On a very busy street, he suddenly appears, makes to grab all the crates off me, all while saying “what do you think you’re doing??? Give me those!”. The crates nearly fell on passers-by as I made to avoid him. I did avoid him and sharply told him to back the Hell off and to NEVER even think about doing something like that again. "
"I’ve noticed that in all of the stories most of them include or end with ” all I was wearing was e.g jeans and loose tshirt, a knee length dress, an old jumper and leggings “. Nowhere does it say in the title submit your entries of everyday sexism and a short description of what you were wearing when it happened. Clothing has NOTHING to do with sexual assault/harassment but we all do it automatically because it’s the first questions we get asked when something like this happens. ” well what we’re you wearing because if must have been revealing to provoke this behavior in a man ?” We are trying to stand up to sexism but this just reveals how we are all conditioned to the point were it is second nature to explain our dress code. Sexual assault itself isn’t enough, other people have to rule out if we provoked the attack first by the way we dressed, as if a nice dress somehow nullifies the gravity of sexual assault. Women are described all the time as walking hormone factories that can be trusted to make serious decisions are be in placed of authority and yet it the first line of defense from most men when they are called out for their behavior towards women, sk many times I have heard ” I’m just a man I’ve got all this testosterone in me and it’s what men are designed to do ” Double standards "
"I respect that some of the details being relayed here are truly horrific and my heart goes out to all of you who have suffered at the hands of perverted miscreants, however, none of these posts detail sexism. Mostly they detail sexual assault, which, whilst heartbreaking, are not examples of actual sexism. As defined: prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially : discrimination against women. This definition in my opinion seems sexist in itself… nevertheless. Having said this, many of these recounts are examples of sexism and I proudly stand by you for making others aware. As a man, I know I’m most likely unwelcome here, I’ve experienced sexism from both men and women. For instance, there was recently an available position as a babysitter in my area and I applied nice and early to ensure I had a good chance of being chosen. I have plenty of experience with babysitting, as I have done so with many of the other neighbour’s children and have completed a basic first aid course in the event that something unfortunate should ever happen. Alas, I was informed a day prior to the night that the position had been filled (I know the couple well and they’d told me I was perfect for the job up until then.) Turns out they preferred that their child be looked after by a much younger (14 compared to 17) less experienced girl, who lived a couple houses up from me. It seems clear that due to my genitals, they had an issue with me looking after their child. I have no grudge against the family, of course if they weren’t comfortable with a man doing the job, then they have full right not to hire me. Given that I’m actually friends with the couple, I just find it difficult to see why else they suddenly had a change of heart and have never let me know of future babysitting positions. Curious. "
"In my workplace there are so many sexist incidents it’s practically a mini game to spot them. I’m the only woman in the entire company so nobody else seems all that bothered. Firstly there’s the incidents that most people class as “nice” sexism – things like being constantly referred to as ‘love’ or ‘sweetheart’ instead of by my actual name – again as I’m the only woman working there you’d think this would be easy to remember, but apparently not! Another example would be the constant offers of help when visiting our building/renovation sites. Nobody offers this help to any of the men with me – why just me? I’m a woman not a freaking invaild, I can walk over a bit of mud without crying out desperately for the nearest man. Then there’s the more serious stuff, the big boss is mainly responsible for these. We had a job opening recently for a role that was meant to be assisting another member of staff – 28 women applied for this role and their CV’s were placed directly into the bin as the boss wanted a ‘young lad’ for this role. Sure enough the job was given to the only male applicant despite his having no relevant experience and so far not proving to be much use at it. I’m sure this is highly illegal but feel that I can’t make a complaint about it as being the only female employee I am easily traceable and I cannot risk getting fired. As a result of this new assistant my own job has suffered, he is now being given work that I would normally do even in instances where he is already busy and I am not. My role has now been reduced to making tea and answering the telephone – in fact when my boss wanted the new assistant to cover for a day I had booked off on leave his exact phrase was “don’t worry it’ll be easy – all we need to do is put you in a dress and pop a pretty face on you and you can do her job straight away”. When I first began working for this company I had various areas of responsibility as there was a low number of staff, I’d often be very busy and I felt valued and relied upon. Since then we have had several new hires – all male – and gradually any trace of responsibility have been taken from me and passed onto them. Most still require me to show them how to perform certain tasks and find things – I genuinely feel that this change has happened because my boss sees me as a glorified doll to smile nicely and make the tea, today he offered me lessons on waitressing as I would be clearing tables in his meeting room “a lot more often from now on” – not really the continued professional development I had in mind, why I applied for a job I was promised advancment in, or why I studied for a degree and postgrad qualification!!! The same boss also spent the best part of an hour explaining to me exactly how to use the data system I set up a few months ago (but am not allowed to continue with now as this is apparently not my job!) – when I tried to point out that I had created said syustem and knew exactly how to use it I was, for want of a better phrase, “told off” as though I was a child and told that he “didn’t want to know why something was, just keep quiet and listen to what you’re told”. I have worked for the company for a year and have not been offered any CPD or qualifications to progress, my male colleagues have been offered these things within weeks of starting employment with us. Due to the make-up of office staff a lot of conversations include topics I find uncomfortable, such as today’s discussion of one young man’s sexual adventures with a girl he referred to as a “whale”. This type of conversation sadly isn’t unusual, quite a few seem to revolve around the female body and what it should look like, shame they can’t be the woman listening from the opposite corner feeling anger on behalf of their subjects. There is simply no respect/equality for women in the language they use. Again I feel that I can’t bring this up despite it making me feel uncomfortable as the last time I tried I ended up being labelled as over-sensitive. The instance that stuck me as the worst though was actually a minor comment by a woman – a client’s wife – who referred to how awful it was to be the only girl as you “always have to make the teas and things”. This I found the most disturbing because it was a passing comment that nobody seemed to find odd – the idea that this is a woman’s place seems to be heavily ingrained in this company. Overall work has become an absolute hell as I feel I have no way of fighting back against any of these instances without putting my current and future employment at risk. This I find incredibly depressing as I have always felt able to stand up for myself during instances of “classic sexism” e.g. bottom squeezing on nights out etc. I have always been able to scream blue murder at idiots who behave this way and I don’t know how to handle having no power to help myself or other women at all.

"A few years ago, whilst I was on my lunch break from work, I visited the nearby town centre to buy some lunch. I was on my mobile phone talking to my boyfriend. A much older man, probably in his forties, said something to me whilst we were stood together at the traffic lights waiting for them to go green. I apologised for not hearing what he had said and asked him to repeat it, he said “I like your sexy tights” and winked as he tried to grab the side of my breast. (I was wearing thick denier 80 winter tights with a knee length office skirt and big thick bomber jacket due to the cold.) I moved away just in time before he could touch me, and started to walk away form him very fast. He followed me and kept looking over at me, and so I ran into the nearest shop. This man stood outside the shop and kept looking at me. I felt very threatened and I asked the shop attendants to call the police which they did. The police arrived, and arrested the man. The whole incident was caught on the town centre CCTV cameras and I agreed to press charges of sexual assault. He took a guilty plea thanks to the CCTV footage which was irrefutable so I did not have to court to testify, which I would have been happy to do regardless. The man now has this sexual assualt charge on his criminal record for life. When I asked the police if the man had any other criminal record before this incident, they informed me that he did but were unable to tell me the exact details. I was 24 at the time. "

"I’m in the merchant navy (non military vessels- tankers, ferries), when I was training to be an officer on my second trip to sea lasting about three months sailing to West Africa I was keeping a lookout on the bridge, using binoculars and checking the radar when the officer of the watch decided to ask me ‘if I squirt when I cum’, questions about my sex life became frequent when on watch as the Filipino officers were of the opinion ‘you Europeans are immoral’ and also felt it necessary to comment on my appearance, lack of make up and weight and whether I was gay or not. I was the only girl onboard, the only British person and have never felt so alone in my life. Nobody would teach me anything, treating me either as a ‘little sister’ who was incapable, or not seeing the point ‘as you’ll be working in an office and getting pregnant anyway’. On arriving in a West African port I was put on gangway, 11 1/2 hours alone in an isolated part of the ship, with shoreside contractors coming and going constantly, I lost count of the number of times I was asked for sex/ marriage or it was indicated, it properly started to make me feel really scared and after three days of this I asked the officers (Filipino) if someone could sit with me as I was getting scared, was told to ‘shut up and stop complaining’. the worst part was trying to tell friends and family about this when I got home and being told ‘what did you expect? Well you work with guys’, or from a very liberal friend ‘that’s just their culture.’ I expected to learn to do my job not get asked about my sex life in an environment where I can’t escape for months on end and my cabin door is always unlocked in case of fire. Even now, one rank away from becoming a Captain, my Filipino officers keep asking me when I’ll be ‘settling down to work in the office to have children’ and I’m like ‘really? It’s the constant chipping away gets me down. It also has made me so wary of cultural expectations of women and scared to go ashore in the African continent or be myself around certain cultures, game face for survival, lying about being married or engaged. Nobody at home believes me when I tell them, so I don’t bother, or they think I’m being racist if I tell them about certain cultures who always ask for sex ‘because I don’t have a wedding ring’. It’s nothing to do with skin colour, it’s just what happens in certain ports in certain countries. That bugs me the most, people at home thinking I’m making it up. It’s like yeah mum, I love telling that story of being asked for sex or feeling terrified, it really brightens the conversation. Sorry is it not fitting in with your assumptions? Thank you for making it feel like I’m the problem, not the attitudes. Let’s discuss the weather instead. Of course it must be normal for male deck cadets to be asked their favourite sex positions when using a radar. I’m overthinking it. Best job in the world, if only people would stop asking for sex, about sex or expecting me to get pregnant, married to or not to them. You know if I could just get on with my job. "

"I work in a family-run campsite restaurant by the sea. The atmosphere is mostly relaxed, fun and neutral, with families enjoying their summer holidays together in a calm and respectful manner. But every so often we get a bad apple. There has been a group of families in the campsite for over a week. The women are kept, the men are lager louts, and the kids are rude and demanding. The men especially have been the worst. They choose to interact with me in a constant stream of sexual innuendo, often mentioning my appearance and sitting at the bar for hours on end staring at me and my collegues. They seem incapable of having a level, respestful conversation with any woman. Last night two of the men came to the bar, drunk, with their chidlren in tow. It was busy so there were lots of people around the bar, children, couples.. The men sat down and started talking to me about my hair, my eyes, trying to chat me up in front of my collegues and the other customers. It was so irrritating. Then, as my back was turned to do some till work, one of the men said to me (out of my earshot but audible to everyone else) “I’m going to f***k you.” My collegue told me about it 5 minutes later, just after they’d left, and I was so disgusted, so angry, so embarassed, that he could have said such a thing. I felt dirty. It was so degrading. The fact that he said it in front of his own children too makes it so much worse. And I felt threatened. What was this man actually capable of? I finish work every night in the early hours and I cycle home alone.. I was subject to verbal sexual abuse and bullying when I was a teenager and this has just made all the old feelings of shame and indignity come back. Verbal sexual abuse, or sexual remarks, should never be tolerated or brushed off as “banter”, never, never, never. This is the way we live in our society. How is that fair? "
I was in a big corporate in my mid twenties working on an IT project I had a meeting with an IT college in a small glass fronted room. We were seated side by side to view a document on a laptop when he out of nowhere put his hand on my thigh and moved it up very high. No one could see due to where he’d chosen to sit. I was trapped inside him in the corner of the room. I flinched away instantly finished the meeting more or less instantly and got out. It really destroyed my trust in men for years it damaged my confidence as I felt stupid and thought I should have seen it coming but it was out for the blue. To this day I always pick where I sit in room carefully so as to have an unobstructed exit.

P would often be the point of contact because while P didn’t like the way I was treated, P felt he had to play the ad litem’s Man Game. The case was settled in mediation, and on the way out the ad litem gave P a hand shake and when I stuck out my hand for a shake he moved in to hug me.

"In my university, there has been a modest program run by women graduate students for some years now to hold six meetings a year in a public forum to discuss women’s professional lives and prospects. The graduate student men met behind closed doors without the women in the group, and as they were given some charge over funding this year, they decided to change the mission of our professional group into a merely social group — think tea party guild circa 1954. Their reasoning: they didn’t feel included in a discussion of women in the workplace, and therefore the discussions were without value. I am working with the administration to reinstate our budget and to confront the shocking level of misogyny these younger men displayed in having a secret meeting to casually abolish our very modest program.

"A day symposium focusing on the future of the University, organised by enthusiastic graduate students, at which three of fourteen speakers were women. The female speakers were one PhD student, one temporary lecturer in her first post after her PhD, and one permanent lecturer in her first post after her PhD.

Each panel therefore had one junior female member with several more established male members, and the day ended with a panel of four men and one woman. The dynamics undermined the women, changed the focus of what was discussed (it was as if nobody ever had children or caring responsibilities to factor in), put a lot of colleagues off coming in the first place, and just felt uncomfortable.

Yesterday at work I experienced blatant and overt sexism from my boss. Whilst moving desks as part of an office reorganisation plan I requested to sit closer to a window and next to a colleague with whom I get along well. Responses to my request were always very evasive and unsatisfactory. When I requested my boss directly at the end of the day to move to the desk and was told the reason I could not move was because I was considered a ‘distraction’ to a male colleague who would sit across the aisle from me and if I was there he would be unable to work.

"I’m studying at university in a different city however moved home over the summer to work and save money. I was working at a local restaurant which was very bus one particular night. My section included some of the outside tables, of which one was two older couples probably about my parents age. I walked up to introduce myself as they sat down and the first thing one of the men said to me was “that apron makes you look frumpy, don’t they give you nice things to wear here”. So I was shocked and just laughed it off and said that I liked it, assuming that he was joking, but he kept on going on about it. For the rest of the night, the two men continued to drink round upon round of shitty beer, and every time I went over to their table the one guy made some other joke about it, kept on bringing it up. As if my job as a waitress was to be pretty and appealing to me. It made me feel so uncomfortable and wanted to change but didn’t for the sake of proving him right. I think of myself as a strong person with the ability to stand up for myself, but if I said what I wanted to say to him I would have gotten into trouble. So I just took it, and stopped laughing with him, I treated him coldly but he didn’t even seem to notice. It shocked me that his wife and friends weren’t saying anything, his wife didn’t even notice his rude and sexist comments. Maybe she was just used to it. When they came up to pay he took his eftpos card and looked me in the eyes and said ‘tell me when to put it in’, then aggressively jammed his card into the machine.

Every day at work the ladies on the desks behind me make comments about my clothes and my legs. I’ve asked them to stop but they think it’s just office banter. It makes me really uncomfortable. 
"I was on my lunch break not far from my work. While I was eating, someone from work approached me and we began speaking. What began as a normal conversation soon took a turn as halfway through he said, “you caught me looking,” referring to him staring at my breasts. He then began asking questions about them and told me I could show them to him, to which I could only reply, “oh”. I even commented that I wasn’t trying to draw attention to them and he agreed that I didn’t appear to be. He continued to pressure me to see them, offering to have me show them to him on his birthday, to which my brain could only come up with the response “oh.” He approached me three more times after I returned to work to remind me his birthday was coming up before I knew I had to go to the supervisor. I was scared, he worked with me and knew when I got off work, so when I was walking to my car I was practically shaking. Thank god the supervisor acted the way they did because they immediately moved him while the investigation was going on and changed my work hours so he wouldn’t know how to find me outside of work. For weeks I was so uncomfortable around any men at work, and I gave away the outfit I had been wearing to a friend because I just couldn’t wear it, but I talked to someone about what happened and now I tell others about what they can do if it happens to them.

"Late in July 2015, I attended a two-day workshop where our team of all-women managers was briefed by the all-men directors of the private sector company at which I work. At the conclusion of day one, everyone met up at the restaurant for dinner, sitting together and enjoying good food, great wine and light conversation. My colleague and I, both in our 40s, were seated directly across the table from 2 of the 4 male directors. The 2 of us had been chatting about participating in a martial arts class (her) and pilates (me), and were agreeing how staying active and getting fit contributed to a sense of well-being. One of the directors chose that moment to join the conversation, asking a couple of questions, before proceeding to describe a recent trip he’d made to watch tennis at Wimbledon, including the women’s and men’s singles finals. He then retrieved his smartphone in order to show to the director seated next to him and us the photographs he’d taken of Serena Williams, who had just won the title. His exact words were: “Look at her arse! She’s got the biggest arse ever. I have never seen an arse so massive!” For several minutes as they scrolled through the dozen or so photographs, and passed judgement not on Serena Williams’ sporting achievements and skills, but her body. They did this in front of a table of educated, hardworking women who they employ. I am disgusted with myself that I didn’t say something clever or jump up and quit on the spot. They behaved as they did because we had been “uppity women” who had forgotten our places, had forgotten that in their world it is men, not women, who get to decide what makes us happy, well, successful. And they had adopted a strategy of belittling a successful, powerful, skillful woman of colour to remind all of us of our places. Nearly one year on, this incident enrages and shames me still. "
"In my second job I knew I was underpaid, but thought this was a problem across the department as everyone said they were underpaid. A month after I left, I found out I was being paid two thirds of what the only other staff member (male) on the same level was, and less than the junior male staff I was training. I never took action as I had already left, but I still wish I had. This was in this century, for a major public company. "
"Recently in a meeting at work I was the only female in a room of 10 male colleagues. During the meeting one of them swore, then looked directly at me to apologise for his bad language. Why would I be more offended than anyone else? "
"My boss has a habit of regularly telling me to “breathe”. I am self-possessed and don’t stress out easily, and this is a typical example of something he would not say to any of my male colleagues. It smacks of “shut up, you’re hysterical”. "
"One of my friends at work is transitioning to be a man. Everyone’s been really supportive of what has been a difficult decision for C – ie telling us and our line manager – but she’s such a laugh and so lovely with it that to us she or he is still the same person. What has changed though are her jokes. They’ve become more sexual. We’ve noticed it and wonder if she feels this is how she thinks she needs to behave. The fellas have noticed it too and they’re just as bewildered as the women. The reason I’m writing is because on Friday she slapped my bum and said nice. I don’t know if she was joking or what as it’s something she’s never done before. But I was so embarrassed that I just laughed it off but everyone saw it as we work in an open plan office. No-one’s mentioned it but it’s like an elephant hanging from the ceiling – we all know it’s there. C is a real mate but I can’t have anyone – male or female – slapping me especially since she really went for it .I still don’t know why she did it. It’s not as if we were larking about or even in the pub. We were at work. It’s so out of character and just ridiculous especially since none of the blokes would dare do that. So do I approach her as my lovely colleague and mention I was a bit taken aback, or do I treat her like a bloke raise it discreetly with HR (with no names mentioned) for their advice? "
"I worked at a firm that had a warehouse; the warehouse manager pasted his office with loads of page 3 pics. It was about 1/3 female to 2/3 male workplace, so even though he was asked to take them down, he didn’t see why, and when anyone (e.g. his female co-workers)objected they were told that they were ‘frigid killjoys’ and it was a ‘harmless bit of fun’. Until the day that a new (female) co-worker, who was Dutch and was a complete stranger to the whole ‘page 3’ thing, saw the page 3’s, saw the warehouse manager’s adored 14-year old daughter in her school photos also on his wall, and asked, in all innocence, “oh, is that your daughter with no clothes on?”. Those page 3’s were down so fast he scorched the wall, to be replaced by various fishing/football/sportscar pictures. Too perfect. "
"Sexism manifests itself daily in the organization I work for. Here are just a few examples… From the list of applicants who applied for a secretarial-type position within my office, there was one guy; he had neither the years experience required for the position, nor proof of the skills required, but he got shortlisted anyway ahead of some 50 other female applicants – thankfully, he didn’t get the position in the end. Following the interviews for the position, my supervisor (male)- who was thankfully not part of the selection process – asked me if a particular applicant (female) I had met with was cute. Upon appointment of the new assistant, my supervisor said he would’ve preferred someone younger and hotter – I am not paraphrasing here. I work for an international non-governmental organization that promotes gender equality in the workplace but its good intentions are unfortunately useless in the face of this kind of sexism. I told my supervisor his comments were inappropriate. I doubt he’ll speak his mind on these types of issues in front of me again, but there’s no doubt that the next time he’s sitting on an interview panel, he’ll be assessing the women from this sexist point of view. "
"A younger male in my department inappropriately comparing me to his mother in a derogatory manner, in a situation where no insult or other opinion on me was necessary. "
"This is the nth time that I am facing gender discrimination at the workplace- where my manager has not given me the opportunities that I deserve based on my skill set and performance and passed them over to other male colleagues with similar or lesser experience- Where as a technically qualified professional I have been assigned admin work and plum opportunities have been given to the preferred people- where I am perceived to be less competent than others based on my gender, race, skin colour-Where my ideas have not been heard and my voice silenced. This happens again and again and again. I change jobs, move countries and yet the situation just repeats itself. My current male manager has nearly destroyed my career by making me do admin type work and withholding opportunities even though I am a technical specialist. I spoke to another female manager in my company today as I really needed to reach out. She advised me to look for other jobs as such kind of gender discrimination is rampant in my company. She did not see any hope. I gave up today on my career- until I watched Ms Bates’ ted talk on YouTube. I have now decided to not give up without a fight and complain against my manager and maybe mobilize wider support at the workplace to deal with this issue. Thank you for inspiring us Laura. "
"I was a supply teacher at a large school, but our staffroom was very small and we had to share desks. One afternoon, I sat where the secretary (I’ll call her Annie) usually sat on mornings only. The manager of the department walked into the staffroom (this was the first time I saw him) and looked at me sat at Annie’s desk and asked, “Where’s Annie?” I replied, “She only works mornings [which he should have known].” He then says, with a smile, “Well, it’s nice to have someone better looking than her anyway.” "
"I work as a creative in advertising. One of my mentors was a very successful Creative Director. He inspired me to go to college to learn copywriting and art direction. I won a student award and got a job at a good agency but I still really wanted to work at his agency as it was one of the best. I asked if he’d look at my book and he said that there was no point as he ran his creative department like a football team and he would never hire a woman as they would just be a distraction. That was thirty years ago. It’s a bit better now. 14% of Creative Directors are women. But considering women are the most powerful consumers on the planet, making 85% of all purchasing decisions, its still not great, is it…. "
"My boss asked me to be involved in interviewing candidates for a job opening in our team. Turns out what he meant was I, along with the two other women on the team would take them all for coffee after the interviews while the men would do the interviews. They will provide the intellectual rigour whilst we trolly dollies will find out if they are nice. "
"So i came back to work after 2 weeks off as I was getting married. I noticed, that after i got married I started getting left out of meetings, certain projects and wasn’t asked to go on long haul business trips any longer. I started to feel crazy and paranoid so I bit the bullet and went to the HR manager. SHE (yes SHE) told me that it was ‘to give me a break’ – I said, why? i haven’t been sick, I’m fine – why would i need a break? SHE said – well, the guys (directors) decided its probably best to leave you to it as we assume you’ll be having a baby as soon as possible, you know, it stands to reason. I saw RED – and asked why they came to that conclusion. ‘well, you’re 36… and if not now, when?’ I told them its none of their business when or if i CHOOSE to have children. I was met with blank stares, nods and shrugs. I feel like ive been left behind. "
i have been violated many of times and i have talked to many ppl to getme help and it has helped and i have threepist to control me emotion. also i have not say no and been rape and it mad me sad and i needed help but it was okie bc i had family to hleop meh XD 
"2 days ago I was out for the evening with some work colleagues, everyone was pretty drunk apart from my friend and I who were not drinking. I was stood at the head of the table trying to organise where we were going dancing. Without me saying anything or doing anything the guy to my left (a chef from my work) reaches out and grabs my boob. I was so shocked I slapped his hand away and moved to sit by my friend. Everyone round the table saw what happened but no one said anything. I felt like crying and so embaressed and angry. Later I was asked why I let him do that to me. "
"I answered my colleague’s phone at work once (we answer each other’s calls), and informed the caller that he wasn’t at his desk. At this point, the caller asked me if I was his assistant. Classic! "
"I was leaving a temp job I had worked in for about 4 months. It was my last day and many of the staff were having a take-away ordered in from a local restaurant, as a farewell. As people were finishing off their meals, one of the male managers decided he would tell a joke to the assembled folk. “How is a woman like a fried chicken? You start off with the leg, finish with the breast and end up with a greasy box to put your bone into.” Silence. Then one of the female managers spoke up “That is disgusting”. "
"A male colleague at work would constantly embark upon a barrage of ‘sexy’ talk during breaks, in a group situation. Whilst not directed specifically at me, it still made me feel very uncomfortable. Things like speaking about locations of brothels in the local area, talking explicitly about how he got the bra off his first girlfriend in the back of a car, attending a party in his youth where one woman allegedly had sex with 10 men in one night, etc. I was mortified to bring this up with my (female) manager, not wanting to appear over-sensitive and even thinking that I was imagining things. However, after she had a word with him, the inappropriate remarks were vastly reduced. I had no more trouble from the guy apart from him grumbling on one occasion that “some people can’t take a joke”. He now goes out of his way to be nice to me, although he does occasionally drop the odd clanger of a comment. Just shows how powerful women can be, when we work together to make things better for each other and to call people out on their bad behaviour. "
"I was working in a professional career, as a recent graduate from a prestigious university in my mid-20s. My job involved meeting the general public. My boss at the time informed me that “I would give them something to look at”. "
"I’ve encountered workplaces where the threat of rape makes me leave for a much lower paying position that is safer. I’ve had dates or acquaintances forcibly fondle me, pressure me into sex, and get rough because “it is funner when you act like you don’t want it.” All of this doesn’t compare to the minimalization that occurs every day. The hits and violation hurt but the dismissal goes deeper and sears my soul. On the rare occasions when I feel I can express myself, my life or its concerns, in particular if they involve sexual harassment or assault, are dismissed with a “that’s unfortunate.” It is almost like upon discovering that I’m a victim (read weak) that they need to distance themselves for fear they’ll catch my victimhood. I’m trying so hard to act like a normal person, to live the normal life I’ve always longed for. I so badly want to feel like someone cares what happens to me. I guess you could say it is self-hate, but there are times when I feel like once you experience things like this your value to others exponentially decreases – either smile or be forgotten. The worst thing that happened to me was when I was kid I told my mom that I knew a family acquaintance was going to rape me. His behavior had been escalating and I needed her help. I was scared and I wanted my mom to do what moms do – take care of their kids. Instead, I got a shrug of a shoulders. I cried, asking her, “Why?” She looked at me and told me I “deserved it.” She had been physically abusive in the past but it was stupefying to imagine that my mom, the one person who supposed to care about me, would knowingly let this happen. I had no other recourse then to run out of the house sobbing. Sure enough, he came for me. After which, my mother and the other grown ups started ‘searching’ me which included examining my panties upon my arrival home, sometimes examining me with their fingers to see if I was “clean,” and lectures about how I was a whore, as if I wanted this. No one seemed to register that I wasn’t a whore but he was not nor was he a perv. The other grown ups, even teachers, said they knew I had problems at home, but that I was “a survivor.” Sure, I dragged my way out of that cesspit to make it college but at what cost? Even now, people remark that I’m “tough,” which almost feels like an insult for they forget that even steel breaks. Long story short, if you see or suspect that someone is in trouble, do something about it! Passive bystanding is a crime too. "
"I’m an engineering researcher based at a university and in my nine years in the mechanical engineering dept of this institution I can honestly say that I have never experienced anything other than the equal respect accorded to all other students and staff within the department, regardless of gender, race, age etc. However, introduce myself as an engineer to (generally older) men outside of my workplace and I will reliably get a glance up and down and comments along the lines of “engineers didn’t look like that in my day”, “bet your professors love you” or “wow, maybe I’d have done engineering if I’d known that my fellow students would be good looking girls”. These introductions usually precede a meeting that we all then have to sit through as ‘equal and professional’ adults. It’s such a predictable response that it quickly became inoffensive to some extent, certainly boring and such that if I don’t receive a comment of this kind, I’m genuinely surprised. It’s never been intimidating sexism for me by any means, it’s just the relentlessness of it that’s depressing. "
"I’m horrified by many of the stories I have read here, especially the blatant sexual assaults that some writers have had to deal with on the street and in their workplace. I am thankful, I have never had to deal with anyone pinching my bum or touching me inappropriately. Unfortunately, degrading words, nuances and ideologies are still pervasive where I live. I am a physician but on a daily basis, I am called “nurse” despite introducing myself as doctor, called “honey” by my patients, asked when “the real doctor” is coming. I think this will change; more than 50% of our medical schools in Canada are attended by females. I just can’t believe that in this day and age, people still cannot comprehend my professional opinion because I am a woman. "
"I work for the British civil service where men regularly interrupt or talk over women when they are speaking, comment on appearance in the office such as grey hair showing or not enough make-up on, complement a women’s appearance when she is speaking about work, jeer at women who they perceive as overweight, complain about the number of ‘many ambitious women around these days’, call assertive women ‘aggressive bitches’, ignore women’s contributions in meetings only to acknowledge the same suggestions when offered by male colleagues, shake hands with men but ignore any women present, not make eye contact with women in meetings. Most managers and directors here are men. "
"Discussing Game of Thrones at work, one of my male colleagues was heard to remark about how Emilia Clarke MUST be using botox to look as young as she does. She’s twenty-fucking-nine! This same colleague isn’t great at remembering names. Therefore, he refers to female characters on GoT (and presumably every other show) as “*insert descriptive adjective here* bitch”. For example, he calls Ygritte, Daenerys, Melisandre and Sansa “ginger wildling bitch”, “silver haired/dragon bitch”, “red witch bitch” and “ginger Stark bitch” respectively. He refers to Cersei Lannister as “evil queen bitch”. Brienne is “man bitch”, in his mind. It is true, these women are fictional and therefore unaffected by his misogyny. However it is also true that this is telling about his attitude towards women in general, be they fictional or not. And he clearly sees us as nothing more than “bitches”. It’s fucking disgusting. "
"In literally every job interview I’ve been to in my entire life, I’ve been asked about whether I have children and if I’m planning to have any. I thought this was something they asked everyone, since where I live men go on maternity leave too and take days off to care for sick kids. I didn’t realize that only women got this question until fairly recently, when this subject came up in a group of mixed genders and the guys said they had never been asked anything like this in job interviews. "
"In my previous job – and this is one of the main reasons why I left it – the office “banter” was, on a daily basis, about the chest sizes of the women in the office, or the way that we /female clients looked. When I said anything to point out how sexist (and plain rude) this was, I was told (by both men and women) that I needed to “lighten up”, that I must be uptight, and that they felt sorry for my partner because I must surely give him such a hard time if I behaved like this at work, etc. Nobody else spoke out; some remained silent, thus enabling the “banter” to continue. Most found it acceptable enough to join in. I spoke to my manager and HR about this; I explained that it was incredible that this should have become the norm in the office. I had certainly come across everyday sexism before, but nothing so overt. Nothing was done. It had become almost an expectation for me to have to challenge this behaviour during my working day; so much so, that I felt surprised when I moved jobs and it didn’t happen at my new workplace. "
"The day before yesterday I found out that someone I had admired for a long time has died. When I went to work yesterday, the manager told me to smile because I looked gloomy. Never mind that I had a reason. And even if I didn’t have a reason to look gloomy, what I do with my face is still up to me. "
The head of my agency when completing a presentation to a group of employees referred to a woman he met the week before as a “double whammy: attractive and smart.” 
"I am the proud mother to a 14 month old. Living in the UK my husband and I took advantage of being able to share our parental leave, I took the first 6 months and he took the second. This worked very well for us, and also helped the fact that I earn considerably more. When it was time for my husband to go back to work he asked for flexible working in order to accommodate childcare. Amazingly, in the meeting he had with management to discuss this, it was straight out asked why he was the one wanting flexible working when I, as the mother, should be the one wanting to do this. This was sexist not only towards me as a woman, but also towards him. They could not understand why he might want to spend more time with his child! He handed in his notice a few days later and is now happily a stay-at-home Dad. "
"My boss asked if I could get him a cup of coffee, like if I was a man he wouldn’t have asked he would’ve just gotten it himself but because i am a woman he asked me to go get it for him "

"I am a university Senior Lecturer in a scientific subject, and I am female. I have just interviewed a PhD student applicant, via Skype, together with two male colleagues. The applicant was male, and speaking to us from his native country, Nigeria. As part of the interview, I asked the applicant a number of subject-specific questions, which he struggled to answer convincingly. He summed up that part of the interview with a quip to my male colleagues: “I can see the lady is enthusiastic.” "

"The everyday sexism I’ve witnessed at work in the last month or so from other WOMEN. “I was following a customer with beautiful long hair and wearing smart clothes but when she turned round she had the face of an old hag” Went on to explain how it startled her. ” I tend to ask the girls to do the tidying up as it seems to annoy the boys and the girls do it better anyway” From a manager, who lets the male members of staff stand around chatting while the female members of staff get a greater work load. “Oh that’s ‘boy looking’ for you” said by a manager who the previous week berated a young woman off for not being able to find an item in the stockroom on shop floor and in front of other collogues. “She thinks she’s young and cool but she’s not” said by a twenty something about a 32 year old. “Why don’t you wear more feminine clothes” said to a woman wearing long trousers, flat shoes and a shirt buttoned up to the neck. “I wouldn’t bother if I was you, the company never promotes women over 40” The woman concerned left, her skill set now lost. “I don’t feel like a proper woman unless my nails are done” As if fancy long nails maketh the human. “She’s unless and done it all wrong” Again by a manager about a female co worker who just completed in two hours a task that her male team leader couldn’t do in a week and “done it wrong” was a minor error on just one of trolley load of items she sorted out. The list goes on…… "
"I posted a long feminist rant on fb after a week of being objectified on public transport, demeaned at work and having to save a teenage girl from a gang of drunk men who were ‘just having a laugh’ at a train station in the middle of the night. A friend of mine jokingly commented on my post ‘Don’t you have any ironing to do?’ I wanted to comment back ‘I’ve done my ironing, I’ve done the cooking for the week, I’ve cleaned the house, the house which I bought myself, with the money from the impressive job I have. I’ve walked my dog, I’ve done the gardening, I’ve put on my make-up, I’ve hung some shelves. I occupy the traditionally masculine and feminine spaces. It’s not funny that I should do ironing, I’m not ashamed that I know how to take care of myself and others. I’m not confined by it either. I’m a person, a human being, I’m incredibly capable, I’m strong and together and inspiring. And it has nothing to do with my gender or your idea of gender roles. Whether you are making a joke or not.’ But I didn’t say any of that, because I knew he’d just come back with another ‘funny’ comment about my brand of feminism. I feel like I failed myself. "

"Our analyst relations team had invited an external agency to come and share some insights with us. The event was an hour long, and around 40 of us sat in an auditorium, listening as the visiting firm explored some ideas that may be of relevance to our own organisation. The audience invited was a mix of senior grades and directors. Both male and female were represented, although there were probably no more than ten females. The presenter was giving an example about the false perception that men make more decisions about car buying than women do. He explained that the latest statistics show that women use their cars more frequently and do a lot more mileage than their male partners. He then added “Who knew a person could clock up so many miles just on school runs and trips to Sainsburys, eh?”. I didn’t see any of the female attendees chuckling… "
Today i told a co worker that my neighbour kicked my mirror on my car and smashed it. He told me to just send over my bf to beat him up for me. I am perfectly capable at taking care of my own problems. Also i generally win in a fighting scenario witb my bf anyways. This is highly offesive to me since i find the number one thing women are looked down upon still is physical abilities and the capacity to kick some ass themselves. I am tired of being underestimated and looked down upon. We should not be limited by our gender and by having less expectations gor women to achieve athletic ability this limits us greatly. Not only do i have to fight the pain of working through the burn of pushing myself to that next level. I also constantly have to work through my self doubts that continually say i cant when i know i can. Doughts that have been slowly burned into me from a young age. That i am less capable because im a girl. Frankly that just isnt true. Only i get to decide how far i will go. 
"I attended a work training day last year and was given a booklet to fill out throughout the session, written by my manager. As a hospitality group, we eventually got to the customer service standards section of the booklet. As I turned the page, I was shocked to see, in bold capital letters: ‘Tits and Teeth’. That was it. That was their two-step customer service guide. Awful. "
"I am the executive producer for a major beauty brand, and listed on our company’s site as one of the key members of the executive team. This morning, as a courtesy, I met with a freelance commercial director. One of his first comments to me was “I am really interested in working with this company, so if there is someone higher up I should speak with, you should let me know”. What? I am quite sure he would not have uttered those words if one of my male colleagues had taken the meeting. Not a story of blatant sexism, but it smacks of the normalized sexism that women experience in the workplace. That we’re not taken as seriously as the men no matter our experience or title. "

"Just had an interesting conversation with my builder. Nice guy. He’s doing some pointing of a wall for me, and he finds it easier to hold the mortar in his hand – we got talking about how rubber gloves might be a good idea, and I said I can tackle pretty much any job so long as I have gloves on, and even feel stronger and more capable with them on. He agreed, and wears work gloves most of the time for pretty much the same reasons. I then told him that it’s very hard to find work gloves in smaller sizes – in fact it’s very hard to find any PPE in women’s sizes. He’d genuinely never realised this was a problem. He was totally shocked that I wouldn’t be able to just wander in to my local hardware store and buy rigger gloves or steel toe cap boots, or a yellow jacket etc etc in my size. Small steps everyone, small steps. "

I am a female and have been working in a school as a teacher for the last two years. I’m on part time hours and have not been given a contract either year. Last year I was told at the end of the school year I had hours the next year and then told in the summer I no longer had these (they were given to a male member of staff who started working there after me). I didn’t find out until 2 weeks into the school this year that I was being brought back. Today I went to management (all male) to see if I’m coming back next year and also to get managements opinion on me doing a course to qualify to teach another subject so that I would have more to offer the school. So when I told him that he asked me are you sure you’d be able for another subject Nd I said what do u mean of course I would. He replied well it’s 2 years and u actually have to pass d course at d end. I was lik fuck u I’m not stupid and I’ve never failed anything in my life. Then he went on to tell me that with my subjects at d moment I’m screwed and won’t get a mainstream job in the school and probably won’t get one in another school either cos there really bad subjects to have. Then he said I need to go away and think if i really want to teach and if it’s really the right career for me. And if it is I need to decide if I want to do mainstream or resource. Then he was lik if u choose mainstream there’s nothing for u here and if u choose resource there’s prob nothing for u here either cos Uve nothing to offer us. I would not have spent so long in college doing teaching if I did not want This as my career. Then he started telling me about what a cushy number I’ve had in this school d last two years and how lucky I’ve had it with behaviour and that’s when he informed me that the vice procipal said I have classroom management issues so I would probably need to do a course or something on that to try improve them. And that if I go to another school that I may not be able to deal with larger classes and behaviour problems. This is a blatant lie as I’ve never had an issue with classroom management and have been told in numerous other schools I’ve excellent classroom managment. Came out of his office thinking I’m d worst teacher in d world. So annoyed now cos I’ve basically wasted two years there. Nd I’m back to fucking square one now again with no job come September. 
"Please bear in mind when you read this that as a relatively wealthy middle-aged white male I don’t get the chance to claim I suffered prejudice very often. so my example may be a bit lame but i think it qualifies as everyday sexism. I was recently on a business trip to Bulgaria and was in the middle of reading Laura’s book Girl Up, so when the air steward on my flight offered me a magazine to read I declined. Sitting next to me was my colleague Marion who asked what it was I was reading – so I told her. She looked at me very confused. Now I don’t know if Marion would describe herself as a feminist – as some women seem to dislike that description – but I would say she is. Like me she started off as an engineer and now works in international banking so has survived in two male dominated environments and in my experience takes no shit from any man who dares to try and talk over her. I really admire her so was a bit disappointed that her reaction was “Why are you reading that?”. I explained who Laura was and about the Everyday Sexism project and how much I admired both. “That’s all very well” she said “but I still don’t see why you are reading it – did your wife tell you to?”. I just smiled and told her she had qualified herself for the ESP herself. I have now finished the book and think it is brilliant. Clearly I am not the target audience but I have two nieces aged 20 and 16 and would love them to read it – though a recommendation from their old uncle might not make it seem as cool as it is. They both suffer from anxiety about a lot of issues and seem to be having a tough time of growing up in today’s world and I think the common sense in Girl Up could help them a lot. Maybe I will get Marion a copy. "
"I was recently at a corporate networking event speaking with two men, one a senior partner at my firm and one a peer, when the conversation between them turned to their sporting interests. I was asked if I played anything, and I said I liked long distance running. ‘Ever done a marathon?’ I was asked. I proudly replied that yes I had. ‘What was your time?’ Just over 5 hours, I replied. Both men laughed and then went on to tell each other about their friends who were competing for various Iron Man challenges or who had recently run marathons in less than 3 hours. I immediately felt excluded from the conversation, which moved on to how the firm’s football team was doing in the local legal league. I soon felt that I had very little to contribute. It also left me wondering what they wanted to find in me when they asked these questions, which seem to be so common in the corporate field. Was I competitive? Was I skilled? Brave? Tough? Could I show physical and mental endurance? Was I confident and a team player? Was I interested in the same things as them? If they had asked those questions I could have told them that I was or could show all of those things. Things I had done in my life, other than play sport, were evidence to this. I could have told other stories, some so personal and one in particular completely tragic that to me, tell of my bravery, endurance and willpower. I also could have told them more about the marathon, which was on a freakishly hot April day when the heat and a broken iPod messed up my rhythm, but I didn’t get the chance to. I still finished it. I still got past the wall. I know some won’t agree with me, but I find this type of conversation to be very subtly sexist, especially in a competitive work place where everything you do and say is assessed. I love watching sport and I cheer on my firm’s football team, but I don’t want to be judged by my lack of involvement in it. Sadly it hasn’t been the first time I’ve been shut out of a conversation by male employees talking about sport in this way, and it’s seriously frustrating. "
"2 days ago I was out for the evening with some work colleagues, everyone was pretty drunk apart from my friend and I who were not drinking. I was stood at the head of the table trying to organise where we were going dancing. Without me saying anything or doing anything the guy to my left (a chef from my work) reaches out and grabs my boob. I was so shocked I slapped his hand away and moved to sit by my friend. Everyone round the table saw what happened but no one said anything. I felt like crying and so embaressed. Later I was asked why I let him do that to me. "

"I had recently gotten a haircut, thought nothing of it and went to work like any other day. Throughout the day I had gotten polite compliments from coworkers. Then an older male coworker started overly complimenting my haircut until I felt uncomfortable. At one point he asked if my haircut had my boyfriend’s seal of approval. I made the mistake of telling him I didn’t have a boyfriend but I quickly added something like, “My family approves and that’s enough.” Unfortunately, he continues, “You don’t? Well I’ll be your boyfriend and say it passes.” Another instance, I was working on a poster for him and he said, “Put some mascara on that font. You’re a girl you know what I mean, right?” Yet another one, I was making polite conversation and mentioned I was excited to dress up for the Christmas party. He asked if I was going to wear a dress and I said yes. He then responded, “Oh, then I’ll finally get to see your legs!” He continued by asking me to save him a dance. I took a guy friend to the party with instructions to cut in if this coworker asked me to dance. This coworker is married with kids and grand kids…. If I had to see him everyday I would have quit by now. "
"I used to work as a cashier at a store where you were literally judged by how friendly and genuinely nice you are to a customer. (like seriously, I was talked to by my manager a couple times for not being “genuine” enough) but anyway, one day some rude ass middle age man came through my lane to check-out and as he was paying, he turns to me and says: “You know you wouldn’t have this job if you weren’t pretty” and proceeded to walk away. I was so pissed off, but being a shy person as it is, I didn’t say anything for fear of getting in trouble if I started any shit with a customer. "

"Christopher said: I am always the person who is asked to do the moving, or help with moving, despite the fact that none of this falls within the remit of my job description or duties. And: …being singled out everytime due to being male, and stronger than the females in the office is sexist. There are trolleys in the store room which would allow the women to move large amounts of boxes without me. I know the example you gave is annoying and frustrating. But: Please understand that these are both examples of sexism *against women*. Because, it overwhelmingly has more consequences for women than for you as a man. Because, this assumption of women’s frailty is used to deny them countless jobs, and most likely stop the women in that workplace from getting on with lifting by themselves when they want to uninterrupted and not have a big deal made out of it. It’s very frustrating to hear “oh but sexism works both ways!” when it is already hard enough to try to tackle sexism that if you delve deep enough (not very deep) is always rooted in discrimination against women. And unless you have pitted yourself in some physical task against every single woman you have met or worked with there, it is also sexist of you to assume you are physicslly stronger than all of them just because you are a man, and I found it pretty offensive for you to have assumed that all of them would need a trolley, for example, to complete the job. I’m afraid all you’ve given is an example of sexism against women. "
"A man old enough to be my grandad sat next to me on the bus one very hot summer’s afternoon and turned his head sideways to stare intensely at me the entire 45 minute journey, leaving me trapped in the window seat as I couldn’t get past him into the aisle to move. He asked where I was going, where I lived, where I’d been that day, and was telling me that he liked my outfit, my face, my legs (I had shorts on as it was over 30C outside). I ignored him, pretending I couldn’t hear over my iPod and staring out of the window to avoid eye contact, although I could see his reflection so I knew he was still staring. I texted a male friend asking him to meet me at the bus stop in case I was followed. Sure enough, I was followed off the bus by the creepy guy. My friend was waiting for me and we stopped off at my workplace (a shop next to the bus stop, so the guy probably just assumed that I was a customer doing my shopping and thankfully left me alone). I hid in the stockroom before finally daring to risk the 10 minute walk home, with my friend accompanying me in case the guy was still hanging around town. I later found out that, after he gave up following me, the guy caught up with the girl who’d been sitting in front of me on the bus. He followed her to work (she was going straight to a shift at the local pub), and then proceeded to repeatedly turn up at that pub over the coming days looking for her until he was barred. I found this out from the girl herself as we were students from the same college. If I had continued to make my way home alone, walking through the local park as planned, I may have been raped. I was absolutely terrified. "
"The thing that startles me most on this site is the number of women who have experienced sexism and did nothing about it. Although it may be difficult to speak out in certain situations, this is the reason why it is so acceptable. I worked in a predominantly male profession for years and experienced sexism disguised as ‘banter’ on a daily basis. I could handle this fine as I was quick to retaliate with some of my own comments. However, when I went into an area of my work where there was normally only one or two people working, I discovered that they had plastered the walls with pictures of naked women. I told them that I was seriously offended and to take them down. I also said that, if they didn’t, I would come in and put up a naked picture of a man to which I was told ‘no ur fucking not’. So I went in every day telling them to take them down and told them I was offended. Eventually, my male boss went in and told them to take them down as it wasn’t appropriate for the workplace. I think he had heard me complaining and was worried I would complain to management. The pictures were promptly removed. Notice only after a man told them to (granted, he was a boss). Although it took some time,my complaints were taken seriously by my manager. I feel that women have to work twice as hard to get the same things that a man gets easily. However, if you’re offended then tell the person right away otherwise this battle will never end. "
"I am a man and I enjoy making my own lunch to eat at work. Whenever I do, all my male colleagues will say comments such as ‘oooh that looks nice- did your mum make it?’ or ‘what has your mum made you for lunch today?’ There is often disbelief when I explain to them that I in fact made it myself. Do they think that a) as a man I am incapable to make my own lunch/ cook for myself b) it is my mums duty to cook for me? "
"I’ve worked in different types of bars for the last 3 years. It still shocks me that a lot of customers (both men and women) refuse to order a drink from female staff, preferring to wait until a male staff member becomes available. Also, in the last bar I worked in, the manager was very demeaning and sexist but the worst of it was when he advised me not to wear a skirt anymore as I might attract unwanted attention and comments and may encourage male customers to grab me when walking past. I thought if it was anyone’s responsibility to ensure that behaviours like this didn’t happen it was theirs or even one of the security staff, but apparently it was mine. "
"At work the other day I pointedly asked a senior member of staff what he was looking at when he seemed unable to make eye contact with me during a conversation. He unashamedly replied ‘your boobs’, and proceeded to go on to inform me that if I was going to ‘parade round the workplace in a see-through shirt’, I should expect to ‘distract the men’. The next day when I wore a vest under my blouse in an attempt to hide my plain white bra he commented that it was a shame that I’d covered up. I reported both of these incidents to my (male) line manager and he responded that ‘men will be men’ and that I should simply take it as banter. "
"In addition to the current American obsession with the uterus, and forcing us out of the work place by forcing us to either report our medical need for birth control, or make us guilt-ridden, day care or nanny financially strapped working mothers. Women in the professional fields are dropping farther and farther behind. I’ve been groped a bajillion times on public transportation – but I worked in banking (the only woman VP in my group) – so walking into work from one kind of sexual assault, only to have to #1. Keep it to myself, #2 (and I always thought this was worse) Work with men who could never tell you the color of my eyes. So, I’m large busted. But. I’m also big brained. As I aged, the opportunities that were available because of my boobs and being cute and genial, those opportunities for advancement dried up. I was a successful sales person in a male dominated industry, until I turned 45. I’d had enough. I quit my job, where I really made 70% of the men. Hey – seriously, at first I was cheesed off. If there was any kind of event, I was assumed to be the planner. When there was a fund raising event, it was assumed that I would be the fund raiser. “Gals” are naturally “better” at that type of thing. You should do it to raise your profile….Walking to a meeting, they purposely walk fast. I’m 5’0? and I could never keep up. Any where I had to accompany my boss, I was forced to (literally) run to keep up. I would arrive 5 steps behind him, breathing heavily, sweating a little, and red in the face. My darling husband is a Psychologist with a focus on the work place. He sorted me out. I had 2 choices. Gut it out for the relatively good income, or bail. I bailed. He was delighted. He had hoped that I would, for my own sense of value. Opting out to begin studying for my dream career. We both thought we’d be more emotionally healthy and that our long, deeply bonded marriage would benefit. Well… Now, I’m experiencing another, more insidious kind of sexism. I’m being turned down for positions in my new field by Women. Younger, more attractive women, with less education and experience than I. They have been victimized, and subtly have learned what every young, pretty, SMART woman knows. You get hired and promoted if your’e the cutest kitten in the box. So make your moves while your’e young. 70% of $100K is better than 70% of $50K. Two lessons learned Following Your Bliss, changing careers in mid-life is a crime that Oprah Winfrey perpetrated on American women. Second lesson learned is that men and women alike collude in Work Place Sexism, only women don’t know it; or worse, don’t own it. Men are fairly open about what they do. They speak to your breasts, you hear them saying things like – Damn, you look hot (for 48), or as you walk away, She’s still got a nice ass. Since they think that’s complimentary, they don’t see the harm. But the backwards harm they do is like throwing a rock in a pond. It washes up on the other women in the workplace. Stay away from her; undermine her; she’s taking my place at the Sexism Trough. I went to a small (tiny) women’s college. We supported each other, we cared for each other. We still care and support and fume for each other. We thought – falsely – that in the mid-80’s as young women grads, that we were all past this. We look at each other now, and realize that we have fallen 100 steps backwards. If we’ve fallen backwards, men might say it’s our own fault. They might have a point? I can only imagine with a HUGE SHUDDER, what minority women go through. "

"â€œHey tuck down your shirtâ€? I hear a male coworker point out to be honest a little skin was showing, nothing embarrassing, so I just tucked it down I kept on working. â€œHey, Iâ€™m just trying to protect youâ€? he said a little more loudly, I just forced a weak smile his way and kept on working. â€˜Protect youâ€™ those words echoed in the back of my head, protect me? Protect me from what? You? This? Me? Society? Did I need protection? It was just a small strip of skin about half an inch, not even my underwear was showing, was it that distracting? Was I in such danger? In our office most of the employees are female, about 60%Â , even our COO is female, so why did I need so much protection and why did I feel such shame and discomfort from that comment. Maybe he didnâ€™t mean to make me uncomfortable but why would I need protection for such a small strip of skin showing, this happened a while back and it still lingers on the back of my mind. "

Instead he took every opportunity to tell me that I was “eating too many hamburgers” and was gaining too much weight because “You’re wearing all that baby weight on your ass.” I informed my chain of command, and nothing was done because according to them, my supervisor was “just expressing concern that his subordinate was going to have a hard time returning to PT standards after pregnancy.” Yeah, right, because that is the proper way concern for a subordinate is expressed- in demeaning comments about my body.

"This week I had a job interview since I’m graduating as a nurse practitioner soon. As I was talking to my boyfriend about it, he made a joke saying “wear a push-up bra.” I know he didn’t mean anything serious, and it was just a joke. But, I said, “why would you say that? That won’t get me a job as a medical provider.” Not being the first time we had an equality discussion, he told me I have to realize sex does sell, and then proceeded to tell me a story where he got a job over someone who was overweight and not well-dressed man, but had loads more experience than my guy. Basically the end of the discussion was that I wasn’t naive to how society often works, but I refuse to accept that that’s how it should work, and I definitely won’t play into it. I’ll get a job because of what I can bring to the table, and what I can bring definitely doesn’t include my sex appeal. My boyfriend’s view on feminism is a work in progress, but I try to do my part to educate him. He used to think feminism was this radical idea, but I’m seeing the changes that he’s realizing it’s just treating each other as equal people. "
"My teacher in my school when I was 16. Gave me a summerjob in his shop he owned and worked in while not teaching. I thought it was because I was a good student with talent. And ended up working all the while that man, my teacher, commented on my “young, tight body”, and other sexualized remarks, also claiming I should FEEL PROUD and HONORED that men commented my body. I didn’t dare to ask him to stop but I felt terrified and horribly stressed and anxious all.the.time. The worst was once, when he drove me home, and kept staring at my legs (I had shorts on, it was a hot day), and just and just stopped himself from leaning in towards me and I really shyed away visibly. Seemed like he was going to try to kiss me. Then he started talking about his marriage and how boring it was. After that car-ride the commenta faded a bit, and he got more mean, assigning difficult tasks and then mouthing on me for not being fast enough or effective enough. My motivation for work plummeted that summer. And I started having problems with sleep which meant that I sometimes was a bit late for work too, which I got to hear about of course. Luckily he did not return to teach at my school next year. But that has marked a lot of my future like a scar. I trusted him. And he did THAT. "

"Unfortunately opinionated female professionals are considered bossy and annoying. Leadership shouldn’t have a gender orientation. I meet so many men that are gentle characters (straight men) and have no interest in becoming leaders or they are just weak in mind and skills which is not a problem! Of course the most terrible case is when you meet men that are not good for leadership or even good professionals and are so ambitious that in the end they try with mean ways to fight especially their female peers using subjective arguments (women are sensitive etc). All in all, it is society that pushes all men to follow a career path while they would make greater fathers and husbands. Men should learn from women that they don’t need to succeed and make a fortune to be attractive! I think that is the problem. If women want to address the issue of continuity in their careers in case they make family then they need to retrain their loving mates to spend not just quality time with their families but take responsibilities with children and household. Women are not all the same so we need that complementary character in our lives that will support us. I have various experiences. For example my two very good female friends have entered with top scores into university. My two friends studied medicine and now 30 year old are doctors, got married and had children! So, we had this male friend who was a weak student but really wanted to study medicine. However he failed in the national anonymous exams twice in Greece. So he managed to go to Germany and study medicine. I met with him in our 20s and I was so happy to hear that he managed to enter a university because after all he is a friend. However guess what was his response when I told him that our common two female friends are studying medicine too. He said: ”Women should not study medicine. They will not become good doctors. They are too sensitive”. So don’t judge me if I say that an average man so weak in mind judges exceptional and bright women. Is this the kind of doctor that you want to trust? This is arrogant and ambitious average in skills and IQ male that was brought up thinking that he will become an exceptional professional because he is just male. "
"I’m a personal trainer and after twenty years in my profession, I finally opened my own private training studio. For some reason, men feel entitled to “own” the domain of strength. They claim the weight training areas of most gyms, often don’t clean up after themselves, and hurl their testosterone-fueled energy in a wide arc. I have had countless sexist experiences with male clients over the years. Some remarks from male clients include: “I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but my wife is uncomfortable about me training with you.” (You’re right – you shouldn’t tell me that) “You’re so demanding. You must be impossible to be married to.” (Your fragile ego is confusing coaching for criticism) “I’m not at all attracted to you, so I think this is going to work out well.” (I’m not here to be eye-candy for you) “In yoga class, this girl in front of me in downward dog had the tightest butt.” (Save those comments for your bros) And my favorite so far…. “You trained your husband yesterday? How did that go? Because when I train my wife, she’s kind of hostile.” (I actually train both of you and she seems to understand that I am a fitness professional and you are not. My husband also appreciates my expertise, which is why he isn’t threatened to learn things from me). In this guy’s head we were equals in terms of fitness knowledge. Never mind that he was completely out of shape. His arrogance, ignorance, and lack of respect for my years of study and hands-on-training upset me. I fired him the next day…but not before I made him puke first (the only time I have ever done that as a fitness professional). I screen my clients carefully to ensure a healthy, rewarding relationship. But men still come to my gym every week and push back against authority from a woman, and the worst offenders are the old guard. I make a distinction between “men” and “guys”. Real men are strong inside, support women, and share power. "
"As a father, I have struggled with protecting my children from sexism. When my daughter was a newborn (until the age of 2) I had trouble convincing my colleagues, friends, and family, that it did not matter what color her clothes was. She was a baby and did not care what she wore. But they all insisted she needed to wear “pretty dresses.” I work hard to find “dolls” for my daughter that did not promote the sexuality of the female body– and I have worked equally hard to convince my son that his super hero figures are “dolls” as well. But what I have found particularly troubling was that the people who seemed fine with allowing my baby daughter to wear “boy” clothes (or whatever it was) when she was a baby, were not OK when I wanted my baby son to wear those same clothes. This includes my wife. "

I am the only single parent in the company with no family support. Working defined hours has never impacted on the quality of my work or my ability to meet targets.

I turned to face him but stayed seated, and at some point in the conversation he held something out for me to take but when I reached for it he pulled it away and I automatically leaned forward to try and get it. I thought he was trying to be funny but then I saw that he very obviously raised his eyebrows as he looked down my shirt! He had purposely made me lean forward for this reason, and I was so shocked I didn’t even say anything at all. He just went off to his meeting or whatever he was there for that day. Subsequently he invited me several times to come have drinks with him and his wife and even told me I should move to his city, which I found very strange and uncomfortable, especially as he was making these suggestions on the workplace instant messaging system.

The audience didn’t really react, except one person who said: “But was she pretty?” he himself being the fattest, ugliest guy in the room. There was nervous laughter and the speeches continued. What can you do, what can you reply to a comment like that? Could someone have intervened, told him how sexist his comment was? I don’t think so. Because that’s just the world we live in. "

However, one night in particular saw two consecutive incidents that made me feel genuinely worthless. First of all (not that it matters) I was covered from head to toe in black clothing, the only skin visible was my head in which I had a pair of large dark headphones. To say I was not provocatively dressed is an understatement. At about 2am I began was walking towards my bus stop when a man walked towards me, grabbed me, lifted me off my feet and proceeded to bring me over to a group of his friends. He told me he loved me and that I was the most beautiful thing he had seen. Not only did I feel out of control I just felt generally powerless and unsafe. I did not find it as funny and jovial as he or his friends did and once he had put me down he tried to reason with me and shake my hand. As I reached forward with me hand he attempted to pull me in for a hug and subsequent kiss. About 10 minutes later as I stood waiting for the bus another man similarly about 15-10 years older came over to me and asked for a lighter. I responded politely that no I couldn’t help him, all the while leaving my headphones on. This man was evidently intoxicated and stood inches from my face. He showed no regard for my disinterest in talking to him and he stayed for a long time questioning me. He asked me from what part of the country I was from and acted surprised when I told him because he ‘didn’t think there were good looking girls’ from where I was from. During these two incidents not one person batted an eye or intercepted. I mean, what was I to expect as a female teenager walking the streets late at night on my own? I understand that a lot worse has happened to young women but I think that over years of feeling objectified and having these things happen completely out of my control scared me greatly. "

"I was told I wasnâ€™t bubbly enough with male clients of the hotel I was told I was a good looking girl and could do so much more with my looks, “You need to spend more time and put more effort into your looks, with a little bit of lipstick you’d look much better” “Its great to have another girl start as we’ve just had two of our ‘girls’ tell us they’re pregnant” "
Yes! Girls routinely outperform boys in school yet in the workplace this is not replicated due to everyday sexism.â€¨ 
I met the Guerilla Girls last year who were visiting London from America to research which institutions are sexist. They have been working at this for many years. They had Guerilla mask on when opened door as conceal their identities. We’re all contemporary artists trying to make a difference in terms of equality. I voted for WEP yesterday. It is Laura and Sandi Toksvig that have helped me talk about it more.

"Had some boys in a car throw an egg at me as I walked home from the station after dark. I have been wolf-whistled or hollered at by a passing van more times than I care to remember. I have been propositioned in the street several times. The last time, I said, ‘No, thanks. I’m married,’ to which he replied, ‘I don’t mind.’ I took my large 4×4 car to the garage the other day, and several make mechanics watched with glee as I reversed out, I assume because they didn’t think I could do it. Obviously, I can drive my own car very well. I have NEVER been to a nightclub and not had a guy brush up against my boobs or pinch my bum. I used to be seized into random hugs from a male colleague 30 years older than me at work. Most older male colleagues called me ‘sweetheart’ at work, most in a fatherly way that was meant nicely, despite being inappropriate, but one- the hugger- was a bit creepy, and my boss eventually made a pass at me. The worst was not directed at me. A group of male colleagues were sat at a bank of desks, chatting. One, Tom, had recently transferred from another office, and another, John, was due to transfer to that office the following week. Tom told John that he should try his luck with one of the assistants at the other office, a girl called Lucy, because she would be ‘well up for it’. I was very shocked, and I commented that I was sure Lucy wouldn’t appreciate being advertised in such a manner by her colleagues. Tom’s response was, ‘Oh, no. I know Lucy, and she’s that type of girl.’ I didn’t know how to respond. "

"I have to keep explaining to guys that feminists are not Female Supremecists, that the pay gap is not a myth, that rape jokes affect people… that yes, in 2016, sexism is still a problem. Yesterday a guy in my office denied the pay gap “when you take into account all the factors”. I said I would find some evidence and he immediately admitted he probably wouldn’t believe it. Young hetero cis white guys in our country have it so good they just cannot wrap their head around descrimination existing in our society. And they are allowed to get away with it by the continued lack if teaching about it in schools. Instead they get their opinions of it from what the men in their lives “reckon”. Politicians say they care but won’t do the basic ground work to make a cohesive society. "
"The industry I work in is heavily populated by men. I understood when accepting the position as the office manager for a company that deals with gas engineering and maintenance that I would be in a very different environment to my past jobs (retail management, fairly mixed in gender). I even mentally prepared myself for having to hear much more “colourful” language on a daily basis. This did not bother me as I can swear like a sailor when the mood strikes and as long as it’s not aimed spitefully at anyone and it hurts no one then so be it. What I did not anticipate was blatant sexism in the form of “terms of endearment” as they have been called. I am, on a daily basis, referred to as “sweetheart”, “little lady”, “the office girl” and most recently “babe”. These titles bestowed so “graciously” upon me, not only by employees of the same company but also by employees of our suppliers, have me far beyond annoyed and insulted. But that’s the problem in a nut shell. When I explain that I am not comfortable with these terms I am met with confusion, condescension and even hostility. One engineer refused to speak with me at all after I mentioned my discomfort, instead deciding to act as though I don’t exist when we are in the same room and another has told me that “Political correctness has gone mad! There’s nothing wrong with someone calling you ‘babe’. It’s a compliment.” It has gotten to the point where I am now changing who I am, which absolutely disgusts me. I no longer wear make up, dresses or skirts (not that when I ever did they were shorter than half way up my shin or light foundation with a bit of mascara) to work and have found myself now ignoring these comments instead of making my discomfort known. I’m now hating who I am because the lack of support makes me feel weak, out numbered and worst of all; dramatic. I should mention, the person who made the statement about political correctness is my boss and head of the company. I have no intentions of making claims etc. I just want it to stop. I just want it to be a non issue. I just want to work in peace without being reminded every day of how they see me. But the more I protest, the more “irrational” and “difficult” I’m being. "
I was cautioned to watch my professional demeanor when a man 10 years my junior was seen flirting with me at an after work event. I had been sitting alone at a table because my feet hurt (heels for a solid 5 hours at that point) and he sat next to me and we had a conversation. Evidently my male superiors thought that important enough to bring up in my annual review.

"I have just been rejected from a job opportunity after a very successful first stage interview. The feedback I received was that I would not be able to handle certain strong characters in the office, possibly because of my age….given that there were no questions about how I previously have handled difficult individuals, a skill I actually pride myself in, and my CV has enough information to tell you that I’m nearly 30. It sounds very muchly so to me because I am a woman. My name on my CV is sexually ambiguous and perhaps Adam the interviewer was surprised to find out I was a woman when we spoke. The recruiter who organised the interview could not stop apologising to me when he gave me the feedback and said he has escalated it to his manager – not a normal response to a candidate being rejected. This is the first time this has happened to me but it has really effected me and I can’t stop thinking that this is what so many people think about women and this is probably just the first time i’ve known about it happening to me.

"I was sacked by a theatre company I’d worked with since it was established. I’d pored money into it, my parents poured money into it, I worked for them for free for years. My writing, I was told, was at the heart of the theatre we’d previously collaborated on. I was asked to write a play for them. We did two weeks of development, and everyone was excited about the new play, especially the scting company. I was half way through a (unseen) first draft when I was called to a meeting. The artistic director and the dramaturg, both men, sat opposite me and told me I was cold and difficult to work with because I didn’t always agree with them in the room. I was committed and passionate to create the best play we could – and tried to always focus on the work rather than niceties, how I’d always worked with professional companies. After I left the meeting, I received a phone call from the AD saying they didn’t want to work with me anymore, but they wanted to keep my ideas. They are now putting on a play that the dramaturg has taken over writing – the plot and characters are the same as mine. "

"I’m a twelve year old girl, I attended a grades seven to twelve school. Our school is homophobic and a little sexist, they believe in gender assigned roles. Anyways, like many schools we have the usual dress code. I don’t think that we should be wearing crop tops and over revealing shorts, after all school is a place of business. Except girls are only targeted, some boys will wear muscle shirts that you can see their nipples, but they don’t get into trouble. The dress code is teaching girls to be ashamed of our bodies. It teaches boys that girls are sluts. Why should I not show my legs? Everyone has them. I’m a woman, I have woman parts and I’m not ashamed of them. Yes, I wear a bra. Why is it bad if you see the straps, at least I’m wearing one. The schools tell us that we are distracting boys from learning, why don’t we teach them how to stop thinking that girls are only sex objects. The main people who are enforcing these rules are women, they say that it is following the Catholic faith by dressing modestly. How is embarrassing girls for having shoulders or wearing a bra being a good Catholic? Women should be able to have the choice of being covered head to toe or not wearing anything at all without being labeled. "
"I was really upset coming to work one morning recently. I looked like I had been crying because I had indeed been crying. In reality, I should have called in a day off, but I had half-heartedly convinced myself that I could keep it together enough to get through the day. One of my male co-workers saw my red face as I walked in and said, in THE most condescending, mocking tone, “Awww, did you have a fight with your boyfriend?”. This obviously flared my already frayed nerves and temper but I was in the middle of civilly replying “No, it’s not that” when the same co-worker immediately interrupted me after “No…” to say in a loud, almost excited (for some weird and unknown reason) voice, “You did! You did fight with your boyfriend!”. At that I broke down and cried my eyes out. Through my tears, I clarified that my distress was on account of my just having heard of the sudden and totally avoidable death of a friend of mine from my home town. He was just two months older that me (I’m in my late 20’s) when he OD’d from prescription medication. I’m friendly with all his siblings and we all used to hang out together a lot when I was in my late teens. I’m devastated for him, for his family, for myself and for all our mutual friends. The automatic assumption that my VERY upset demeanor must have been over something as trivial and mendable as an argument with my boyfriend is fucked up. Interrupting my explanation of why I’m so distraught because he, as a man, felt he must know better than I do, is fucked up. The tones my co-worker took, ranging from patronising and mocking to inexplicable excitement, when addressing me are fucked up. The fact that he never apologised for either his behaviour nor for my loss is fucked up. I honestly felt like I would have been treated with more respect and take seriously by him if I were a man. "
"I work in an electronics wearhouse. There are few other women in this workplace. One day, I was on my knees rearranging some shelving when an older male co-worker commented that he could see my thong. I simply said “Whoops!” And pulled my pants up before continuing my job, thinking nothing of it. However, when the next day he started asking what underwear I was wearing and why it wasn’t showing I called him out on it and told him he had no right to talk to me that way. He groped my ass in response. I immediately went to my HR rep, a woman, and she commented “Well what do youexpect, working around here?” And did nothing more to help me. I later found out that 9 other women have complained formally about being harassed by this man and the company has done nothing. Absolutely nothing. Apparently my story got told though, because while working with this disgusting person the next day, someone else called “Ooh Kate is that your new boyfriend?” I want to staple his penis to a pigeon. Then feed that pigeon to a shark. "
At work recently a woman has been increasingly passing remarks at me and making suggestive gestures in a sexual manner. I have spoken to senior managers who have simply laughed at my experience and told me there would be no chance of any action being taken. The women has touched me inappropriately and has told me ” Good luck with getting me sacked “. Colleagues do not seem to have any empathy for my situation and have suggested that if I didn’t reciprocate her approaches I was “probably gay”. This is a further example of sexism against men in the workplace. James 
"I was sexually harassed for years and eventually assaulted by a work colleague. When I brought this to the attention of senior management of a charitable social housing association in west London, nothing was done. When I formalised it in grievances, I was faced with aggression, antagonism, animosity, bullying, discrimination, victimisation and eventually dismissal from work (Talk about justice and fairness!). Now, my case is to be heard before the Employment Tribunal in June 2016 for what I believed was my legal right in the first place. My life turned out to be nothing else but a living nightmare I just can’t wake up from. Know this, you’re unlikely ever to receive justice from a corporation, all they’re after is a clean slate, undamaged reputation and will do pretty much anything to have you silenced. Do I have regrets for taking action? Not at all – I’ll go to the very end even if it was the last thing I had to do in this life. "
"When I first married my husband I became thrown into a family of ‘hard working self made men’ seriously that’s how they called themselves. My father in law was always so busy living upto his own standards that his wife ( mil) would always have to sort out all the work in the house. She would paint, hang wall paper and do diy, all paid for by her ‘little job’ she had. When we graduated ( both in same year with same degree) my husband went to work for his father, one job he needed a decorator to paint the walls of an office white, he was desperate and needed it doing adapt to complete the job. So he gave the job to me, I was competent and professional, turned up and started the job. Until lunch time when my father-in-law turned up , saw the work and was pleased, saw me and went nuts and sent me home! His reason ‘it’s unprofessional to have a woman on a building site, women don’t have the same skill set’ (keep in mind the back story of his wife at home) A little later into our marriage one of his most senior and experienced specialist colleagues , an engineer who was a world leader in his field turned up in the office as a woman. At the age of 60 he was bravely going through the transition. I am glad to say she was welcomed ( after much sniggering) I do believe however she’s still the only women in the company besides the receptionist! "
"Once when I was staying at my sister’s I was sleeping on a mattress on her living room floor. her boyfriend got up early in the morning to make tea and although I heard some movement in the kitchen, I was still asleep when he got in beside me and pressed himself against me. I was so shocked and still half asleep and wasn’t sure what to do. he lay there for a few minutes before he went back to my sister’s bed. When he had gone I realised how ridiculous it was that he would think that was an OK thing to do. I was worried that my sister wouldn’t believe me but I told her anyway. Thankfully she did believe me and confronted him. he maintained he was just being friendly. Friendly? Friendly is a handshake or a cup of tea not pressing your penis against me. My sister ended their relationship as a direct result of that incident. I agree that every woman can give countless examples of this. Another time, when my hair was short and I was ordering drinks at the bar,a man in his sixties stared straight at my breasts and said “oh so you are a girl, I thought you were a bloke” I was so shocked I said nothing but I felt really dirty as if I had done something wrong. when I was working in a shop at 17 an older man in his thirties pulled me into the kitchen and kissed me . He held me tight against the wall so I couldn’t pull away and then when he had enough he went off as if nothing even happened. I never even complained as it had happened before I could stop it and I didn’t know what to do. in another job, my boss made comments when I had a cold about how I must have caught it lying around in cars with boys, scantily dressed. he thought he was being funny. Even though I have been married some time, many of my husband’s friends have made inappropriate comments. one touched my hair and told me I was lovely while I was even with my husband, I refuse to even be in the same room as him anymore. Another told me if he wasn’t married, he would marry me like I wouldn’t have any say in that myself. Another thinks it is hilarious to embarrass women by asking them to sit on his lap. he puts this across as a joke but I am sure he would feel totally comfortable if the offer was taken up. I have countless more examples and I have just realised that these are flagging up to me since you made me aware how commonplace this is. .Some of the stories I have read on here are so shocking. It makes you terrified for young girls growing up as even very young children are targeted. Thank you for making this an important issue. "
Ive been sexually assaulted multiple times at work but the police do not believe me 
"I had my first experience of sexual harassment when I was 12 years old. A man followed me through the grocery store, muttering things under his breath. I told my mother. She didn’t believe me. A few months later, an older man pinched my butt in a crowded department store elevator. I turned around and yelled at him. He pretended he didn’t know what I was talking about. In my early 20s, my then (creepy) boss would run his hand up and down my back as he talked to me. Sometimes his hand would wander around to the side. He repeatedly ignored my instruction that he not touch me until, one day, I yelled really loudly for him to keep his f’in hands off me. The entire office heard me and several partners came running. Around that time, leaving my office one evening, two young men grabbed my breasts in front of the Museum of Modern Art in NYC and laughed as they walked away. And I remember these incidents vividly this many years later. Construction workers, men on the subway, men on the street, men on the train; you name it; I’ve been harassed by them all. In the past few years, I’ve noticed that the harassment has lessened and has now completely ceased. I’m 60 and so, happily, completely invisible to these men. The irony is, I’ve never been in better shape or felt more sexy in my entire life. "
"I was 16 and had a summer job at a cafe, and below the cafe was an estate agents. One man, about the age of my father, would always come up to get his coffee, and he was a very friendly man, smiling and jolly, bold, chubby and short. I was told to get some loo roll from the cafes storage room which was downstairs in the estate agents, and he happened to be down there. I was having trouble opening the door, so he came over to help, i went into the little storage room (which had no light) when the door suddenly slammed shut behind me, i tried opening the door but it didnt budge, so i just grabbed what i had to from the storage when i heard him say “why arent you screaming?” I didnt reply, just stood there waiting, which made him open the door and i stepped out He asked again “why werent you screaming? Usually when i do this to the other girls (meaning the girls that worked with me) they always scream.” I just said “well im not scared of the dark” and tried to walk away, but he managed to get his arm over my shoulder and his hand began to grope and massage my shoulder, he did that while giving me this weird, pervy smile, making me feel extremely uncomfortable and i blurted out “i have to go back to work” and ripped my shoulder out of his arm. School was starting soon, so I had to leave the cafe anyway, it was just convenient that it was after this uncomfortable experience. Its probably good to also mention that there was a muxture of both men and women working at the cafe, and that he only did this “prank” to women "
"I was 14 an sent to take part in some work experience at the police for a month. I was to be an asisstant to a DS who was going to show me the ropes of the job. First thing he does is to say to me ” no milk 2 sugars please.” After I bring it to him, he gave me a mountain of paperwork which “needed to be completed quickly”. I was new and took the “job” hoping to impress someone. half an hour later, he returned with another lot of paperwork. When I told him that this was a joke he benyt down to be on a level with the chair( very demeaning, felt like a naughty child) and said that “this was what your type did round here and that I should be good good at organinsing things anyway”. When i questioned him about his sentence he just called me a good girl and walked off. "
"It just floors me how many men think they have the divine right to dictate how women live and what we should or shouldn’t be “allowed” to do: “we don’t have to LET them drive/vote/whatever”, “women don’t BELONG in the workplace/the army/wherever” "
"When on my lunch break, I went to my Costa for my usual americano. I was second in the queue behind a man, who had already ordered and was waiting for his drink. Whilst the barista was making my drink, I spotted some flapjacks by the till point. I went to pick up one of the flapjacks to see how much it was, and the man standing in front of me said, ‘Ooo they’re fattening. They’ll ruin your figure.’ I was completely taken aback. The worst part about this was that he himself was overweight! He had a beer belly that was practically resting on the Costa counter. Had I not been working, I would have pointed this out to him. Instead, I asked him to not make such comments to me and I purchased the flapjack to prove a point. The reason this annoyed me so much is because even though we were strangers, he felt it was his right to point out what I, as a woman, should and should not be eating! (I just know that if I was a man he wouldn’t have made the comment!) In making the comment he had also clearly checked out my figure, and seen it as his responsibility to make sure I maintained it. Like it’s his business! I didn’t check out his beer belly and say, ‘you better have skimmed milk in that mate. Try the salad.’ He didn’t look too pleased when I corrected him either. I really wish I’d have told him I was eating out at Nando’s that evening! "
"It is disturbing that some older men who hardly know me call me “love” when asking a question, but would not call a man “love” when asking the same question. I have male relatives who never call me “love” but just call me by my first name or ask “Excuse me, what do you…” When I ask a question to a person, I either address that person by the first name or use “you” in the question. Such as: “Excuse me, do you know where I could find [insert thing]?” I never call people that I don’t know “love” or “babe” because it is patronising and irrelevant to the conversation. If people I do know extremely well request to be called a “pet name” or one we both mutually agree on, only then do I use the “pet name” at that person’s request. I have had many embarrassing, frightening and painful experiences after being called “love” or “babe” by men as they often used these terms of pseudo-endearment in a patronising way, put me in a dangerous situation or to tried to talk over me. I respect people who make the effort to call me by the term “you” or my first name. I always try and treat people equally like this in a way that doesn’t distract from the task of the question at hand. The people who I trust the most behave in this way. I don’t go round calling men who are strangers “babe” or “love” (they’d think I was creepy and strange if I did this!). So why do women get called these terms by men they don’t know and men do not? Why does this happen in professional settings when I’m wearing a name badge? I am really sad when some men and women try and place me into a box just because I am female. I have had female mental health workers call me “sweet” while ignoring my aptitude at activities such as video games or STEM activities. It is infuriating after all of the hard work that I have put in that some people want to put me in the “sweet passive girl” box ignoring what I can do and projecting their own fantasies of what women “should be like” onto me because they say I have a “female brain”. They don’t listen to me, talk over me and tell me that I am like what they think I should be like without listening to the evidence. They don’t listen to what I’m really interested in at all. I try and look at each person as an individual and I try to listen to people. I don’t call people pet names unless they ask me to and I am not working in a professional setting when I talk to them. I try to be as fair as possible and treat people the same. "
"I work in a university. We currently have workmen undertaking some painting who had put newspaper down to protect the carpet. Unfortunately, ‘page 3’ was face up.

My colleagues started to actually feel for me and enjoy giving the SAME answer to the customer. It will get better soon. Am sure. Keep this project going, please. Thanks! "

I was called a cum guzzler by a supervisor in an open office environment with my peers present. 
"My manager made some outrageously offensive comments about the clothing of a female professional in a meeting last week. This kind of thing has been going on for years, despite my organsiation being in a sector that means staff working there really should know better (shouldn’t they all??). For some reason last week when this happened I just snapped and called him out on it – in front of four other colleagues. Nobody backed me up, and my manager seemed livid about being challenged. He has arranged for us to meet tomorrow to discuss the ‘obvious frustrations’. He has no idea that his sexist comments are at the top of my list. I’m so cross that I have to spend most of today preparing for the meeting tomorrow, when he is the one in the wrong, and I am already so overwhelmed in my role. I’m using Laura Bates’ article in the Guardian in April to galvanise my thoughts, and it helps me to know I am not alone. Thank you Laura for providing this platform and for all the work you do. "
"This is a very minor thing, but really annoying, and not uncommon. I’ve had horrible, frightening things happen to me as a result of sexism but I don’t feel I can post about these. I am a woman in my late twenties and I live and work in a small university town. The other night I went to see an opera with a friend of mine. I hadn’t bought tickets myself because the opera was written by one of my least favourite opera composers. (My least favourite because I don’t think he was actually any good at music.) My friend had bought two tickets and offered one to me. Now, this friend is a single man in his late forties, and we met through a choir and are friends because of our love of music and shared time together. He is a scientist by day and so has many colleagues I don’t know. After the opera we bumped into one of them and his wife and we walked back to campus with them. This couple were in their sixties. They obviously thought I was just some girl that my friend was dating at the time and because I’m younger than him and had made a tiny effort to look nice assumed from the off that I knew nothing about opera or would have anything interesting to contribute about the evening. The proceeded to talk only to my friend and would not let me get a word in edgeways. In fact they were making pretty stupid and dull comments about the opera. As this kind of thing happens all the time and I was too tired to get annoyed I just started ignoring them and walking slightly apart from them. (My lovely friend was of course trying to include me but these two people were determined to show off all they knew about opera, which again wasn’t much.) In the end the older man separated himself and said to me condescendingly “so do you have any kind of preference for opera?” so I said “well you might take as your answer the fact that I am just finishing a PhD in the operas of Verdi”. He almost fell over and kept saying “I didn’t expect that!” over and over. I felt like saying “Why not? Do you need a penis to listen to opera?” or something similar but in fact this man is acquainted with many of my older male colleagues and I didn’t think it was a wise move. I think letting him stew in disbelief was strong enough though and maybe he won’t be so sexist next time. (He probably will.) I’m clearly old enough to have that kind of knowledge and experience and it is a small university town where you never know who knows what: it was based only on the fact that I am a woman who was accompanied by an older man. It also annoyed me that he assumed I was on a date with my friend: that I would have nothing to offer him in the way of good conversation or good company and that I was just some kind of arm candy. Urgh. I don’t make much effort to look nice but I think they’d all respect my intelligence more if I made a solid effort to look messy… but then they’d be annoyed I didn’t “make the effort”. It’s all so tiring. "
"At a recent company meeting, our CEO was asked about our dire record on gender/racial/etc. diversity, even by the standards of the industry. He, however, claimed that this wasn’t a problem, since he was blind to gender/race/etc. So that’s all right, then. "
"Yesterday, a sexist co-worker of mine who always openly complains that I do heavy lifting smacked my ass with a pole we use for reaching high shelves in front of all our co-workers and some passers-by. I glared at him while everyone else either laughed or ignored it. Moments later he imitated me calling his name in a dramatically sexual manner, as though I was moaning his name. I was humiliated but I’d make my own work life absolutely unbearable if I called him in it. Also, they all know I have a BF whom I love very much. It’s just as degrading to him that they think they can treat me like this. "
"When I was a shot girl I was forever subjected to horrible comments and behaviour from not only the customers but even the bouncers of the club who were supposed to be keeping me safe.One night three bouncers pinned me against a wall and were laughing whilst they all pushed up against me, they thought it was hysterical but I felt so degraded and helpless. Another night, whilst I was asking a man if he wanted a shot, he put his hand up my dress trying to finger me.. It was horrendous, the job overall was horrible I would feel constantly objectified but felt slightly better because of the good money I was making, it was a vicious circle. "
"I have always been very career oriented. I got married in my late 20s to a man about 10 years older than me. When we had our first baby, then second I always worked full time at a high-pressure job. I was overwhelmed with everything that goes along with having children. My requests & expectations for help and sharing parenting were seen as nagging. When business conferences came up that would help both our careers he always went. Housework? Me. Daily life stuff like kid running, play dates, activities, dressing them, feeding them? Me. Eventually I came to find out that he used business conferences to meet and sleep with women. He would take photos of them and show them off to other men he knew. We shared professional circles so all of that reflected back on me and indirectly at our children. Did anyone tell me? Warn me? Protect me? Stand up for me? Nope. They laughed along with him. Patted him on the back. He was proud of himself. I divorced him, moved, changed careers, endured serious professional and personal humiliation … and still he feels proud of himself. Travels to conferences. Advances his career. Has even much, much less child raising responsibilities – it’s all on me. But I’m ok with it – I’d rather have a rat like that and all his rat friends far away… But I realize that this all happened as a product of his feeling of entitlement & extraordinary sexism that our culture accepts as okay. Vile behavior like that is not okay – but try telling him that and he’d smirk, puff out his chest and ring up one of his lady friends to meet him for a fuck and he’d be just fine with himself. This world is mad sometimes. (Upside? I see and call out sexism all the time now, teach my children about what is ok and not, and have an honest, loving partner who proves that good men do exist. He thinks that ‘the ex’ is the worst representation of what a man can be and thinks he’s a pos.) "
"At a work meeting i was the only female present, a senior team member inappropriately used the “C” word during “banter” with another colleague. Another senior team member berated him saying “you shouldn’t use that language there is a lady present”. I was then subject to a repeated apology for use of the swear word. I felt embarrassed to be singled out, in addition to the fact that such swearing is clearly inappropriate in the workplace anyway. Maybe this is positive sexism, as it could be portrayed as polite to women, however it makes me feel as if I am not taken seriously in the workplace as I am somehow weak and easily offended by things such as this.. "
"I am not really entirely sure when I first encountered sexual harassment. And there are so many cat calls and hollers that I won’t be able to detail every one of them. However the biggest instances in my memory include the pervasive harassment I encountered at public school, and then all the unwelcome treatment I have encountered dating. Groping started in junior high. I remember being in an 8th grade science class and literally pushing the hands of two guys away for an hour straight as they just kept trying to run them up my legs under the desk. I don’t know if the teacher knew what was going on or not, but if he did he definitely didn’t stop it. At the time I felt like speaking up would be just causing a fuss over nothing. That was only the first time, I remember countless times after that sitting on buses or in cafeterias or at assemblies pushing guy’s hands away and just quietly dealing with the attack. In high school they began to get bold and starting to slap or grab my butt. I lowered the straps on my backpack so they couldn’t do it in the hallway, and limited how often I stood up in class. I was also very conscious about bending over and made sure to always crouch down so that it wouldn’t be as tempting for the guys. Then there were the sexual names and questions. I’m a redhead, so back in ninth grade one of the guys started asking me “does the carpet match the drapes?” I had no idea what he meant until he went on to explain he was asking if I also had red pubic hair. I didn’t respond but instead got very red and walked away. From then until the time I graduated many of the guys in my class would call me “fire crotch” I was identified by the color that they assumed my pubic hair was. Once I was at University I began to date, and encountered several instances where I was pressured into crossing my comfort line sexually. In a few instances there was a lot of force involved. Guys would just keep moving my hand out of their way until they finally got what they wanted and they would get more and more aggressive. Even if you never said yes, they would take your giving up as consent and continue on. Eventually I was raped by a boyfriend. We had previously discussed our lines and he knew that I did not want to have sex. I had told him no several times that night and pushed him away again and again, but he decided he didn’t want to be pushed away, so he held me down and took what he wanted. He then felt so bad that I took pity on him, forgave him, and continued to date him for another three months. Forgiving and looking past the constant harassment and assault had become so normal to me that I actually continued to date my rapist for three months after the fact. Needless to say, once I finally began to deal with that it took it’s toll on my mental health. I now am very wary of guys and walking alone across campus at night causes pretty extreme panic especially if a guy is anywhere near me. I wish my story was a rare one, unfortunately I know several other girls at my university with similar experiences and that is the saddest part of all. "
"Doing school work experience at a recording studio about the age of 13. I was helping a male roadie move a bass amp to another venue in the local area, he was asking me about why I choose the studio etc. He asked what kind of job I wanted one day. I said ‘I’m not sure something in the Music Industry.He then replies. ‘So you want to me a groupie”. I was so shocked I didn’t even know what to say. Would he have said that If I was a man . Definitely not. "
"I’m a college professor and I look younger than my age. The other day I was outside the classroom waiting for the previous professor (an older male) to pack up so I could go in and teach my class. Some of my students were already sitting there. He motioned to say it was ok to come in and looked surprised when I placed my things on the table in front of the classroom. He looked me up and down, and then said, “Wow, I thought you were a student. You look too vibrant to be a professor”. I was too stunned to respond. And this sort of comment happens in academia ALL the time. "

"With a colleague, I write a monthly newsletter that is geared to professionals working in the construction industry. In the newsletter, we seek to disseminate our research and insights, with the intention of moving the conversation in construction to being more evidence-based and data-driven. Our newsletter covers content across the spectrum in construction, from safety to productivity to strategic planning and more. We recently wrote this newsletter on Everyday Sexism in construction, pointing to this as a possible reason for women not entering the profession. Construction has a significant labor shortage at the moment. We also offer some insights for creating generative, women-inclusive cultures in construction. I share some of my own experiences as an academic, engineer, and woman on the street, as well. Please find the newsletter here: http://www.stevensci.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160417_Everyday-Sexism.pdf I am impressed with the positive response from our newsletter subscribers — most of them men, some women, and many in senior management or themselves owners of companies. This community wants to create the cultures we call for, and is committed to construction sites and construction firms being safe, welcoming, supportive places for women. I am constantly inspired by the resilience and smarts of construction professionals and workers, and I hope this conversation helps to galvanize them for the changes that need to happen in people’s hearts and minds, that will help us all to achieve this end.

"I’m a younger male, and am often called ‘sweetie’ or ‘darling’ by older (oft female) managers or coworkers, which feels slightly patronising. It happens to other young men in the department too.

I work behind a bar and two of the bartenders I work with used to slap my arse whenever they walked past me – I put a stop to this by forcefully kicking them every time it happened. In a male dominated workplace there is no one senior to turn to and while I am fine because they now ‘respect’ me as I’m almost ‘one of the lads’ an 18 year old waitress gets asked for a blowjob regularly by the chefs. 
"Question: Can I sit on a park bench, listen to my music and eat a sandwich? Answer: No. I’ll be interrupted by three different men who will each sit beside me, motion for me to remove my headphones then quiz me on my name, age, birthplace, workplace blah blah blah. I give them all the benefit of the doubt (maybe they’ll have something interesting to say?) then make it painfully obvious I’m bored and want to eat my sandwich in peace. I feel I can’t ask them to leave because that would be rude. It’s so boring, just leave me alone! "

"My sister and her husband, both in high-powered jobs in the financial sector, explain to me how challenging sexism in the workplace is bad for your career. The husband proceeds to explain how women can play on two types of look to get ahead in the workplace: the ‘sexy’ look, which is risky in case people think you’re a slut, and the ‘mummy’ look, which is much better. (How about the ‘competent employee’ look???) Frustratingly, I know they have a point – but I am also uncomfortable with reproducing the sexist status quo! "
"After a guy friend from my classes (who I trusted a lot and was convinced I had formed a great friendship with) came to my house uninvited and told me that he had feelings for me, I politely told him that I don’t see us as more than friends. He then came back with this comment. “When I was younger, if a girl friend zoned me, I would be like no, fuck that, I don’t need any more friends. But now that I’m older I’m okay with staying friends with you even though you friend zoned me.” Oh really, after going to these lengths and making me extremely uncomfortable at my classes and in our friend group, you will do me the honor of remaining friends with me?! I was outraged by the use of the term “friend-zoned” as it shifted the blame to me for not being interested. I was also outraged because it seemed to me that this guy was just forming this friendship with the end goal of dating me. Not cool. "
"I was listening to Radio 4 while driving to pick up my daughter from University and I was CHEERING you Laura and SHOUTING at Edwina Currie. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I have the utmost admiration for what you. Having grown up in the 70s it pains me that in 2016 I am constantly hearing the phrase ‘It’s a witch hunt’ in relation to harassment/sexual touching/serious sexual assaults etc. As a young girl and teenager during that era I know it was everywhere. We should be pleased that victims now feel emboldened to come forward. Still, I suppose there is no media story in that and it is yet again another example of insidious control being exerted in subtle ways. I wish you every success with the project. "
"I have many examples that I experienced over the last month… – A friendship request on facebook: “No gorgeous you don’t know me. I don’t know you. But I like what I see. Add me as a friend, let’s stay in touch”. After my answer, that was a very clear “No thanks”, he replied back with this: “You must be pretty ugly, if you were a pretty girl you’d be flattered”. – While running and sweating all over the pub on a busy day at work and short of staff, a customer grabs my arm and says: “Easy darling, eaaasy”. – Carrying heavy beer boxes at work, again a customer: “Hey honey, you should smile more, you’d look prettier”. – I don’t usually wear makeup, and at a party at work I wore some eye mask and blush: “Heeey, wow! you see how you can look lovely just with some extra make-up”. – After firmly asking my flatmate, to fix something he did: “Ok, ok, calm down, I’ll go check, and, if there’s a situation, I’ll deal with it”. First, can’t a firm woman be calm? I’m tired of that, second, you’re assuming my judgement was poor and so, you have to re-check, I’m telling you, there IS a pretty gross situation, go and clean the bloody toilet. – The tipical “grgggrrrrrhhh….” at your ear when you walk alone. – I work on a pub, I am the bartender and manager at the bar, you know, the boss there and the one making cocktails and stuff. We have a new guy at the pub and I have him with me carrying heavy boxes and preparing the ice, well, male costumers ask me for beer and “easy drinks” and they all ask him for cocktails. When I say “I’ll make it for you” they would say something like this: “Sorry honey I was talking to the bartender, do you want to drink something with me and talk?”, when I say that I am the bartender, they just laugh. – The flirting situation that ends with me leaving the place without the guy and he shouts: “F*** lesbian!”. Since when the word “lesbian” is an insult?, why a woman not interested on them “must be” lesbian? I don’t get it. – A guy licked my neck at the metro, I turned back and there were three guys, they weren’t together, but still, none of them said a word when I asked. And I could keep writing. "
"I’m 20 years old. I’m in charge of a team of people at my workplace and during one shift, a boy about the same age as me, possibly slightly older began chatting with another girl in my unit about his sexual habits. I didn’t think this conversation was necessary to have in work and asked him to get back to serving customer, he then told me that the girl he was chatting to was his girlfriend so it didn’t matter. I still insisted he stop the conversation as it was inappropriate in the workplace and he then proceeded to inquire about my sexual habits and my own romantic life. Once again I told him this was inappropriate in work and also none of his business. The boy made a comment about how he thought I would definitely be into kinky sex and then turned around. My workplace is quite cold and so to stay warm I tend to lean over a low oven that is in my unit and so about 15 minutes after our conversation, this boy looked at me bent, shivering over the oven and said “please don’t bend over, it’s distracting”. I laughed in shock and said I was cold to which he replied “I bet that wall is getting a lovely eyeful there”. I felt extremely uncomfortable and moved away from him and the oven. At the end of the shift, while I was cashing up the rest of my teams tills, the boy walked behind me and as he did he brushed his hands down my shoulders and arms. He then walked behind me again in a different spot in the unit and ran his hands down my waist and onto the small of my back and bum. I became quite angry and told him to leave me alone, get back to work and not to speak to me again unless it was to do with a work inquiry. He obviously knowing he had gone too far, became defensive and asked why I was mad. I explained to him that he had been making me feel uncomfortable all shift and I wasn’t having it anymore. The boy didn’t let it go and started shouting about how his boss was bringing her personal life into work and taking out her personal frustrations on him. This wasn’t the case. I asked his girlfriend to calm him down and the boy then proceeded to call me a bitch and tell me that I need to learn how to take a joke. I didn’t speak to him again and he left my unit. I went home from work feeling extremely upset and quite frankly did not want to go to work again so I wrote an email to my boss explaining what had happened and asked my boss if he could never put this boy to work with me again. I realized as I was writing the email to my boss that I actually felt quite guilty over possibly getting this boy in trouble but my parents told me I needed to report this as I’d done nothing wrong and so I pressed send on the email. It’s been several months since I sent that email to my boss and I still haven’t had a reply off him or been approached in work regarding if they did anything about my complaint. It’s made me resent going to work at a job I once enjoyed. "
"A male co-worker and I were discussing another co-worker (female) who is a really awful person to work with. My points were all about how uncooperative or self-centered she is. He responded with, “Yeah and I don’t understand how she’s gotten people to like working with her. She’s not attractive!” He was the only people at work that I felt I could actually talk to, and then that happened and I realized he’s like everyone else. And he doesn’t even have the education/resources to know how terrible that kind of comment is. "
"I had been temping for a corporate company for several months, and on my last day the head of HR called me into his office for what I thought would be an exit interview. I had graduated the summer before and was at a fairly low point, struggling to even get interviews, and he had always shown what I thought was a professional interest in me, asking about what I hoped to do in the future. Turns out it wasn’t a professional interest – in this meeting he basically made a pass at me, said some very uncomfortable things about how he felt out about me, and told me we should meet up in the next few weeks. I binned his business card as soon as I left, and tried to put it out of my mind. However, over the next few weeks he persistently tried to contact me online, sending me messages and asking old colleagues to get in touch with me. What shocked me was how most of the people I told who had more experience in the workplace were unsurprised – many saw this as typical behaviour of a lot of men in senior positions in corporate companies. It shook my self-confidence at first, as I felt I must have brought it on myself, and it was only a while later that I realised that this guy was completely inappropriate. I think women are wrongly encouraged to accept that this kind of behaviour is a fact of working life, rather than harassment, and this stops us from complaining, as we assume we will either to be told that it is our fault or that we should just put up with it.

"Ever so often when I, an early career academic, work together with male colleagues they imply that their priorities, and hence their work, are more important that mine, and that they are busier than me, even when we are on the same career level and have the same amount of duties. This is also true for some of my friends, who tend to be men rather than women: whenever we envisage a meeting, it is them who wish to set the priorities. Of course I do make it clear that I have my priorities as well. But this is rarely taken as a given. "
In the 70s when I started my nurse’s training one of the wardsmen would wait til we went into the pan room and trap us in there and grope us. We didn’t report it because the attitude was that we got ourselves into these situations and nice girls don’t get groped. 
"I’ve written about a co-worker who had mismanaged his time when closing being amazed that I could actually do my job (which required some heavy lifting) because I’m a woman. He was so stunned because when he had FINALLY finished his work at 5 to closing, he had thought he would have to finish mine for me too. Cos women are weak amirite? A few weeks ago, he had once again mismanaged his time and this time I offered to help to get everything closed on time. He very insistently refused my help and, when I questioned him on it, he readily acknowledged that he didn’t want help from a woman and that he would have accepted male help. Last week, the same co-worker mismanaged his time to an even worse extent. It was about 5 to closing again and this co-worker of mine was still a decent bit away from closing his shop correctly. Fortunately for him, there were 2 other (male) co-workers of ours present at the time. So all three of us come over to assist him. He complains the entire time about my assistance while not saying a word to/about the assistance of our co-workers. He said I’m “crazy” for doing physical work. Only one of these other co-workers challenged him and pointed out that women can do anything that men can do and to stop being so damn sexist. This challenge from another male did the trick and he promptly shut up shit-talking me. I’ve told him to stop being sexist in the past and it’s just prompted him to keep calling me “crazy” etc. "

"I work as an NQT teacher at a college, and we store laptops in cabinets within locked classrooms. One time, a student found me and asked me if I could open the door to let him and his male friends put their laptops back in the class. He and his friends were quite loud in the empty corridor, but I assumed ‘boys will be boys’ and ignored it as all classes had finished for the day. I was already on my way to that classroom as well to get a book. I opened the door, and one of his friends held it open whilst the others put the laptops away. I then tried to find the book I was looking for, but then I thought I heard one of his friends say something under his breath. I pretended to carry on searching for the book because I wasn’t sure if I heard it or not. Then I focused my hearing to it a bit more and realised he was whispering very rude, overtly sexual comments at me over and over again in his language (I speak this language as well, so I recognised it). What can anyone do in this situation? They were not my students, they were a group of young adult males who were all significantly larger than me, and they made me feel completely insignificant and scared. In retrospect it would be easy to confront them, but in an empty corridor with no other teachers in view, it’s clear that I have a lot more to learn as a teacher than what my classes can teach me. "
"I am a father of one daughter and some sons. I am also part of an the construction industry that as I am now realizing for the first time is very or even extremely discriminatory toward woman specifically and in general. I am ashamed that I have not spoken out before. But as I think of my daughter and the struggles she would have to endure if she wanted to follow in my foot steps I know I would not tolerate anyone abusing her if I was aware of it. Men we have daughters, mothers, sisters and friends who are possible victims of this type of discrimination we must be a part of the solution and make life easier for women to live life without fear of being abused by some men’s discriminatory attitudes, behavior and abuse. Unfortunately it is so normalized in the construction industry even women can add to the problem because it seems to some it is un-lady like to participate in a so-called mans world of construction. Again if my daughter had so wanted to follow in my foot steps it would not be a pleasant ride for her. It is time for us to change the work environment for women especially in construction. The construction industry could only benefit. I have been in this industry for over 35 years, so I have seen a lot we need this kind of positive change. A Father "
"After my mother died my father started sexually abusing me. I was only five years old. I was 12 when I finally told the teacher. The police got involved and I was removed out of the house. After 5 years in the court system , he got 1year and got out in 9 months for good behavior.Still many people tell me it was because I reminded him of my mom that he did it. It was never his fault. "
"A few weeks back my wonderful mother, who raised me as equal to my brothers, encouraged me in everything I did and is a vocal supporter of equality, broke down in tears while walking home from town with me. I’ve rarely seen her cry. Shes a primary school teacher, and told me that at the staff Christmas party her male colleague spiked her drink and then proceeded to try to snog and grope her. The other staff just sat by drunkenly laughing. They thought it was funny because my mum doesn’t drink and they thought it would be amusing to see her off her face. When he tried to grab her they thought it was funny to see her ‘out of control’. Whats most fucked up is that my mum thinks its her fault. She took months to tell me what happened, even longer to tell my brothers why she was scared to go back to work. She was scared to bring it to the head for fear her colleagues would hate her. My mother raised me to see sexual harassers as scum, but still thinks its her fault when men treat her badly. For reference, shes in her late 50s. This isn’t something exclusive to ‘young attractive girls who dress provocatively’. "

"I worked within a marketing consultancy for 3 years during which time I was subjected to regular sexist comments regarding my clothing (which became more and more conservative in an effort to avoid this), women’s potential in the workplace and questions about my sex life. I was also groped on a number of occasions by older male colleagues, one of which had been assigned as my mentor, who also told me that I was too confident for a girl of my age and experience and suggested that I behave in a more submissive way to appear more approachable to my male colleagues. I relieved him of his duties. Towards the end of my time there, I found out that a junior male colleague who was known to be lazy and unproductive was earning a substantial amount more than I was. I brought it to the attention of the company, who said that he had ‘other interests to support’ (his own small business) whereas I should consider myself lucky to be earning so much as a single female. I handed in my resignation. "
"This is a long one, chatting to a friend last night and wondering when calling someone a feminist became an insult has spurred me on to share my story. I’m an engineer, I have a good degree and a doctorate so I’m not scared to hold my own in a male dominated environment, and I have to say, for the majority of my career so far I haven’t encountered any sexism at all. Apart from in my last job. I work in electronics manufacturing, and have to work a lot with the factory operators. In my last job I often worked night shifts, and it was brought to my attention at around 3am one night by a (female) technician that I’d been receiving some unwanted attention from one of the operators. She informed him he stood no chance with me, I had just got engaged and told him, less than politely, to leave me alone. I appreciated the gesture and her sticking up for me. About a month later, one of my colleagues (male) informed me that said operator had been referring to my arse and what he would like to do to it. Saying things such as her fiance is one lucky bloke etc. What shocked me about this more than anything is my colleague and I were close, I saw him as a father figure and he knew this, yet he let the operator talk about me like this as if it was ok. And I let it happen because of some ridiculous notion that it is just workplace banter. Thinking back now, I worked in a clean room, we wore full clean room boiler suits, with a hood and a mask so only my eyes were visible. He had never seen me out of the clean room, in my office so didn’t know what I looked like. All he knew about me was that I was a young female. So for all of those people out there who like to blame the female and say she asked for it because of the way she looks or dresses, then what was this person’s motivation? My biggest ‘crime’ was being nice to people. But he certainly wasn’t interested in my personality. I’m not at all sad to report this person has since lost his job. I’ve regretted ever since that I didn’t take a stand and report him. Now, I told you this was a long one… Next is my relationship with the equipment engineers. Like I say, I work in a male dominated environment and I do believe some level of banter is to be expected (not of the sexist kind by any means, most of these guys were very respectful individuals). For some reason, two of these guys took a dislike to me. One of them from the start and one of them later on. Now, they were widely known to be a bit difficult to work with, however, the way they treated me goes beyond the pale and was instrumental to me leaving – though not the only reason. A few examples are not answering their phones to my number but if I rang back straight away from my colleague’s phone, they’d answer straight away. Rolling their eyes at me if I asked for help on a piece of equipment. If I asked a direct question, answering me but be looking at the nearest male while doing it. Talking in a very sexually explicit manner in front of me, not about me, but clearly to get a response from me. Once again I din’t say anything and once again I regret it. I’ll never let anyone treat me like that again. I have recently started a new job, again in a male dominated environment. It is an old company and a lot of my colleagues are well over 50 and a more respectful group of people I have never met. Not once have they ever made reference to my gender or my age. I had a small problem with someone speaking to me quite disrespectfully, he spoke to everyone like that, I’m not alone, but I vowed never to let anyone treat me like I have been treated so I firmly said ‘I will not put up with you speaking to me like that, you will not raise your voice and you will have the respect for me that I have for you’ and he has been nice as pie since. Speak out girls – feminism is about wanting equality. Let’s go get it! "
"– When I was six, one of my mom’s teenage piano students molested me by trying to act out pornography he’d seen with me. He told me if I told anyone what had happened, I would get in trouble. The only reason my parents found out is because my little brother was in the room when it happened, and he said something about it the next day. – There was a sub in my freshman science class that liked to touch the girls. He touched my fingers one time to “help me count,” and then he “helped” me find an answer in the textbook by standing behind me and encircling me in his arms while he flipped through the pages. I reported this to the principal and asked him to never let this man sub for my science class again. The principal seemed agreeable, but a few weeks later that sub was back in my class. – In my sophomore science class, I had another sub that hit on me (different school than my freshman year). He called me “Ms. Blue Eyes” and sat on the edge of my desk to talk to me. I didn’t think anything of it, but my friends said it was creepy and weird, and I realized that they were right and he was being inappropriate. – In this same science class, there were only 6 girls out of just over 20 students. One boy took one of my school pictures and stuck it down his pants without my knowing, then ejaculated on it. I didn’t really understand what had happened, only that another girl was grossed out and another boy in the class was laughing when it happened. I simply stuck the picture back in the rest of my picture package, and never told any adults about it because I was embarrassed, and I didn’t know what “jizzing” was. – When I failed my first AP Statistics test in high school, my dad said it was because I’d always been able to rely on my looks before to get good grades, but it wasn’t going to work with this teacher (he was gay). Most of my teachers leading up to this point had been female, by the way, so I guess they were all queer. – At a New Year’s party my freshman year of high school, a guy grabbed my butt when I walked by him. I pushed his hand away. – When I lived in China, I worked as a model for a car show one day. Some of the men wanted to take pictures with me, and one man moved the hand of the man I was taking a photo with over my breast. I said “No” with a glare while they were laughing. The guy I was actually taking a picture with didn’t seem to find the situation very funny, either. – I substitute teach at a middle school, and have been sexually harassed by 7th grade boys. They just think it’s funny, and then they get pissed at me when I get them in trouble for the comments that they make to me, and they try to blame me for them getting in trouble rather than realizing that they need to be held responsible for their actions. – I was in a production for a play recently, and I wore my hair in a ponytail one day at rehearsal. The next day I wore my hair down again, and one of my male costars said, “Oh good, your hair is down today. I didn’t like it your hair up in the ponytail yesterday.” This isn’t the first time a man has remarked that he likes my hair better down than up. It is not my purpose in life to be aesthetically pleasing to the people around me. These probably aren’t every single sexist thing that’s ever happened to me, but these are the most memorable. Obviously, some of these are worse than others, but that’s the worst part. Sexism has become so ingrained in our society that often times no one realizes that it’s happening to them. I didn’t for a long time, but now I do, and I will never stop speaking out about it. "
"When I was 19 years old working my first job in auto sales, my first day, I was about to walk over to a customer and two other young salesmen grabbed me by each arm and held me back so their buddy could get the customer. I told my manger and he laughed. I was the only female sales rep and the youngest person there. It didn’t matter that I was the top of my sales training class and knew more about the engines, specs and cars then anyone else. They harassed me all the time until after a year I finally quit. "
"Reading some comments via the #whenIwas hashtag got me thinking about some of my own experiences. Here are those that came to mind in about 10 minutes. the list is not exhaustive: #whenIwas 8 a man walking towards me and my mum suddenly bent down in front of me and took a photograph of me #whenIwas 10 a family friend bought me earrings #whenIwas 14 the same family friend was asked to leave a jumble sale I was volunteering at and he was lurking at #whenIwas 13 a man pulled up his car in front of me and a friend – he was masturbating #whenIwas 16 my friendâ€™s stepdad kissed me goodnight on the lips when I was staying at his house and smacked my bum as I went upstairs #whenIwas 18 a motorcycle slowed and the man on the front of it grabbed my breast before speeding off again #whenIwas 18 a man waved his penis at me through a cafÃ© window #whenIwas 19 my ex boyfriendâ€™s best friend pinned me down on a bed. I forced him off. I was later interviewed by the police about a rape accusation against him #whenIwas 23 and stood with a new group of friends in a very busy bar a man put his hand up my skirt – it was crowded and I couldnâ€™t see who he was so I didnâ€™t tell anyone. #whenIwas 23 a colleague told the rest of our team that we were sleeping together. We werenâ€™t. He told them I wanted to keep it a secret because the things we were doing were so kinky. He told them we were in a relationship and arranged for us to be given a shared bedroom when we were working away. I thought he was my closest friend. #whenIwas 29 a man stretched out his elbows next to me on the tube and slowly started pressing one elbow against my chest and then rubbing it up and down #whenIwas 30 I was regularly called â€œdarlingâ€? and â€œflowerâ€? and â€œsweetheartâ€? by two men who were a lot older than me and yet whose work I was responsible for reviewing. Ironically, we screening job candidates for racism, homophobia and, yes, sexism. These are just a few that I could think of and a few I felt comfortable saying (there are others that I didnâ€™t). The list doesnâ€™t include the multiple wolf whistles, â€˜cheer upâ€™sâ€™, leering, suggestive comments, situations I evaded, boyfriends and partners pushing against the word â€˜noâ€™. And, truly, compared to so many other women, my experiences are very insignificant. Theyâ€™re pretty average, I would bet. "
"male colleague once told me he imagined me in sexually explicit situations in the workplace. Then described them to me. the reply I took was to fight sexual harassment in the workplace. Took my case to my boss. Guy was let go. Put a case together to make sure of that. Spoke to other women, he’d done similar things but not as full on. It doesn’t make any difference whether it’s someone you know or not. People have to learn respect. it baffles me that “treat others how you want to be treated” is so complex for some. "
"My workplace: Civil Engineering. A male engineer’s wife was in labor. He was calling in with ‘updates’. Two young engineers began (I kid you not) squealing with loud laughter all the while saying- “She’s only dialated to a one and she’s screaming for an epidural! Can you even believe it!” laugh, laugh, squeal. My manager decides to join in: “I remember I was driving around with my wife and she kept saying: ‘I think I might be in labor.’ So we finally went to the hospital and they said: ‘Let’s getcha up on the table.’ My daughter was born 20 minutes later.” (You can imagine where the young engineers went with the ‘Lets getcha up on the table.’ bit. The talk of women in labor deteriorated even further. Year: 2012, Orange County, California "

The message I got from the meeting was if I couldn’t handle the situations other workers put me in, then leave. "
"On the first few days at my workplace some boys were snickering about raping the females working there and proceeded to discuss in detail who they most wanted to rape and how they’d do it, speaking in obscene explicit language and referring to the girls as sluts, whores, or bitches or commenting on how they were asking for it.

"When I was 9 I was molested and threatened by my friend’s dad. When I was 9 I started to be emotionally abused at home. When I was 20 I was physically abused by my uncle at home bad enough to where I called for help and had to receive physical therapy. When I was 23 I was asked to take pictures of my privates and send them to him by a coworker, to me just being asked that made me feel like he was touching me. When I was 23 almost 24 I was physically abused by a coworker to wear I had to file a report and I had to wear a neck brace. "
"My mom has always been a working woman. In the late 80s/early 90s, she worked at a company local to our city. She had graduated from college in 1985, so she was young and one of the few people at that company with a college education. She was fairly high up in the company, and had many people working under her. Because of her degree and previous work experience, she demanded that she get a raise because she was being paid dirt cheap in comparison to most other men in the company, even the ones who were less qualified and the ones who had a lower position than her. The company agreed to the raise, but she had to go on the executive payroll because it was private, while the regular payroll could be seen by anybody. The only people who knew her salary were the president and CFO of the company. She had to be on the private executive payroll because the president understood that if other male workers knew how much she, as a woman, was making (even though she was more qualified than them), they would throw a riot. Nobody besides the president and CFO knew why she was on the executive payroll. They all just assumed she was sleeping with a top executive. So, she didn’t end up getting harassed because of her salary–she ended up getting harassed and called slut, bitch, whore, gold digger, etc by men because they thought she was banging an executive. "
"At my last workplace all the employees got a book for the summer holiday. Nice thought, but the women got chick lit and the men got a criminal novel. I, for one, hates chick lit, but love criminal novels and I got offended. Why not let everyone choose which book they preferred instead of assuming their preference was decided from what genitalia they had? Told the company but got no real explanation. "
"At university we had to do a project, the two men (boys really, only 19) in the group arsed about and didnt turn up for meetings on time, or turned up having done nothing, then refused to cooperate at all once I took charge. I hadnt intended to push myself forward but they were so hopeless. In the end, the other woman and I had to do all their work, including the practical stuff and the written report, or we all lost the credit that we all needed. They got the same credit marks as it was officially a group exercise, but the entire project was done by us two women. In retrospect it was a perfect introduction to the workplace. Carry the mediocre males who sulk if you are in charge but don’t want to do any work themselves. Hobsons choice – What do you do, lose the marks that you need? Even though you have to do the mans share too? "
"Summer job, boss was a 50 year old. I was 21. He chased me around the desk. But I was faster. My mom in her job learned to drop to the ground when someone grabbed for her chest. She got the office mgr job and was paid half what men in that job were. "
"Male boss at work became so mad at me regarding something work-related that he flew off the rails and started screaming at me. In a closed room where the door jams and can only be opened from the inside. I felt unsafe and was looking around the room trying to decide what to throw at him in case he attacked me. On bringing this up to management, they said I was making a big deal out of nothing. 2 days later they fired me and asked me to leave the very same day, knowing full well I can’t stay in the country without the work pass sponsored by them.

"The abortion debate I did sound for recently. Which was dominated by one male speaker who barely let anyone else get a word in, and kept trying to interrupt his female opponent (thankfully the chair wasn’t having that). My favourite point of his: that workplace discrimination was the women’s fault for not fighting against it harder, and that the solution was to ban abortions. "
"Knowing that if I wasn’t overweight, I would be getting sexually harassed in the street, in bars, and in the workplace like other women are. Bumper stickers that say “no fat chicks”. Obesity is far more dangerous for men’s health than it is for women, yet no one seems to comment on or judge men for being overweight. "
"I am a mature woman and experienced manager. I take pride in being an advocate for and sponsoring younger people at work. I have been a firm supporter of a young woman of extraordinary character and above average job performance. Recently I was told by my boss to ‘be careful who I advocate for,’ as his boss and others did not think much of her potential. I was both insulted that my experienced opinion carried so little weight and also felt my support/job evaluation was being threatened. I continue to be a visible supporter of hers and she is proving them more wrong everyday. My bosses all the way up to the CEO are men.My colleagues are 90% men. I feel that my boss is trying to drive a wedge between me and other women of influence – I therefore always give the woman the benefit of the doubt! "
"I’m a waitress and its assumed that sexual harassment is a constant thing that is always around. Usually I dress in black slacks, black button up men’s shirt, a tie, and a shin length apron. Then I started working the front desk and wearing my regular clothes. My direct supervisor said I looked sexy and grabbed my waist. Other male servers looked at me like I was a new person and had never stepped foot in the club before. I had been working there for months with no issues. I feel like meat when I walk into the kitchen. "
"When I was about 18, I was sexually harassed by my department supervisor ~ he pinned me up against a wall and tried to grope me. My immediate supervisor (also male) accused me of willingly participating in a sexual act and physically assaulted me. I reported them to the store operations manager (another male) and was told ‘Well, it’s not like you work in cosmetics.’ I quit right then and there. I sometimes forget about this one because, honestly, there have been more than I can count. "

"I left a professional job (that I’d had for a long time, and was very successful at) suddenly when a colleague’s spouse raped me. I took a short-term job with someone who liked my work and was enthusiastic about helping me find another job. On one occasion, my boss introduced me to someone they thought might be interested in hiring me. As soon as my boss walked away, he began make make degrading, sexually suggestive comments to me. I laughed, in part because I was triggered, but also because I knew how badly I needed a job and didn’t want to make him angry. And he knew that, I realize, and that’s why he did it, because he enjoyed having that power over me. I’m writing this because I still feel guilty for laughing. "
"This week I lost my job because I stood up to a male aggressor at work. I was told I should have been “sweet” with him. I was asked to consider if I had provoked the conflict. And I was asked if I could see that I was engaging in “tit for tat”. When I firmly denied this, and asserted that I had not spoken to him the way he had spoken to me, I was told I was incapable of seeing another perspective. When I said I didn’t believe he was “just joking around” because I knew other colleagues who had dealt with his aggression, I was reprimanded for speaking to my colleagues about this. When I said “there are no circumstances in which it is ok to tell a woman she should be SWEET to a man intimidating and belittling her” I was told my “strong opinions” probably didn’t have a place in the company and I was fired. I gave the company every opportunity to consider that terminating me was unethical, and it fell on deaf ears. I offered to workshop ways to address the problem. My offer was ignored. In my termination interview I was explicitly told there was NOTHING WRONG WITH MY PERFORMANCE. I loved this job and I loved the people but I will NOT be silent on such blatant sexism, on such a clear and undeniable example of a culture that excuses male violence, both physical and verbal (because they come from the same sense of entitlement) and asks women to be quiet about it, and punishes them for speaking out.

Loose Women: â€œShould women just accept that workplace harassment is a hazard of the job?â€? WHAT THE FUCK?! 
"My workplace (on more than one occasion) has hired men from outside the company, rather than let hardworking women from inside the company progress, as it fits their profile and brand image better. I have seen these 3 men leave after a short period as they were not cut out for the job. If management weren’t so blinded by the attitude that men represent their brand more they would see that the people that represent their brand are the WOMEN who come into work every day and work their socks off because they are passionate about their jobs and very capable people.

"I worked at a restaurant and was sexually harassed by one of the kitchen guys. There was only one other woman and one trans-man that worked there before me. The man had transitioned during his time at the restaurant. The restaurant was and is extremely male dominated. When I filed my report against the man who harassed me my manager said, “I’m sorry, we don’t normally deal with this kind of thing. We have Sarah and Ren, but you know… You’re the first real woman to work here. Do you know what I mean?” Not only is it offensive to the trans man being referred to as a woman, but to Sarah for not being attractive enough in his eyes to be considered a woman. It was one of the most sexist things I had ever heard in such a casual way. Fucking disgraceful. I filed a complaint against him with the EEOC. When I was interviewed by the EEOC employee he interrogated me and belittled my complaint. I told him management did not try to make my work environment safe. He said “When you tell a man no he is going to be angry, you gotta be ready to deal with that.” Like the whole thing was my fault. I filed a complaint against him to his boss too. Maybe I wasted my time, this process took months, but I refuse to sit back and let people treat me or other women like shit just because we are women. "
"My boss likes to speak over me in meetings or play on his phone when I’m talking. Other female colleagues have noticed him do the same to them. I’ve tried speaking to him about it. He acknowledges it at the time and apologises for “upsetting” me, but then next meeting it’s the same deal. Regently, I sent a big piece of work I’d done to him for feedback. He proceeded to give feedback to my junior male colleague within my earshot. Apparently, despite the email coming from me, it was inherently obvious that work of that quality had come from another man in the team. Unsurprising really that the junior male colleague tells me he’s booking other people in to represent the organisation at events because they’re more qualified, despite the advice of a female director that I’m the right person for the job. Classic case of trickle-down sexism. "
"We were in a manager’s meeting and I was one of only 2 females out of 9 people. When it came for a coffee break the MD looked at us and said “take orders for drinks and biccies, please ladies”. I couldn’t believe it. We are both more senior than at least 3 of the guys but we had yo go get the drinks like we were the most junior in the room. "
"Having worked my way up through an organisation a which I joined as a PA, I was running a practice and engaging regularly with CEO’s and Directors for Business Development and Delivery. In my late 20’s (not so long ago!), I took care of my appearance, but looked smart and professional (unlike many of my male counterparts) but was careful to balance, being well turned out, with not too glamorous! I found myself leading a regional practice when my two bosses left and whilst they tried to take me with them, I maintained my commitment to my current employer and was keen to develop my own market, take up their mantel and, in fact work in direct competition with my two former employers. I did this successfully on a temporary basis for a number of months, with no discussion or involvement from above. Then a Director asked for a meeting, casually put his feet up on the desk and suggested I take a secondment into a wider part of the business that dealt with a different (lower level, higher volume) type of work. He said that the fact that I looked young and was a pretty woman meant I was less likely to have credibility with the CEO’s and Directors that I needed to impress on a daily basis. Apparently getting experience in a different environment (where I would be 4-5 steps removed from any decision makers) should give me the credibility I needed???! I politely told him that I thought he ought to discuss the suggestion with HR before putting anything in writing. I was gobsmacked that my looks and age could be held against me in an environment where I had already proved my worth. THis made me even more driven and I made a huge success of my market, despite the hurdles and perceived barriers! "
"I work in a home decor store and there’s a lot of organization and image that goes along with it. Once, a fellow female coworker and I were hanging paintings on hooks coming down from the ceiling and we were having quite a difficult time with it, having to hang a painting in each direction on these two hooks. We couldn’t quite manage to get them to line up properly and handed the project off to our more-experienced manager. As we were walking away to continue our usual work, my coworker turned to me and said “You can definitely tell a couple of women hung that painting.” I was too shocked to formulate a response at the time. As time went on, I began notice that comments like this were unnervingly common, but only among the female staff. "
"I did a week of temp work several months ago and it was wrought with unpleasant experiences: On the first day I was there, the manager came to the lobby to collect his employees and didn’t even look in my direction because of course the 18-year-old girl wouldn’t be here for the manual labor job, but the three other gentlemen would be (never mind that the slip said he would be given four workers and there were only four people in the lobby). When work was assigned, I’m given the ‘secretary work’ without a second thought. We’re packing prize boxes with shirts and things and my job is to estimate how many shirts each of seven sizes we should put in each box. After I give him my estimations, he tells me that I wasn’t supposed to use the sizes above Large (“especially for the women’s shirts, they’d be very upset about getting a shirt that size” <- actual quote FROM THE MANAGER) which I was not told of beforehand. On the Saturday we worked, the group attitude was a little too casual. I'd joined the packing effort once my quantity number had improved and i was folding shirts very neatly in order to make sure they'd all fit in the boxes. An obligatory comment on how I must be good at laundry was made. Later in the day, the oldest of us–we'll call him Chris–told us a story: he'd recently had to move out of his roommate's apartment so the roommate's girlfriend could move in. A week or so later he decided to go back to the apartment unannounced to pick up some things he'd left behind. He let himself into the apartment without knocking, where his ex-roommate's girl was pants-less and lounging around HER apartment. Chris openly ogled her and told her she has nice legs, which she responded to by asking him to leave–again–HER APARTMENT. He grabbed his things in a huff and left, and seemed to legitimately not understand why his friend sent him an angry text about it and hadn't spoken to him since. End gross terrifying story. Still later they asked me if I was seeing anyone. I tend to avoid talking about my love life around people I don't know (especially older men) because, as I am a lesbian, it tends to get uncomfortable for me. After asking me about boys for several minutes, one of them catches on to my disinterest and figures I'm probably gay, which I reluctantly affirm to since I'm an awful liar. The conversation went something like this: Jim: ""Oh that's alright. It's hotter with two girls anyway."" Me: ""You know that doesn't actually make me feel better, right?"" Jim: ""Whatever. I'm just saying I'd be down to watch."" Me: ""How would you feel if I told you I was only okay with your marriage if I thought it'd be hot to watch you and your wife have sex? It's super creepy!"" Jim: ""That's just how guy's brains are. Get used to it."" ~~ Todd: ""So have you just like. Never been with a guy? Me: ""I've been with a couple. I've just never really liked any of them."" Todd: ""Okay, but how do you know you haven't just found the right guy?"" Me: ""How do you know Chris isn't the right guy for you?"" Todd: ""Oh, that's gross. I'm totally not gay."" Me: giving a very pointed look at Todd Todd: ""Okay but it's different with girls."" ~~ Todd: ""Can you even think guys are attractive?"" Me: ""Of course I can. I'm gay, not blind."" Todd: ""Do you think I'm attractive?"" Me: exasperated sigh as I go back to working There were a few other things that happened throughout the week but these were the ones that stuck out to me the most. I'm sorry if this post is long. "
"An email goes out to all staff at my workplace about someone leaving the company. Lots of people reply, saying how much they’ll miss this man, and they’ll never forget the time he did X and Y. I have to sit on my hands to stop myself replying to all that I too will never forget all the times he made sexually inappropriate comments and suggestions to me. How it got so bad that I would take a female colleague to meetings with me, rather than be alone with him. How when another female employee complained about him and I had to speak to him, he threatened to resign, and the male CEO bent over backwards to keep happy. Still, he’s popular with the male employees, and they’ll be sad to see him go. That’s all that matters, right? "

On multiple occasions when a man has asked me where I work, and I say the name of the tire company, their response has been, “Oh, are you the receptionist?” Because apparently that is the only thing a woman would know how to do in a male-dominated workplace. And during my first week of employment, the husband of our office manager stopped in. Upon meeting me, he puts his arm around me and makes a crack about how “we need to fatten her up.” This same man, who was grilling burgers for our company picnic, took a look at another woman and I (who were getting some fresh air nearby), proceeded to grunt suggestively and make it obvious he was looking us up and down while we stood there.

"I had this legendary collegue during my working time in an insurance company. He summed up his own world-view perfectly with these words: “If my girlfriend would earn more money than me, I couldn’t take it. I would split up with her immediately.” Yeah â€¦ So, this collegue tried any opportunity to molest me and a co-worker of mine verbally, whenever he could. Rating our bodies, making inappropriate comments, asking us for photos or coffee, and if there was a problem, blaming it on our incompetence as women. Oh, and he was saying I would make my future man very happy if I get rid off my “dominant moods”. We were 18 and 19, my co-worker and I, he was around 27, with a fixed working place in the company and in a fixed relationship. Which didn’t stop him from having wild sex-fantasies where I’d play the lead role in a Lara Croft Cosplay, as I had bigger breasts than my co-worker. I found that out thanks to my other manly collegues, as he could not keep his mouth shut before them. Me and my co-worker wouldn’t take it. We fought back with all we had. Which gave him too much attention sometimes, but in the end he was the only one embarassing himself and be the cause for jokes in the bureau. Thankfully, all of our collegues, men and women alike, would stand up if he took it too far. It was almost a little game, us scolding and biting at him. Which he liked and didn’t like at the same time; I will never understand what is going on in the heads of such dudes. Because it was pretty clear that he respected both of us for being hard workers AND beautiful women. He admired us. Yet he could only express his tasteless macho-gibberish which seemed oh-so-important for his “manhood”. The weirdest part was meeting his girlfriend, which I had imagined as a shy, silent girl, the pure definition of gender-clichÃ©. I was completeley wrong. She wasn’t shy. She was smart. She was eloquent. Beautiful and proud. She was everything that he would condem. And I thought to myself: What a pitiful, inexcusable farce. "

This man walks into my office daily whilst I am clearly working, sits down without being asked and talks at me about how right he is about everything.

"Being asked what I’m studying in college and when I say “physics” getting that sort of distanced, surprised smile and often even a slightly sarcastic, “good-for-little-you” remark. As if I’m a naive little puppy without any clue what I’m doing. As if it’s not my nature to want to study physics. As if they’re encouraging me for “giving it a try” as it most certainly cannot be what a “little girl” like me is actually passionately interested in and especially can’t actually be that good at it. I get some of the highest grades in my classes. Being told I’m too pretty, too girly, too fashionable, too cute, too artsy to be a physics major. Being told that I’m selfish for not wanting to do a more applied or engineering direction in physics. Because as I woman I must always want to do something that immediately and directly “helps” people, rather than just be a scientist who discovers new things and new knowledge about the universe and reality. Because a woman could never enjoy or find meaning in work that didn’t focus directly on helping people in some immediate way. Being told that I only got my physics scholarships because I’m a woman. Being told that my fellowship at a national, fully-paid, highly-competitive summer research internship was given to me only because I am a woman and they need to “fill their quotas.” Because I couldn’t have possibly gotten it for my passion and my merit and my scholarship. My genuine passion and hard work and talent and top grades have nothing to do with their decision to offer me this position. My white male physics-major friend mentioning how it is hard to be a white male in physics because no one wants to accept white males into graduate programs because they all need to make sure they are diverse. Like it is his to begin with and women and minorities are stealing his God-given spot. A woman couldn’t possibly get accepted because she deserves it just as much or more as he does. "
"I am a college student who works part-time in a grocery store bakery. A man came to the counter one Sunday and pointed at a cake and said, “Get me that one.” Suppressing my annoyance, I pulled the cake out of the display case and boxed it. I handed it to him and he said, “I wanted something written on it.” He must have sensed my irritation as I took the box back and became a little more hostile. Halfway through writing “Happy Birthday” in green buttercream frosting, I hear him say, “You’re very rough aren’t you? Women should be smooth.” "
"I work for a large ‘Household Name’ comapany, in a back office function. A team of 6 and I’m the only female at the moment. I have been told by a particular colleague that, after having a conversation with my husband on the phone, I should be more respectful in the way that I speak to men and asked why I am not at home to look after my husbands needs when he gets home from work. Many random suggestions of a woman’s place over the last 6 months. He has refused to to speak to me and dismissed me as ‘not being in my right mind’ when I raised an issue in a particular team meeting and been shouted at and dismissed when trying to speak. During a more recent team meeting, as soon as I made an observation about a subject he raised, he responded with ‘are you not feeling well today’. Of course it never happens when a manager team is in attendance. My colleague is lazy, that’s a fact admitted by our manager, he will only do what he has to from 9 to 5 with 1 hour lunch break. Everyone else picks up the slack and pulls together at times when needed, like when someone is on leave and their work needs to be done. He will spend hours on a task which should take only a few minutes and he spends more time away from his desk than he does working some days. The team is aware that he will cover up his mistakes rather than hold his hand up. While I was working from home recently he accused me of a serious error in a team meeting. I found this out when the manager on another team emailed me asking for an explanation of the error as he had to account for the financial cost to the company. When I came back into the office and confronted my colleague, he was more concerned with obtaining the email I had received. When I said it was irrelevant as it just asked about the error, I was accused of keeping secrets. He refused to explain why he had so publicly blamed me for his mistake (later, an email chain confirmed that he was fully aware he hadn’t done something properly at the time but had ignored it instead of sorting it out), even so he would not give any explanation for his actions, instead focusing and repeating about my secretive emails an bullying. I’m starting to feel paranoid about what else he’s saying about me when I’m not around. When I finally tried to talk to him in private about the whole situation between us (he wont talk in public at al) I couldn’t finish a sentence as he just spoke over me every time I started to say anything. I’m apparently embarrassing myself in front of my colleagues and should just remember stay quiet if I ever think I have anything to say. I’ve found out he has taken members of our team aside to complain to them about how I’m far too opinionated and should be at home, they then share this with me and tell me how awful his attitude is but but the funny thing is, whenever this person patronises me in meetings they all start into space and say nothing. He has tried to manipulate the newer team members into covering up his mistakes, something which have refused to do for him. The quote they have all shared from these ‘I’ve got your back talks’ is – if you cover up shit it doesn’t smell, if you uncover it, it goes everywhere. My boss and his boss are fully aware of what’s going on. There was a similar situation with the other female member of the team who is currently on maternity leave, I’ve apparently become his target. I had a hart to heart with another person in the office who is from the same country as my colleague as I thought the maybe I was had made cultural or religious mistakes that turned my colleague against me. He said that while he personally disagrees with my colleagues actions, in his country women are expected to serve their husbands and be quiet and obedient. Dealing with women in the UK is difficult because they are not like women back home. He also said that as my colleague has a military history he would be accorded respect and status back home, but finds it difficult that he is not treated like that in the UK within the workplace, made especially worse where female colleagues are of the same job title and grade. My colleague has already indicated to management that he is being bullied and suffering racism, citing the few people who continue to uncover his catalogue of mistakes or anyone complaining about his behaviour or laziness. Management seems to be more scared racism accusations than the way he is treating me because of his beliefs about the role of a woman. I do speak my mind. I just want to do my job well, I want our department to succeed and do the best for our customers. I used to be a strong person and love my work, but I dread going in now and I’m starting to think maybe I am the problem. I don’t know if this experience fits into this forum and I know I’m not the best writer in the world, but thank you for taking the time to read it. "
"About ten years ago I was declined promotion to the next professional grade because of a lack of relevant publications. That in itself was a reasonable decision. However the subsequent de-brief continues to niggle. The chair of the promotion panel invited a similarly-unsuccessful male colleague to lunch at his club. We, on the other hand, met in his office, where he advised me to â€˜hire a nannyâ€™ in order to get my publications written at the weekends. A fleeting comment but one which betrayed little understanding of childcare costs, parental responsibility and the pile of domestic jobs waiting for the weekend. What was so depressing was how much this seemed to say about workplace inequality in general and in my field in particular. Women far outnumber men at entry level but itâ€™s the men who end up managing us: a boysâ€™ club who mysteriously ensure that neither their families nor their finances impede their career progression. Since then Iâ€™ve made a series of sideways moves, learning along the way to look out for female seniority at the outset. "
"I’ve been writing lately about a male boss of mine. He regularly touches me inappropriately such as tickling etc. and he says disgusting things, such as “The weather is so up & down lately… just like Tarry in bed!” in front of my co-workers. Yesterday he was graphically advising a male colleague about how to perform cunnilingus upon the women with whom he is cheating on his long distance girlfriend, all the while maintaining eye contact with me and cackling. My male colleagues love him and are always joking and laughing with him no matter what he says or does. I’ve never heard one of them speak of him with even the mildest of criticism. All of this is run of the mill behaviour for this man. And yet, whenever my male colleagues criticise our bosses, it’s always our female boss, Tamara*, that they focus on. Tamara takes no shit, yet she is a very congenial, VERY fair woman. She knows what’s what and she’s not afraid to give orders and to speak her mind etc. I look up to her very much and she doesn’t give preferential treatment. Yet according to my male colleagues, she’s a bossy loud mouth who needs to be quieter and less imposing. They essentially think that she needs to “know her place”. Now, if you will, compare the creepy, inappropriate behaviour of my male boss and how he’s perceived with that of Tamara and how she’s perceived. Fuck this misogynistic bullshit. *Not her real name "
"Went for a second interview for a job as a mechanical engineer in a heavy industrial factory. I’ve worked in a similar setting as the only female engineer in a factory for the last 4 years, but the interviewer still felt he had to ask if it would be a problem for me working in an all male environment. I said I get on well with people and never had any problems in the workplace. The second panelist then said he had hired a woman recently and she said she missed female company, and would I not feel the same? I responded that having spent 8 years in a mostly male environment between university and work I was well used to it and would be fine, and that I expected a male nurse felt the same. They were both shocked by my answer and moved on to the next question. What I should have asked them was whether or not it would be a problem for them to hire a female engineer, and what was their HR policy for equality in the workplace. I was offered the job, but decided not to take it. "
"I was brought up to think that the days of 1950s sexism are over. Then I went to work, where I had a rude awakening. I have always worked in male-dominated fields. As a reporter, I was hit on by the managing editor of the first daily newspaper where I worked. The harassment started after he promised me a promotion. When I told him to stop, instead of promoting me, he hired a male friend with a background as a sandwich-maker to take my promotion. (There were other women at the paper he could have promoted also — but he wanted the sandwich maker.) I went on to work at a PR company. In my second week at the job the president of the company reached inside the pants of the vice president (female) of the company and pinched her butt cheek, making a comment about how big it was. This happened in the middle of a meeting. He was standing in front of a crowded conference table, as if he was acting in a play — making sure everyone could hear. I immediately resigned. I went back to school to get a second degree and the male head of the department pulled his chair next to mine and put his leg on my leg in front of 4 male students during a workshop. He repeatedly said things like “you’re a big girl” etc. Another male faculty member asked me to come to his computer and proceeded to show me a pornographic comedy video where a man made disgusting misogynist jokes. I went to the Dean of Students, an older man. His response to me was “we like to let the professors in the arts have leeway to teach with their own style.” I’m not joking. And he proceeded to tell me “it’s OK for you to cry. That’s what I’m here for.” God it makes me want to laugh, if it wasn’t so damaging to your life and your career. It is just out of control. I am a conservative person who does not dress in a provocative manner. So-called enlightened progressive men, and liberal religious men, are almost worse — because they are respected members of the community, but closet creeps. A man who chairs a meeting at a religious organization I am part of shoved his hand in my face to say “stop!” to get me to shut up as I was making a statement at the meeting. This same man seems to think it is OK to bring up the subject of “deviant sex” with me on the phone. Is their any way to get away from this? I do not know. "
"A female colleague and I, both quite new in our jobs at a respected law firm, got talking to a male business contact who had been invited to a busy work drinks event. Male business contact appears to be too interested in wrong kind of chat but we’re handling it just fine. Male partner in this law firm, our boss, comes to join the conversation and clearly knows this guy. His opening line: “How did I know I’d find you chatting to the ladies?”! Thanks, respectable boss, for undermining me and being jokingly accepting of your contact’s sleazy nature. Said contact then keep harrassing my friend over email after that day. Trying to get her to come for drinks late at night etc and not taking the hint when she declined politely. "
"I was a part-time receptionist at a small company. I cut my hair pretty short one summer. When the CEO saw it, he came up behind me while I was seated, grabbed the back of my hair and moved my head around for a moment while saying something like “your hair just makes me want to, oh that was probably inappropriate”. I froze, he walked away, but I still think of it every time he walks behind me. "
"My boss saw me reading your book Everyday Sexism and asked me about it, so I told him about the content of the book and about what I had learnt recently about how women are portrayed in the media (I had recently watched the documentary “Miss Representation” and had been inspired to explore further). He told me I was adorable. "
"I took an internship at a well known horse breeding farm for one summer during college. One day it down-poured like crazy but we still had to get work done. I was the one who got to run out in the rain and bring in mares to check for pregnancy. Needless to say, I got soaked without being offered a rain jacket. I, and a guy that got drenched, were going to go home and change then come back to work. On the way out, I met the overall business owner, a man in his early 70’s and two other men I worked with. He proceeded to ask me if I had ever been in a wet t-shirt contest in front of those workers. I, shocked he would ask that, said no. Then a minute later, he asks me the same question, and again I said no. It was left at that and I made my way home to dry clothes. I was wearing a thick shirt that held up to the rain and I have very small breasts, and didn’t think I was anything to look at, and yet I still got asked if I had ever taken part in a contest that basically exposes women’s breasts. The even more ridiculous thing is that I feel like I have to explain what I was wearing, and the fact that being small-breasted, I have learned I should not be as likely to receive as much harassment as those well-endowed. My immediate response of embarrassment, of wanting to crawl away while being looked at, and of comparing myself to societal standards of what attracts men, is as terrible a thing to be conditioned to as accepting sexual harassment is.

"My grandad is leader of the local council in my area, recently he was talking about his early career as union leader at his workplace and, in particular, arguing for equal rights for female workers. His wife turns to him and asks why, if he was so keen on promoting womens’ rights in the workplace, did he tell her she should not work but stay at home to look after him and their multiple children. He doesn’t respond, she is told she is “nagging” by her children (including my parent) that she gave up her working life for. She puts up, she shuts up, just like she’s been made to for decades. The hypocrisy! "
"I am the only woman working at my student job on a college campus – all my coworkers, including my boss, are male. I have lost count of how many times a day I am treated like I am stupid or incompetent. I cannot figure out what I am doing to cause this mistreatment by my coworkers because, most of the time, my coworkers are so cocky (but also lazy) that they don’t take the time to make sure they do there jobs right, while I am always constantly double checking my work and doing my very best at every task I’m assigned. All the guys are ever concerned about is doing whatever they want to do at the time, and they complain like crazy when they have to do one single thing that isn’t their choice. I hardly ever complain about doing tasks at my job. I’ve taken out the trash, scrubbed tables and chairs and the floor, help everyone with everything. I constantly clean up after my messy coworkers, who have very little respect for their workplace. But yet I am condescended to every single day. I have never experienced this level of condescension before and I”m not really sure how to handle it. I’ve spoken to one coworker who I am friends with outside of work about this matter (he is one of the two who are the most guilty of this rudeness that I’m confronted with every day). I’ve made him aware of specific events where he has said things that were condescending and have told him how saying things differently or expressing a different attitude would have made the situation so much more amicable. I hate going to work now because I know I’m going to be made to feel stupid every time I’m there. It ruins my day! "
"Today I was approached by a man in the grocery store carpark. He was trying to sell me car products. I politely told him I was not his target market as I had a company car, and the fleet manager looked after all of the maintenance. Not to be dissuaded he responded “Ah, but these are cleaning products, many women love them for using around the house too, look how wonderful they are”. Without my permission he then started to demonstrate the wonders of his wax cleaning products on my car, while I was busy putting my groceries into the boot. Clearly he sensed my lack of interest and made one last attempt to build rapport “Company car, huh. So are you an HR manager?” The implication hung in the air- the only way a woman could be in a senior position, was if she was in HR. At this point I got into my car and drove away. There was so much wrong with the conversation, I didn’t even know where to start. "
"My officemate (who is biracial) was ‘asked’ to go to a client meeting with us ‘to look pretty.’ Mind, she is a smart lady from a good school. I discovered that she absolutely had nothing to do with the project. Nice as she is, she kept quiet about this huge waste of time. After all, being ‘pretty’ is a compliment– why would you be indignant about it. I felt I had to say a snarky joke to let the bosses know what happened here: “it’s a good thing she went to a good school to look pretty.” "
"I had no interest in piano. They say practice should start young so when I was in college, my grandmother finally showed her disappointment in me.

"Article on endemic sexism and groping in Westminster gets this response “I wonder how many females take advantage of their sexuality to “get on” or receive preferential treatment in the workplace? Far more than have received unwanted attention I bet… one of these days we might actually get to read an article from a male perspective for once.” “The naughty archbishop and the groping Lord are trivial misdemeanors of the mildest sort. All any of the so called ‘victims’ need have done was to tell their ‘tormentors’ to p|ss off, and they would have gone away shamefaced. That should have been the end of it and it would have been if we were not part of a world that is losing its senses.” News flash – most gropers DON’T go away shamefaced – they love it if you are upset and embarrassed, and often if you freeze in fear they just carry on, or it escalates even if you tell them to pissoff. They follow you too. Please wake up. "
"I worked as a waitress as a summer job during university. At my interview, the female cafe manager asked ‘Are you a virgin? I need to know these things.’ I was also frequently groped by one of the waiters, as were other girls who worked there, including his girlfriend. When I complained nothing was done, and in the end I was asked to apologise for being frosty toward him. "
"Our company got a new EVP of sales last year. In our team’s first “meet and greet” with him, he referred to our company’s top two sales people (both women) as “princesses.” We all kind of looked at each other, and I guess he noticed because he then said, “Oh you know what I meant. I have two daughters, and they’re both princesses too.” Good news is he was fired not long after, though I’m not sure what the official reason was. "
"I work as a personal shopper for a grocery delivery app partnered with Whole Foods Market located in Brooklyn, NY. I interact with the product restocker employees there on a daily basis as my job requires when I need a particular item for an online customer. I had been receiving unwanted attention from a few male employees but one that stood out was this man who had an insistent but joking tone that I find the two of us an apartment to live in together. He had asked me this request a few times until he felt comfortable enough to inquire whether my pubic hair matched my blonde head hair. This man was easily 20 years older but I brushed it off as simple curiosity because I wanted so badly to shield myself emotionally. It wasn’t until I told my boss about what happened that I realized that this man was escalating his behavior and that something should be done. My amazing boss recognized the inappropriate behavior and explained to me that he would speak to the Whole Foods managers about this employee so that I wouldn’t have to deal with it myself. As amazing as his response was I still began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and shame for trying to protect myself. I explained to myself that it was the right thing to do and I found out later that they had spoken to him and they described him to look guilty despite his denial of the circumstances. He immediately stopped speaking to me and avoided me at all costs. My boss explained that he is now more afraid of you than you are of him. Realizing this makes it a little bit easier when I face others like him now. "
"I had just started a new desk job where I’d been set up with a computer and a login account. It turned out there was something complicated wrong with the account, so two men from IT eventually were at my station working on it. As this was a new job, I was dressed very well and wearing makeup while I got to meet all my new co-workers in the first weeks (first impressions and all that). While one guy was working on the problem, the other who was watching started teasing the working guy about “being distracted” from fixing the problem by my looks. I laughed at his joking out of surprise and discomfort. But I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to piss off the IT guy. Instead I went for a walk. It’s been a couple of years and I still avoid that particular guy. "
One time when I was at work a male co-worker came up to me and told me that he watches my boyfriend and I have sex while he jacks off in my shower. I laughed it off because I had no idea what to say to that and then I asked some other girls at work if they were having problems with this male co-worker and I found three other women who had been harassed by him too. I took this problem to my supervisor and he was fired immediately. 
"I have many, many stories (including the one I previously submitted about the bellhop in Argentina), but will only tell a few. In Germany, a man comes to interview and make a job bid to me, but starts talking with a colleague (male) who has no idea about this project. My colleague even tells the man he should be talking with me, but this comment is ignored. The two start talking and neither one was correct with the technical information, nor did either one give me the chance to even speak (they kept talking over me). After about 10 – 15 minutes of me trying to say something (to at least correct the basis for which this project should be done), I had enough of my time wasted listening to these two incorrectly planning my project, so I loudly interrupted and started to say, “The technical basis for which you are planning this is not X as you are stating, but as a matter of fact is…”, but before I could finish the sentence, the man (the one who would have been hired by me!) says this: “SShhhhhhhhhh!!!! The men are talking!”. Germany, contrary to the common stereo-type that I hear from many Americans, is extremely sexist. If you want to feel like you are stupid, weak, and no more advanced than a child, then Germany is the place for you! These are the “light” stories: As a woman, if you change a schedule due to an overseas trip, the men always respond with: “Where are you going on vacation?” (or something about it being a vacation). However, if a man says the exact same thing about not being available due to an overseas trip, the response is always, “You must be a very important at your company”, or “What kind of business trip is it?”. (I am directly quoting, and I have heard this countless of times! My husband has noticed it, too, so imagine how much these comments happen for a man to get annoyed by it!) I have been pushed and almost knocked over numerous times by men who donÂ´t say one word to me but try to shove me out of the way because they want to help my husband carry “man-ly” things, as they tell him that he “has no one to help him” (mind you, this is said as I am carrying the other end of some object without any issue). Even when my husband responds with, “No thank you, my wife is usually stronger than most men”, the German men smile like he is joking and continue to go on how “sad it is” that my husband is “all alone”. The times that I answer first and say we need no help, the men ignore me and continue to push at me to get me out of the way, and only stop once my husband says that he needs no help. If I were not so strong, I would have been pushed over a few times if it were not for me pushing back. Strange behavior, isnÂ´t it! A woman who is not so strong would be knocked over by men wanting to help the husband! In parking lots, as I pull the car key out and start getting into the driverÂ´s side of the car, and my husband into the passenger side, men standing nearby have started talking to him about “his” car. I have been asked what I thought when I saw “for the first time” the house my “husband bought for” me (people actually think the husband would go buy a house and that the wife would have no say in the matter, and not even see it beforehand!) When looking at real estate (100+ houses), we were always treated as my husband was the important one who they had to make the sale to, and I was only the tag-along they should ask if I like the kitchen (which, actually, is the complete opposite of our true roles). His titled name (i.e. Mr. X) was used about twice per sentence (which, actually, happens frequently in other situations as well), while I was only occasional referred to as, “You” (and my name is easy). We once even had an estate agent (a woman, funny enough) who somehow always managed to keep my husband going first into rooms to look at the house, and then she would block me from walking into the room. She would then precede to fawn all over him, “Mr X – what do you think?”, etc.. I did not exist in her mind in this buying decision. After about 5 times where I politely said, “Excuse me, I need to enter the room to also see it.”, she still kept managing to maneuver my husband first into ever room, followed by our structural engineer consultant, then she would stop in the doorway and keep her back to me and only move to let me into the room when I said something. Even when I got nails in my voice and told her, “Would you get out of my way, as I am the one who needs to see the house to decide if we buy it”, she still continued to ignore me. The house tour basically ended with me shoulder-shoving her so I could stay ahead of her. (I would have just ended the tour earlier, but it was the house we ended up buying). If I was some shy wall-flower, I could maybe (MAYBE) see some reason why she would “forget” about me, but that is not the case. (In Germany) I take my dog to a new vet. I register my name and fill out the dogÂ´s “passport” info., etc (with ownerÂ´s data, etc.) and give her the dogÂ´s old document book to make the new changes of address, vaccinations, etc. I sit down to wait. Later I hear the name called, “Mrs X”. I continue to sit, as it is not my name. The vetÂ´s receptionist (a woman) calls this name again and looks at me. Surprised, I ask her if she meant me. She was totally annoyed why I didnÂ´t jump up when she called my husbandÂ´s name (which is also a common one). So, I ask her how she even got his name as I registered with my name (and my dogÂ´s old passport was also in my name). Turns out, she looked up my telephone number in the phone directory, sees that there are two people with two names living under that number, and so switched all my information over to the manÂ´s name (my husband). She didnÂ´t even ask who that man was to me; for all she knew, we could be strangers renting a house and sharing a telephone number for cost reasons! Even more annoying, she re-issued my dogÂ´s passport saying he belonged to my husband – not even in both of our names! She couldnÂ´t understand why I told her to switch all the info. back to how I registered it, nor how offensive it is that she would look up my telephone number and assume that such a big dog must belong to a man. She refused to re-issue the dog passport, and every time I went back to that vet and told them my name is “Ms Y”, I would still get called “Mrs X” (even with different employees). At other vet offices, I found they crossed out my name in the dogÂ´s passport and wrote in my husbandÂ´s. In Italy, the hotel registry HAS to be in the manÂ´s name (if there is a man traveling with you – married or not). As you have to show your passports when you check into a hotel, they always get the manÂ´s name and the next thing you know, everything is in his name. You spend weeks planning out a nice vacation in Italy and book all the hotels (in your name) – Get ready to go up to your hotel room and see on the TV a nice welcome. But the message doesnÂ´t welcome you, the “lowly” woman! Nope. You will feel very appreciated for booking that hotel when you see the message, “Welcome Mr. John Smith!”. And then the rest of your time at the hotel you get called the wrong name, because he is a man and you are a woman. They wonÂ´t even switch the name on the registry if you insist, because…”The man is the head of the house”, to which I have a good laugh and tell them they may like to think that in Italy, but that is far from the truth (that response always quiets them. I guess they donÂ´t get that answer very much). So when I check out, I insist that they switch everything back to my name on the invoice. I always point out to them, if they are going to be rude and offensive towards the women who book the hotel in the first place, shouldnÂ´t they at least ask before the go and switch the name on the invoice, due to business expense issues? In South America, when we arrived at our hotel on the special shuttle bus, the hotel employee ran on and said to my husband (who was behind me as we walked down the aisle of the bus), “Oh, Mr. X! Let me get your luggage!”. This is fine, but it was strange as I also was carrying luggage and was first. My husband replied that he didnÂ´t need any help with his luggage, but the hotel employee reached around me and grabbed my husbandÂ´s luggage (against his protests and his comment to take my luggage instead) and lifted it around and over me. As it was large luggage, and we are all standing in the aisle of a small bus, I obviously got hit in the head and shoulders and knocked half-way over from the guy dragging the luggage over me (even as I was saying, “Hey! Watch out!”)! He didnÂ´t say sorry or anything to me. Actually, he seemed more annoyed that I was in-between him and the precious Mr.! This is a 5-Star hotel, by the way, so they should know about service. At least a little bit of respect! Again, makes me wonder why I booked that hotel; my husband would have booked another. In the USA, I was working on my engine of my car which had broken down along the side of a quiet and safe road. A man pulls up and asks if I need help. I told him “no” and that I knew what the problem was and that I knew how to fix it. He still parked his car and came up to “help” me. I again repeated that I didnÂ´t need help, and clearly told him the technical problem. He still pushed me out of the way and starts looking at my engine. Without resorting to pushing him back, I kept telling him what the problem was, which he seemed to ignore. He finally states, like he conquered the world for me, the general problem. I responded with the specific and technical problem, and how that was what I told him 10 minutes ago, when I also told him how I was fixing it. To give him credit, he then did look totally embarrassed, apologized, and said, “Sorry I got in your way and made you late. You clearly know more about cars and mechanics than me.” I have been called a slut for politely refusing to dance with a guys in bars and clubs, even giving the nice rejection of “my friend and I are having a conversation” (and it is clear my friend and I are deep in conversation and not out to party). (The slut comment coming from these guys is an easy laugh-off because clearly they have issues, but still it is annoying). I have been pulled over by the police and had the officer talk to the passenger (male) because, until I asked him why he is talking with the passenger, assumed that “because it is an expensive car, the man must own it and is letting you drive it”. I have heard a man (I believe Swiss or German) tell a table of about 6 other (American) men at a business dinner: “Where is John?” “Oh, his wife is having a baby? Then letÂ´s hope it is a boy and not a girl, because a girl is a total waste and is useless.” As the American men all froze (not wanting to disagree with their invited guest of honor), the guest continues on to “make his point” (as he noticed the Americans said nothing and all looked uncomfortable): “Tell me of one woman who has accomplished anything important in the history of the world?” “You will not be able to think of any woman, because no woman has done anything important”. These words still ring in my ears 20+ years later. Sadly, I have many more stories, which I will not tell. Luckily I was raised to be independent, happy, laugh at the foolish things that happen in life, and to ignore the idiots in the world – but sometimes I do have the urge to whack some people across the head!

"My first job was working at a greenhouse in middle school and high school. One of the cashiers called over the radio for someone to help a customer load several bags of soil and bales of straw into his truck. I ran out to the parking lot, waved the customer down and pointed to where he should back his truck up. After meeting him over there, he stepped out of his truck, looked me up and down and said â€œDon’t you have any men working here? Iâ€™d rather not have a girl help me with this.” I was so furious and shocked that I just walked back inside and left him out there to deal with it himself. "
"I am a librarian. Recently, a library patron I know by sight as he comes in often, out of the blue and uninvited passed some comment to me about the way I took my jacket off in town the previous day “like it was a strip tease”. And then he told me that someone had left a g-string in the men’s toilet in the next town. I was taken aback, and had no ready response. I simply looked at him. He left and returned, eventually to say ” I shouldn’t have said that should I?” I told him no. "
"I am a structural engineer and I began working at a new company last summer. On my first day the administrative assistant was giving me a tour of the office and being friendly. She was asking questions about me; standard getting to know you stuff like where I went school and if I have siblings. Then she asked if I had a boyfriend (after pointedly looking at my ring finger). I informed her that I was not currently dating anyone and her response was, “That’s okay sweetie, you’ll find someone eventually.” I never indicated that I was looking for a partner and my life is not defined by my relationships with men, so I was mildly insulted by her comment but I am used to these sort of comments and didn’t think much more of it. It was a comment she said a few days later that actually made me angry. Several coworkers were gathered in the kitchen area in the office one morning, making small talk. A male coworker who had started at the company a few months before me mentions something about his girlfriend, who lives out of state. The administrative assistant turns to him and says, “I didn’t know you were dating, tell me more about her!” and they began discussing his relationship. He had been working there for months and she had never thought to ask him if he was seeing anyone but I was asked within an hour of meeting her. Why are women defined by their personal relationships with men but men aren’t defined by personal relationships at all? Why is is seen as unusual or sad when a young woman is not in a relationship but no one bats an eye when a young man is in the same position? "
I work as a lawyer. In a recent performance review I was told I should wear more make up as it is important I make the most of my appearance. I am too scared to make a fuss as I love my job and don’t want to loose it. 
The founder of the company I work for told a small team of women that women have the potential to be greater leaders than men. They just had to avoid being bitchy. He even repeated himself when no one reacted. 
"At my first job interview, right out of college (and job training), I was asked I’m married. This is a normal enough question in my country, and both men and women mention their marital status upfront in their resumes. I said I wasn’t. Then it got a little over-the-line sexist. I was asked if I had plans to get married soon! I said “No….”, with a confused and a what-do-you-mean tone to it. They had the audacity to say that they were looking for a long term commitment to the project, and had to be sure I’d stick around. Since women usually stop working or move to another city after getting married! I was rudely shocked but couldn’t make much noise about it since it was my first interview, and interviews have a way of subduing fresh college graduates. I did have enough presence of mind to say “But its the same as the risk of losing people to other companies”. Fortunately for me, they did not pursue the topic and went on to discuss other things (which were also sub-standard for other reasons). I’m glad I didn’t take that job! "
"Medicine is quite behind the times. One glaring g example of sexism was when I was operating on a woman with a family history of a life threatening anesthesia reaction and needed to minimize the amount of time that she was ‘under’. My work partner, a male OB/GYN, was assisting me for the surgery. Throughout the entire surgery while asking for equipment from the scrub tech, she would not immediately give me the instruments and would defer to my male assistant to see what he wanted despite the fact that I was the primary surgeon and he was simply my assistant who had to be told what to do! It was infuriating. I had to remind the scrub tech 3 different times that she needed to listen to me and be prompt in doing her job–handing me instruments. "

"I joined a city committee, bright eyed and bushy tailed and eager to be involved in the community I had just bought a house in. The committee was largely made up of men, mostly middle-aged and above, so the fact that I am 30 and female was perhaps more of a novelty than I thought. At the end of the meeting, I was chatting with one of the leaders, a city official, male in his early 40s, about the committee’s project, which led naturally into a discussion about how I came from Maine originally. It was a perfectly normal conversation that any two committee members would have. When it concluded, as I was walking out to head home, I heard him say “You’re too good looking to be a Maine girl.” Just like that, all of the positive energy that I had from the meeting vanished, and I felt immediately powerless and, frankly, disturbed. This was an official city meeting, not a bar, and not at all where I would expect such blatant sexism. "
"First of all, look out for those inherently/ subconsciously sexist people, who proclaim vigorously that rape culture does not exist, despite there being an environment where women are objectified and have their traumatic experiences viewed with indifference. Secondly, don’t worry; sexists will be punished due to karma under God, no matter what the Bible states. God is fair toward everyone and there will be justice. Moreover, always speak up whenever you receive any sort of sexist remark; don’t let it normalize any further, and please try to re-educate those who are sexist. "
Coworker answered the phone and I heard him say “let me get My Office Girl” (meaning me). I responded; “My title is Environmental Protection Admin. Unless you would like ME to start calling YOU “My Dozer Boy” (He’s a heavy equipment operator). He blushed and walked away. Let’s break down his title for me: “My” – illustrates he believes I have been assigned to him to use me as he sees fit. “Office” – ignores my multitude of other critical environmental duties. “Girl” – illustrates he sees me as a child needing guidance which he is quick to provide. No it’s not a slip he made. It is a sneak peak inside his mind and shows he believes me to be HIS to BELITTLE and GUIDE while I am in his presence. No it’s not micro-managing. It’s sexism. 
"I am a commercial diver and have been so for six years. I have had to deal with the guys calling me names like honey, sweetie, bitch or cunt. Most of the time, they are “joking” when they call me derogatory things and being “nice” when they call me by a pet name- no matter how many times I have told them to stop. One time, a man said he was going to tie me up and rape me. Then he said he would tie up and rape my girlfriend too because that’s how you torture a lesbian. I wouldn’t respond or acknowledge what he’d said so he slapped me. I told him not to slap me and he slapped me again. I didn’t report it because it’s a small company, a small community and the man is my uncle who later insisted he was “just joking.” I was put on a different dive crew by my company after this incident. The new crew was cool for awhile but I clashed too much with the guy on our crew who viewed himself as the crew leader. I was nice to him and I was firm when he said things that upset me, like “you’re legs are going to be too tired tonight to fuck your girlfriend.” One day, it got so bad that I filed a harassment report. The next day I couldn’t come into work because I was dealing with a family crisis. I gave my boss ample warning and called for a replacement for me on the dive crew for the next day. My boss said that I was fired and even though his supervisors laughed at this and said he had no authority to fire me, they would not reprimand him for firing me and for not taking my harassment report seriously. The next time I came to work, I had an accident. My air pressure dropped while I was diving and no one would respond to me for ten minutes. When I came up, the guy I filed the report against was standing on deck with the other guys who were all laughing. I reported this too. An investigator was finally hired by my company. She researched the entire thing and talked to all the guys. She gave her report to the company who told me that the entire thing was just an oral report and that I would have to take their word for it that the report found that everything I said was “unfounded.” They told me to let it go and I could keep my job so I called the investigator and told her what they said. She told me that she was sorry that she could not give me the details of the report, she said that since she was hired by the company she could not release that information. She told me though that everything I’d just said that the company told me was 100% untrue. I still work for this company and I stick it out because it is a well paying job that I have a lot of fun at. The guys don’t mess with me as much and never in any way they could get reported over so that’s been good. I have not been the same person since this happened. I have always struggled with my confidence and this has made it worse but I will get better and I do so everyday. The community I live in has not been supportive but they are coming around… I think everyone who knows me and gets to know me understands that I am not the crazy bitch the company tried to make me sound like. I wonder if people feel bad because they didn’t know what to do. The people I was accusing are well respected men in our community although after working with them for so long, I can’t understand why. "
"I got my first job in IT in the mid ’90s working a help desk while taking a break from university. I quickly found that I had a knack for IT, and became the lead technician on staff. An integral part of the work involved providing phone support for field technicians servicing our equipment. On more than one occasion male field technicians would flat out refuse to work with me because I am a woman. At the time I was very young and naive (not very woke) and so I could handle this with more humor than I would nowadays. What I did at the time was transfer them to the dimmest man on our staff, let them waste 60-90 minutes of their time, and then quickly help them when their call eventually made it’s way back to me. I wonder if any of them learned anything from the experience. "
I have to face casual sexism towards me in the workplace every day but yesterday evening was one of the most publicly humiliating incidents that has ever occurred. I was delivering an important presentation at an internationally renowned organisation and two male colleagues decided to talk throughout the presentation. I had to stop a number of times and ask them to be quiet. When this didn’t work I asked them to leave and they refused to do so. I couldn’t concentrate when I was speaking and my delivery was seriously affected. I have not received an apology from them and I have reserved my right to complain about it. I am a professional woman with a PhD and was made to feel like someone who is not worth listening to or a cockroach that you step on. 
"My hairdresser went to a Physiotherapist for a back problem. She liked it so she went a second time, and this time at the end he asked her if she wanted a special relaxing chest and face massage (chest only above the breasts) but he had her take off her bra, got really close and had his face facing down towards her breasts and for 20 minutes when he said it would only be 5, breathing down her face and touching where he shouldn’t. A man and a woman she knows from the same workplace have also been to see this physio, and when the man went, the physio said something like “Wow your colleague sure has great boobs” "
"Sexism is even glorified by popular tv series. I love NCIS overall, but I can’t count how many times I’ve made the comment that things “tony” says to the women on the show would count as harassment. (Of course in real life “Gibbs” would never get away with head-slapping either.) But why is this even a part of this character? Why do we need to make misogynism and chauvinism so glorious just to catch ratings? And don’t get me started on the workplace….my boss thinks women should stay home and cook! "
"Business lecturer during uni class addressed 50+ students with the following comment about how women dress in the workplace: “If you dress like a whore, you’ll get treated like one” This along with on average 5 other sexist comments about women are made by this male lecturer each session.

"I work in a charity shop (same as a thrift shop I think) and one of the things we sell is books, which is fine because reading is good. The only problem is that we sort the books into male, female, and children. That in itself is strange but what really bothers me is that female books are romance novels (and tagged as such on the system) and male novels are everything else that isn’t a children’s book. Ots such a small thing but I can’t help feeling annoyed about it because I’m a female who doesn’t like romance. To make things worse, my supervisor (the one who calls them women’s and men’s books) is a female so if I said anything would think I was over reacting. Am I over reacting? "

"I worked at a small branch of a national (US) non-profit organization devoted to helping girls. Initially, my department relied on volunteers to provide some key services: videography, graphic design, and animation. My boss had specific things she wanted, and we discussed those with the volunteers, who all delivered exactly what they were asked — with no pay. Oh, and the three volunteers providing those services were all young adult early-career women donating professional services (two of the three were also women of color), so helping them to build their portfolios and network with our donors tied in perfectly with our mission. But then my boss left, and a new boss came in. She wasn’t a bad boss and she didn’t misunderstand the mission; in fact, she believed — or claimed to believe — passionately in the support of girls and women. Great! She was also quite effective at expanding our department’s budget, and wheedled enough money that we could actually PAY professionals to provide the kind of support we’d previously relied on volunteers for — namely, graphic design and videography. And to whom did we turn to provide those (paid, now) services? The same volunteers who had donated hours upon hours of their time to meet our needs? Did my (new) boss jump at the opportunity to pay them for their efforts… or did she instead hire white men with whom we had no previous relationship, and simply stop communicating with the talented young women who’d been willing to work with us for free? Yep. The second one. Ostensibly she didn’t like the work product of our female volunteers, but that work product was done according to specifications laid out by my former boss — for example, our videographer didn’t create a three-minute video because she couldn’t edit more concisely, as my new boss suggested; she gave us a three-minute video because that is exactly what my old boss had asked for. I argued the point repeatedly with my new boss, but she had zero interest in using — or even talking to or meeting with — any of these dedicated and highly qualified professional women, preferring instead to pay men she’d never worked with before. And it never occurred to her that this was sexist, or that this was directly contrary to the mission of an organization that purported to support women and girls. There were a lot of reasons why I quit, but that’s the one that still fills me with rage. "

"Last week, I had a meeting with a client and two of my colleagues. For the entirety of the meeting, I could feel one of the men on the client’s team staring directly at me. When I would turn to catch him staring at me, it was as if he had no shame and would continue to gaze at me. The following day, my male superior called me into his office. He asked me if I noticed the man staring at me. I said yes. He said it made him feel very uncomfortable and asked if it made me feel uncomfortable too. I said, to be frank, this isn’t the first time a man has stared at me and that I was used to it. My colleague then asked me if I wanted to be left out of future meetings because of this man. I responded saying that I have a great opportunity to grow and learn from this client and would still like to be included in all future meetings. I am most mad at the fact that I was going to be punished because this man couldn’t keep his eyes off of me. Why should I be removed from a learning experience because someone else wasn’t taught how to refrain from objectifying women in the workplace. If anyone should be removed from future meetings, it’s him. "

"In a pub last week. My partner orders our drinks (half a coke for me, half a lager for herself). Not only does the woman working behind the bar give her the coke and me the beer, she also feels the need to make a comment on the fact that I wasn’t the one paying. “Wait a minute, you’re paying AND ordering the drinks?! You need to find yourself a better man!” She says. The inference here being that no matter how much money is in her account, or how successful she is, or how independently she lives, she should always be on the lookout for a man who can take responsibility for her. Now, I know there are stories on here about serious sexual harassment and workplace bullying, and this story is in no way meant to be seen as equal in seriousness, but I can’t help feeling that small, frustrating things like this help to create a context within which more severe forms of it are easier overlooked. I didn’t realise getting the drinks in was ‘man’s work’. I’ll remember this rule for next time…… "
I was working at a high traffic McDonalds that was right off the interstate. It was my first job when I was 16 and I worked from when I got out of school until about 9 at night.

I didn’t know what to do so I nervously laughed and said “have a good night”. Needless to say I was a little nervous walking to my car alone in the dark when my shift ended.

"My mother, my twin sister, and I were subject to sexism while my mother was pregnant with us. It was the early 1970s, before ultrasound was available, and the doctors kept telling my mother she was “too fat” for being pregnant with one child. They did not know until we were born “how many” babies there were. Fastforward 13 years and I am in my 8th grade math class. Until this point, I had received top grades in math and science. One day, I asked a question in a math class to my older male instructor, who said “it’s ok if you don’t understand, girls aren’t supposed to be good at math anyway”. Another 15 years go by and I am the operations director of a homeless veterans organization. I was young and in a role of authority, kind of be default as I was the only one with a college degree, and I was given the nickname of “little general” because I was working hard to ensure we all worked in a safe and consistent workplace. I was later falsely accused of stealing $50,000 by a board member who felt I had too much power. Last year I was unexpectedly let go from my position for needing to work on my “soft skills”. All of these experiences happened in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, supposedly a very forward-thinking and progressive environment. I have also experienced hate crimes because of my race and ethnicity, also in the SF Bay Area. I have had multiple experiences of physical sexism in countries around the world. It was particularly difficult in Egypt where I was regularly grabbed regardless of my conservative dress and having my husband with me. When I had the opportunity, I asked a man in a marketplace why he thought I was having this problem, and he said “all white women have sex with men they do not know; it’s what we see in the movies”. I asked if it would be ok for the same to happen to their female family members and he was absolutely shocked at the idea. I had similar experiences in India as well. Whomever says things are better, is certainly not paying attention. Thank you for collecting these stories. I hope that it helps shed light on the issue and decreases the probability of it happening to the next generation of women. "

"Shortly after my 21st birthday I started working at a new restaurant as a waitress. I quickly made friends with the staff, and on occasion we would go out for drinks after work. I’ve never been a big drinker, and at the time I was struggling to find the point where “enough is enough.” One night after work I went out and met up with a few different people from my job and got drinks. I ordered a few, but my memory gets mighty fuzzy from there. I do not remember paying. I do not remember leaving. I do not remember getting into my coworkers car, and being taken to his apartment, and then being raped. yes. this. is. rape. unfortunately, I still have to convince myself that this wasn’t my fault, and that even though I had too much to drink, him finding it okay to have “sex” with me is still wrong. The worst of it all was I blamed myself from the get-go. No one came to my defense once word got out, except my mother, who quickly made me realize that yes, someone having sex with you while you are incoherent is, in fact, rape. When my co-workers found out the circumstance, they quickly came to his defense. “that’s not like him” “he wouldn’t do that” “you probably shouldn’t make a serious accusation like that” “don’t lie.” so I quit my job, and hated myself for a while. I still don’t openly speak on my situation, because I fear the response I’ll get and that it may be just as bad if not worse than the response I got when it first happened. I’m trying to teach myself that what I was wearing, or how much I had to drink don’t play a factor in the fact that I was completely taken advantage of. I now always have in the back of my head how I could be blamed if something of this caliber were to ever present itself again, and it scares me. "
"I’m 65 years old and the everyday sexism I’ve dealt with throughout my life is enough to fill a small library. Sadly, as we age it gets worse because you have the double whammy of dealing with sexism, and with age discrimination. I recently successfully sued my employer for both. First, for not paying me the same wages as the younger man who previously had the position, and secondly for failing to promote me in title and salary when transferred to a more demanding position, due to my age. Send emails to yourself documenting everything. Sexism is a form of assault and should be punished with fines, a criminal record, community service to women’s groups, and if necessary jail time. The only way to create change is for the sexism to have a backlash for those that perpetuate it. There has to be consequences for sexism, otherwise it only empowers those to repeat the harmful behavior. "
"Man on twitter only gets pleasant when woman agrees with his “what about the men” whinge. “Is EverydaySexism only a One Way Street? Men consistently stereotyped as stupid & inept in TV ads etc. women as competent and effective”. Why isn’t he asking why women are patronisingly portrayed as innately adept at housework and domestic goddesses? Why isn’t he asking why if women are seen as competent they aren’t repsected as such in the workplace? How is this perceived slight against him on a parr with the whole systemic abuse of women? One woman replies that her teenage daughters complain more about this “anti-men” type than than against women. “That’s good to hear! (I wish I could write this in a gurgly Soup Dragon voice)” It’s NOT actually good if they complain more about a minor complaint, than they complain about a major issue actually affecting the quality of women’s lives, prospects and safety. Maybe it’s because everywhere you look men’s entitlement is nurtured, so that when it is anything but directly pandering, it’s suddenly unusual and something to point out as ‘not right’. ALL forms of supposed sexism against men are side effects of SEXISM i.e AGAINST WOMEN. Men are dumb and can’t cook because ‘women belong in the kitchen’, to serve men. Men don’t have a clue about looking after their own kids because women are the expected primary caregivers and aren’t supposed to have their careers. It’s funny and slapstick when a man has his kit off because really we all know women don’t have desire, and women are the ones whose bodies are really there to be consumed,and traded between men like chattel. I could go on. "
"” 25 most gorgeous female politicians ” Oh right. Thanks, bet they are really flattered by that esp since you took a photo of one without her knowledge as she raised her arms to have a stretch, thus accidentally sticking her bust out. No mention of male equivalent. No mention of 25 smartest women. "
My male housemate at uni just tried to convince me that women should accept inequality in the workplace because it is too difficult (or too much effort) to accomodate female employees being able to work and have children. These kinds of male privileged attitudes still exist and maintain the pay gap. I hope when I graduate and look for a job the simple fact that I have a womb will not inhibit my chances of having a career. 
"New guy started at my mostly male workplace, and promptly tracked down the Facebook accounts of ‘all the fit birds’ in the office. He didn’t friend them on Facebook, and he’s never spoken to them in the office. He just looked at their Facebook photos. He (and my male coworkers) were surprised when I was horrified. "
"I am 17, I work part time in a kitchen and the chef continuously sexualises and objectifies me. I consider myself an openminded, bright determined individual yet he sees straight passed this and only focuses on my body. It’s constant remarks about my appearance, how he would ‘do me’, sexual innuendos, invading my personal space. He even has pictures of me saved on his phone and tells me he ‘likes to look at them?’ and then picks out particular ones and tells me that ‘he really likes this one’. It’s hard to convey through writing how objectified this man makes me feel, he is twice my age and is constantly looking me up and down and giving me ‘looks’. I value myself a lot more on my body and face and it’s such a shame that some men in this day and age refuse to see past that. "

At my workplace a young man had been constantly directing sexual comments toward a multitude of his young female co-workers. Anything from commenting on the way their butts look in their work pants to insinuating he would have sex with them if only they didn’t have boyfriends. The young women reported this sexual harassment to management in person and hoped that the situation would be remedied in some way. Just over two weeks later the young man became their supervisor. 
When complaining to a senior man in my workplace about the lack of communication shown by by male boss I was told to start drinking with him on Friday nights in the pub with his cronies or take up tennis! Likewise got nothing better to do than pander to this man! 
"I work at a restaurant as a hostess. This happened during a shift I had on the weekend. I was behind the host stand when two men were exiting the restaurant. After I wished them a good night, they proceeded to make a joke about wanting to take home crayons. We have crayons for kids to colour on their menus with. I joked back “If you really want to bring them home, we have boxes full of them so help yourself”. One of the men replied “Can I pick what I get to take home??”. “No.” I stated. I was noteably unimpressed by this. They just laughed. Just in case I didn’t understand, the man with him felt the need to inform me “He means that he would like to take you home”. They continued to laugh. I angrily replied “That is not a very funny joke to me”. They continued to laugh. I walked away. I am a teenager. They are easily my parent’s age or older. I am not comfortable bringing this up to my managers, but it happens all the time. I’m almost afraid that I would be reprimanded for standing up for myself. "
"I was at a meeting to be part of a fund-raising event for my local Labour party club tonight. I had been asked to volunteer to play the part of principal boy in a panto about social injustices. It would be a lot of rehearsal and time, but I thought I ought to do my bit for the socialist cause. Five others there, four men over 60, one over 50, and a woman over 60. The woman, who happens to be the chairperson of our local feminist group, announced that, seeing as I was pretty, I should take my clothes off during the panto, bit by bit, for the enjoyment of the audience. The rest of the group all sneered and gaffawed their approval, each making comments of the kind that they wouldn’t mind seeing that. I made no comment. The best I did was not laugh or join in. Later it was introduced that we would have to pay Â£10 to be in the play. I said I wouldn’t pay. I was told to have a bit of solidarity. At a previous meeting of the same group, the feminist was discussing a TV programme about a fictionalised rape case in court. She said that the girl was asking for it because she went back to the boy’s flat, that back in her day it was consent to go back to some one’s place, and the girl should have been greatful for a shag. She then went on to say she woudn’t have said no, and that she likes it rough. The leader of our local feminist group said this, about a rape, in front of me and a group of men. "
"My 86 year old coworker is quite literally used to a different time in the workplace…he’s been in this industry for over 50 years at this very company. Because of his age, he believes he can get away with making crude comments to all the younger girls at the office. My favorite example was when I was kneeling down to organize Fed Ex boxes and write up the shipping label and he called out “I love a woman on her knees”. Another good one is when you ask him “What’s Up?”…He then points downward towards his pants and says “Oh, you don’t even want to know”. This is usually followed by a smirk and a laugh. Age shouldn’t be a factor in getting away with things like this. It’s 2013, have some respect. "
"Working as a waitress in a tiny local restaurant back home. My boss (the owner) would FREQUENTLY make disgusting comments and behave in an innappropriate way. To name a few… 1) He bit my thigh while I was sat at the bar one day. 2) frequently told me or my friend that we smelled like “pussy juice” if we had seen our boyfriends earlier that day 3) He was a member of a site called “Benaughty.com”. He would call us over to see what we thought of the women on the site, only to be confronted with naked images of girls in sexual positions when he showed us his iPad screen. 4) would smack my ass at LEAST once every shift I wanted to leave that job so many times, but needed the money (it was Â£7 an hour) and was too scared to tell my parents about what was happening. Both me and my friend who worked there were 17. "

"I am an American, and have lived and worked in the Czech Republic for 8 months, teaching ESL at a local private high school and Spanish in a local language school. There is an Easter tradition here where boys go to girls asking for eggs, and the girls get swatted with willow switches. Most of the time it’s like a mix of trick-or-treating and a game of tag, and no one gets seriously hurt. However, when it happened as I was teaching, the male principal led the boys charging and whooping and hollering into the classrooms. Two boys would grab girls out of their chairs yelling while a third would whip them with willow sticks five or six times. The girls were screaming and crying, shouting stop, stop. Having already informed my boss that I would not be participating when he told me to prepare my backside for the tradition, I was backed against the wall. My male students and my boss came at me next with their switches and hit the backs of my legs with them, even when I was saying in Czech, “no, stop that,” and thrusting my knees at their balls. I was told, “calm down, it’s just a tradition.” They left and went to another classroom, and as I could hear the girls screaming from other rooms, the girls in my classroom were crying, and saying 5 or 6 times is way too much.” I heard the guys coming back, so I braced my back against the doors, and told my students, “I won’t let them get to you.” The guys rammed the door so that I fell away from it, and as I caught my balance I was face to face with my boss, his willow switch high in the air. I screamed at him in Czech, “NO! THAT’S ENOUGH!” He spoke to me like I was a student, “calm down, it’s just a tradition!” I screamed back, “I don’t care, THAT’S ENOUGH.” The guys moved off awkwardly as my students applauded. 25 minutes later, I went to the bathroom to check my still-smarting legs, and passed my boss. Again speaking to me like a student, he asked me, “did you calm down yet?” He apologized to my husband (not to me) when my husband called him to check him on his barbarism (my amazing and supportive husband’s words), but accepted no blame or fault, defending himself and his actions. He later complained to a male colleague that I had ruined his Easter celebration, and he would not give up this Czech tradition. The most supportive thing that I’ve heard is that yes it’s a horrible tradition, but it’s not going to change, and you will just have to figure out how to work with other people whose culture and traditions are different than yours (in other words, suck it up in the name of multiculturalism). As if I, who has lived all over the U.S., Spain, and the Czech Republic, speaks 4 languages and have traveled to 20 countries, needed a lesson in cultural sensitivity. Were it a slight against me alone, I would have already quit and reported him, but as it is, I don’t want to leave my students in this environment where no one fights for them. "
"The government has today announced the junior doctor contract it will be implementing despite significant concerns from any number of concerned parties. The full terms of the contract and the Equality review are startling – it explicitly states “While these changes may, in isolation, disadvantage women…Any indirect adverse effect on women is a proportionate means of a legitimate aim.” Women, the majority of junior doctors (around 60% of junior doctors are now female) are being sacrificed for the “greater good”.

"I’m a guy that used to be discriminated against in the workplace. I used to work as a secretary but because I was a male I used to be discriminated against when I was younger. Female recruiters would phone me to acknowledge receipt of my application, only to be surprised to hear that I was a male as they expected a female to work as a secretary. I would often times not get the job based on my gender. Thank God I changed on career into sales as I’m doing so well as Business Development Manager for a software company in Cape Town. "

Get married bitches. …….. really cant believe I am a professional woman reading the above in 2016. or did I just land in 1960 and need to find a deLorean to get me back to the dystopian future. "
"I was working in a job which loved and felt confident in, and was a well established part of my team. As my manager employed more people, mostly women, he started to become more inappropriate towards them. To the newer girls, he would pay nothing but sleazy comments, which was uneasy enough to see on a daily basis and was wrong by itself. To me however, he made comments because I wasn’t quite like the other girls. He told me that by wearing red lipstick and a low cut top on a team night out that I was ‘asking for it and if I said no a man wouldn’t take me seriously’. He told me that he doesn’t understand how I got a boyfriend because I wasn’t that feminine, he told me that instead of doing martial arts and watching rugby, I should be baking cupcakes and ironing to keep my man interested. That man made my life hell for over a year before I left the company. I never had the guts to stand up to him. Not long after I left the company I was out for a meal with some of my friends who still worked there. He decided to gate crash which was organised from a betrayal from a ‘friend’ who was out with us. I should have left, but I stood my ground and stayed. I ignored him and got on with my night. He proceed to them relentlessly call, text and leave voice mails calling me a coward. He wasn’t a kind man. "

"I have worked in my position as logistics manager for a major media, publishing and events company for 3 years. I would say that the workforce is predominantly female and having worked in largely male dominated environments before getting my job there I found it really refreshing to work alongside some truly inspiring female coworkers and managers. That being said the few men that do work there seem to hold the more senior roles and at one Christmas party the sales director (a man who directly manages over 60 people, mostly young women under the age of 25) turned to me and said “when you get bored of logistics, just let me know. I only hire good looking people and I’m sure I could make room for you”. This enraged me on so many levels! Firstly when working in telesales why on earth would you need to be good looking? Secondly I was shocked that in such a female heavy environment he still felt confident enough to say such a derogatory comment. Thirdly my actual position was more senior than that of a telesales rep, so why would I want to chuck that in to transfer to his team? Presumably his thinking is that women just want people to fawn over their looks rather than reward them for professional achievments. But the most unsettling thing of all was he thought he was paying me a complement. "
I think all women should care about sexism because we assume men should. There are plenty of females out there perfectly content to conform to the sexism and gender stereotyping so many women battle to put an end to everyday. 
"After returning back to work after taking customary maternity leave, a member of the Senior Leadership told me that having 1 child was manageable but that I should consider my career over if I were to have another child. This came from a woman with no children of her own. Doubtful that this same sentiment would have been expressed to a man, particularly since the majority of the Senior Leadership are men with multiple children. "
"In third grade, the teacher asked everyone what they wanted to be when they grow up. Everyone answered all the usual cute kid things, police officer, firefighter etc. When my turn came, I confidently declared that I wanted to be the first female president. The teacher, some lady, laughed in my face and told me to be more realistic. She said ‘ You could be a nurse or something.’ I said I’d like to maybe be a writer then. She told me to pick something less competitive. At home, I asked my parents for advice. My mom reassured me that I could be anything I want in this world if I just work hard at it. Later on, my now-ex-stepdad told me that women are only good three ways: in the kitchen, on their backs or dead. He said this was especially true for me, because I’m homely. I sank into a deep depression at 8 years old and started smoking. I rebelled, refused to be a ‘lady,’ and started my first job delivering papers at 12 years old. I worked hard in school for awhile then just kind of gave up during my sophomore and junior years of high school yet still managed to graduate on time. A decade later, after running an entire division of two different factories for four and two years respectively, sans any recognition or even a title upgrade, I can’t help but think that rotten b4st4rd was right, given the times, and that because I’m a woman, my work and my opinion will never count as much as if a man were to literally parrot my words moments after they leave my mouth. He will always get the credit, doesn’t matter whose idea it was. ‘Be more energetic and proactive, try to smile more and don’t look so stressed out’ they say. They tell me don’t be a victim. Its like being stuck in a perpetual nightmare where no matter how hard you work or what you contribute, you’re still less than simply because you happened to be born with the wrong bits. I will always fight this ridiculousness and all of the myriad perversions of it. We are ALL equal, and I still refuse to settle for less. "

"A female manager at my workplace resigned to stay at home with her daughter. She said “I don’t want my daughter to remember that I ever went out to work.” My colleagues were talking about her departure and what a good mother she was, and someone said something to the effect that women shouldn’t go out to work unless in a desperate financial situation. I said I hoped that through my example my two sons will develop a good work ethic and learn that they can’t always expect someone to be around for them. Multiple people then told me that I “shouldn’t be allowed” to have children, my sons would grow up to hate me, and I could easily afford to stay at home if I weren’t so selfish. "

He responded “woman, but you know what I meant.” I told him that we were both women and it was disrespectful for him to call us “girls” as he would feel inferior if we were to call him a “boy.” My friend and I then told him that there is still no amendment that states men and women are equal because it did not pass. He scoffed at us. "

"I am now 56 years and hoped sexism and equality for women had improved in the workplace – sadly no. I worked as a contract worker for a large engineering company in Warwickshire during the summer 2012. A manager who was a man contiually was verbally and sexually aggressive towards women staff, which i witnessed on many occassions, this was never challanged, the women involved were either frightened to speak up in fear of losing their job. However he spoke to me once and only once in this aggressive manner. Hasten to add I have now left this global company!!!. Although I needed to work i felt it important to stand up to him. Women cannot be spoken to or be harrassed in the workplace.. The incident was investigated and witnesses came forward and he was repremanded. However this manager is still in place as a manager, making very little difference to this engineering company, whereby they globally advertise more women now in engineering coming forward, I would not encorage my daughter who is in her early twenties. Sadly she has witnessed similar experinces – she wished to take a test to drive smale wal horse lorries she was advised not to take the test in Coventry, take elsewhere as the tester is sexist and fails woman drivers..! I have witnessed similar behaviour in my early twenties, and thought sexism in the workplace had improved sadly not in fact it is now pushed underground, which is more dangerous and serious!! Very sad, I feel so strongly that woman are now percieved far less stronger and articulate in this country. "
"Told by (male) recruitment consultant that I wasn’t a good fit for the agency or their clients, he said that few women do well in the financial services industry and suggested I consider HR since it’s geared towards women and is easier to fit around children.

"Hired as a physician working for a hospital system. Two years later, they hired a male doctor whom was not fellowhip trained, like myself. They hired him for $ 75,000 more than me. When I asked for more money, I was told that he was a more aggressive surgeon than me. They made this comment before he had started to work for them and without observing him. He was also put in an office with 5 staff members while I was kept in my office with 2 staff members. When I would ask for more help in the office, I was told I did not see as many patients in the office like he did. I kept arguing with them that I needed more help in the office before I could see more patients. "

The staff was told that it was not in their job description to be making me coffee. "
"During a late night shift – when I’m only one of two women left in my department – the acting head of that department (a man) waves around a pickle from a kebab he’s eating, saying: “Look at the size of it, it’s like a dildo.” I do not engage with this because I think it’s inappropriate for a workplace. But all the other men laugh their heads off, saying: “Don’t look [my name] don’t look.” When I stare at my screen and try to ignore what’s going on, the department head says from behind me: “Come on [my name] I know you want to look.” Later he’s talking about a man who slept with prostitutes and “gave them a good going over”. He says this phrase with such relish that I put my head in my hands for a second in exasperation – and suddenly he’s outraged. “Oh come on [my name], what’s your problem?” He said the phrase was a fair expression of what happened. I said: “I didn’t even say anything!” He replies: “Yeah, yeah, but you put your head in your hands.” It seems even silent protest is too much for his fragile ego. How dare I interrupt his late night boys’ club with a reaction of distaste. "
"If there is one feature of the Italian workplace that sums up the difficulties women can have while pursuing a career, it is the phenomenon of dimissioni in bianco, or blank resignations. For decades, many employers have insisted that new members of staff â€“ particularly female ones â€“ sign an undated resignation letter which can then be used further down the line to terminate their contract. In practice, say economists, it is usually pregnant women who bear the brunt and prosecutions are rare. In 2011, the Italian Institute for Statistics said it believed 800,000 women had at one point in their lives been forced to leave a job either during or after a pregnancy. “It’s astonishing,” said Daniela Del Boca, an economist at the University of Turin. “It’s totally illegal. But they can do it anyway, because you want the job.” "

Being told by my boss that the MD had a problem with my personal relationship with a man in our company and that this was a reason I was being held back from officially being given (and paid for) the role I’d been acting up in for more than a year. Apparently the MD didn’t like the other guy. I denied the relationship. I was so taken aback at the time. I wish I’d called this out as the appalling act of sexism it was. 
"I had just ordered fish and chips, served by a (very) young girl, and had moved along the customer “conveyor belt” to a server who would bag up my order. The customer in front of me, a man who appeared to be in his mid-twenties pushed back down the queue to tell the girl who served him that she had ‘beautiful eyes’, before returning to his position ahead of me to collect his order. Once he had his order he returned once more to start up a longer conversation. He starting dropping string chat up lines and answered each rejection to his advanced with a clumsy compliment before pressing the issue once again. The girl tried many polite rejections, before mentioning that she was of school age. Not even this stopped the advances. I’m embarrassed that I didn’t step in sooner, but I approached the serving area in that confused “hoping my presence will make the guy think about what he is doing and leave”. A couple of other customers made a similar pathetic shuffle into the area. I think we all suspected that this guy had been drinking and could become dangerous. Eventually, the man was talked away from the situation by someone who had come into the take away with him, and they both left. I’m disgusted by the behaviour of this man, and also embarrassed by my own lack of ideas about what to do in that situation. Ultimately, it is wrong that a girl can’t even turn up to do a job without being harassed. "
"Female colleague at work is talking to a male colleague. She has been there longer and is giving him a warning. Another (even newer) male staff member approaches, throws the dirty dish-cloth over her head and says “That’s how you get them to shut up”. I brought this up in a staff meeting as an example of the sexism that was going on in the workplace, and the boss’s main objection was that it made the dish towel unsanitary. This same staff member would ignore instructions I gave him on shifts, even when repeated six or seven times, until a male colleague asked him to do them. Otherwise, he would lie and claim to have done the action required. He ate my lunch on the grounds that he ‘didn’t agree with my definition of “my” sandwich’. He came up behind me when we all getting ready to leave after staying late. He walked directly up to me, stood very close behind and whispered in my ear ‘you ain’t got no secrets in those trousers, girl’. These were the same clothes that I had worn all day on shift, and no-one had had an issue with. This was clearly not a joke, as he said it so that none of the other staff could hear. Given that there was a guy who had just changed into cycling Lycra, I wasn’t even the one in the tightest clothing there. When I spoke to my manager about this, and the previous incidents, he promised to bring this up ‘urgently’ with the boss for disciplinary purposes. They didn’t manage to have a meeting the month I continued to work there. In the meantime, I couldn’t raise the issue with the guy myself, because I had been specifically instructed not to, and would have got in a lot of trouble if I had. "
"We really don’t need to look too far to see the sexism going on around us. It is so deeply ingrained in the society in which we live that it is part of our social hierarchy, part of our physical environment, and even part of our language. If we watch the films that are being spewed out by the minute, we will see hugely male dominated casts, with women there only when necessary, and women only being necessary when the men need someone to gawk at, laugh at, or sleep with. If we look around in the streets, we are surrounded by entirely male figures on our street signs, a ‘red man’ and a ‘green man’ letting us know when to cross the road, and men being the ones even taking up all positions on our ‘priority seat’ labels on buses, except, of course, when the reason for needing the priority seat has something to do with children. If we speak to the children in our classrooms, all the way up to students older than I am taking their A level exams, and we mention a character of unconfirmed gender in a position of power and authority, such as a doctor or Prime Minister, this character is assumed to be male, and a character described as kind, gentle and the like, who perhaps looks after children, is assumed to be female. If we look to the very language that we speak, even it is dominated by men, with phrases such as ‘fireman’ or ‘postman’ being used with ease, whilst speaking of a female in that role creates a difficult word to push off our tongues. We use ‘mankind’ as our go-to to describe our entire species, and our phrases and proverbs, from “teach a man to fish…” or “a fool and his money…”, all the way to the clichÃ©d television shocker “I killed a man” focus on men and men only, and are used in our everyday lives with no thought being given to the half of the population that they consistently ignore. The views that are created by the society we live in have so indoctrinated us that even us women are known to turn on each other, using insults like “sissy” or “you throw/run/scream like a girl” as the most hurtful thing to say to a man when we seek to insult. Women shame each other for being “sluts” or “whores” for sleeping around, whilst a man who does so is respected and admired. The word that simply means our struggle for equality – “feminism”- is a Bad Word amongst a huge proportion of the population, and those of us who still bear it proudly face criticism from people who don’t understand it for being misandrists or “Feminazis”. We are told so often to stop complaining and be happy with what we have that surely this, in itself, has become a new form of oppression, and one that easily allows our oppressors to label us as ‘stupid’, ’emotional’ or ‘spoilt’. The argument that we have already achieved equality in our society is the very thing that is holding us back, and if we are to move forwards, we must break down the assumptions and prejudices that maintain these so widely held ideas, and change not only the conscious views of the individuals around us, but the attitudes and beliefs that are contained within the very skeleton of the world in which we live.

"I moved to a country town not long ago and for the most part, find people here to be lovely and un-stereotypically open-minded. However at my work, even though the majority of staff are women, only 1 of the 5 people in charge is female. Speaking to a junior colleague recently I asked why she hadn’t been moved to her own office yet (as is standard) she said that a male colleague who started at a similar time would be moved first. Even though she works harder, longer hours and is much more competent. I asked why, and she said, “because he’s a boy, it happened with _____ too”. She shrugs this off like it’s nothing. Women in my workplace are lesser, jokes are made at our expense, we are “weak”, “sensitive”, easily overlooked. The few women who are able to succeed do so by being harsh, mean and cut-throat. The few times I’ve mentioned it to female colleagues I am told not to make such a fuss. I hate it. And I’m quitting as soon as I can. "

"â€œHey kiddo!â€? is a comment that Iâ€™m consistently met with at my current job. I’m currently stationed onboard a Navy ship and I am the only female in a leadership role within my Engineering Department. Before I start, you need a little bit of a backstory – I chose to work in Engineering because at my previous job, the Engineers were the roughest, toughest, coolest cats in the job. They inspired me! And I truly had the best mentors (male and female) in the Engineering Department. Fast forward to my current job… Since I have arrived, I have been met with sarcasm, with “pouty faces” when I tell people what to do and with comments such as “Ohh, she’s going to get mad and stomp her little foot!â€? My peers, all male and younger than I am (this is not an age thing) are listened to, are gravitated towards, and have never been met with the same comments that I deal with on a daily basis. I’ve struggled with both ignoring this, upon which seems to stop it but briefly, and saying something back of which the response becomes a variation of “Whoa – we were only playing, you can’t take a joke?” Any route I try to take with this is met with a nonchalant attitude that gets me absolutely nowhere. At one point, in the past few months, a female from a different department joined me in Engineering in order to work on a qualification. She was down there for two months, was dished the same comments and attitudes I was subjected to, to the point that my Departmental Boss heard about it. He then asked me what my thoughts were. I was frank and tried to let him know that the department is not a “bad” department, but the way women are treated in inconsistent with the standards that we put out in regards to our changing Navy. He didnâ€™t seem to want to face the music, so I asked him whether he thought I would be treated differently, better, and be more respected if I was a 6? tall male. His words “Speaking as your Departmental Boss, I would say no. Speaking as “INSERT HIS NAME”, I would say yes, you would be treated much differently. What can I say? This is a man’s world. Maybe someday it will change, but for now, this is how it is. Didn’t you know that coming into this department?” I was at a complete loss for words and at that moment, my big dreams of “women equality” were dashed against the sides of this big ole’ ship. To my Senior Leadership and my Executive Officer and Captain, I am an extremely competent individual with a stellar record. I’m competitive in my qualifications and am trusted with more than what my job calls for. I was recently chosen for a career changing opportunity at my next command so I know that I am doing something right, but I will say that this tour, originally thought to be hard but motivating has been disappointing, disheartening, and has brought me to (silent!) tears more than once. Ending on a better note â€“ I know that change takes time and weâ€™ve all seen how far weâ€™ve come since the days of being limited to specific jobs and only seen as fluffy headed ninnies, but there is so much further to go. So many more walls must be broken down if our children, nieces, sisters, and female counterparts are looked at for their brains instead of their beauty, for their strength instead of their frailty, and for the power that we bring to the table instead of the weaknesses that people mistakenly write into our sensitivity levels, soft-spoken natures, and calm demeanors.

"A guy I work with just left a meeting with me and another female colleague to take a call. As he left, he said, “I’m just in a meeting with the girls”. He’s 27 and a manager.

Also told I don’t say “thank you” often enough. I am rather soft-spoken, to the point of being meek, but apparently I’m still not deferential enough. Then I noticed how female managers (who are far and few between, I should note) express themselves. “I’m sure I’m wrong but…”, “What I am going to say is not the smartest…”.

"I am a 40 year old woman I am good locking I suppose but never thought I was anything extraordinary. I have two children. A few years a go I lost a lot of weight and my figure was perfect I was very happy about it and I felt really good happy that I succeeded in losing all the weight I had gained from my pregnancies. This is important because this are the reason I accused my self of taking sexual harassment. I started a new job and I was in a new environment after being in a very different working environment, I was very happy that I had found this opportunity because this was something I really wanted and I loved the job and I was doing very well at it. After one month at the job one of the bosses started approaching kept coming on my desk making comments on my cloths. Like this top you are wearing today makes us imagine things., that would be a Chinese closed top (not that it matter) and I would say but this a very conservative top he would say “well that’s the thing” he would do that almost everyday he would do it in front of everyone and I thought it was harmless and maybe he just found me good looking. He did ithis for a few months and then he started doing things like we would sit in a business lunch and he would sit next to me and say ” I wonder what this guy would do if you put your hand in his “thing” and laugh as he just said a joke. I always tried to show my discomfort, but it didn’t matter. Then he would go after me in the kitchen in the elevator. I had no idea what was happening. I had been married since I was 22 and with my husband since 18. I had no idea what to do. He was acting like he was crazy with me and when I pushed him away he would call me in his office for no reason and scary me like ” if I was doing something to him” I was going crazy I dint know what to do when I would not talk to him he would find ways to make me feel bad and scared or do things like he would put me down at work. I was being sexually harassed but I did know it I was furstrated I had two kids and a home to support. I was leaving work and I would cry in the car, I would blame my self what I was wearing, that I loughed at his jokes. He would come next to me in the kitchen in the elevator tying to touch me I would push him away but nothing mattered, because I didn’t know I was being hurashed. I had lost weight that was the problem I would say, this pans showed my figure I shouldn’t have put them on. He would say “I know you think of me when you get dressed in the morning” I didn’t know ! I was in physical pain actual physical pain, I couldn’t take care of my children I couldn’t focus I was scared. I gave in to him because I hoped the pain would stop. I pretended he was actually in love with and it was ok. I just wanted the pain to stop. He even said to me ” what you thought that now it would stop” he knew exactly what he was doing he was very well aware. After two Encounters things went a bit more relaxed he had weakened me so much that it was not challenging for him. What he wanted is the power when you don’t resist its easy, not that I say that’s the solution that was my weakness and a big mistake. After he continued he would still approach me in various way. You must understand that I was a strong professional woman. I fully realized I was being harassed when an other girl in the office left but before I had started opening up to her and she had gone through exactly the same with the same person and that was the reason she was leaving she said it was mental rape what she has been through. It’s like having to work with you rapist everyday and be polite to him. I tried every way every way there is, the only way I didn’t try was to face him to expose him because every time I would try to talk to him I would lose my words fear lived inside me. I want you all to know this there is no “I am making it an issue” there is no ” I got it the wrong way” there is ” I wore the wrong cloths” when your stomach tells you it’s wrong it is wrong, when you feel uncomfortable you should straight away say it. There is no probation period straight away you must react on the first comment. And there is no such thing as “my fault”. Today someone came close to me in the dinning area and he touched me just “you know the way that it’s not a touch but it is” that was while I had my back turned and washing a knife from my dinner set I immediately turned and said ” I don’t know where this knife will go” he got the point straight away he knew what he did he just though I would pretend it didn’t happen , and that’s what I would say before ” it didn’t mean it” when I knew he did. He was sitting at a table next to me and I with three other women and they show me and asked me what happened I turned and told them one by one what had happened straight away while he was looking..He was exposed ! They are weak if you face them they run like mice DONT GET SCARED NO MATTER HOW WEAK YOU FEEL! When it feels wrong it is wrong. Men stop next to me when I am in the car and beep and have even Tried to take pictures while I am driving I wouldn’t say anything up until now. This stops now ! Next time I will open the window and say I got your plate number and I will call the police. I have experienced so much harassment in the time I lost weight that in all my 40 years I could write pages this is just 10% and that’s because I am a woman . "
"I was sitting at my desk yesterday afternoon, when a senior manager came in to my office carrying a copy of The Sun. He proceeded to tell me that he wanted to show me a very short piece. The article was on page 2. Rather than cutting out the article, or photocopying it, or typing the text of it into an email, or even folding the paper over so only that page was visible, he spread the paper out onto my desk, so that page 3, with its attendant image of a topless teenager, was laid out across my desk. I am pretty sure he did this deliberately, but cannot of course prove that. I sent him an email to tell him what I thought of his action, to point out that it was in breach of our employer’s harassment policy, and to advise him to consider his actions more carefully in future. He replied, apologising, and later came to speak to me to reiterate his apology. When I tried to point out that such behaviour was generally considered to be unacceptable, and that the idea that such images were acceptable in the workplace had gone out in the 1970s, he walked off. Obviously a sincere and heartfelt apology then…. "

"At the age of four I was sexually abused. It was under the pretense of playing hide and seek, where a man and I were chosen to count. He asked me if I wanted to see his penis, which at four years old I knew was wrong, so I said no. He proceeded to get it out and tried pressuring me to touch it. I told his younger sister, who I felt I could trust, and she told me that I was a liar. At 19, I still haven’t told my parents, I am afraid that they will not believe me because it was so long ago, or because I was young so I might not have fully understood the situation, But I have never forgotten the panic and fear that I felt in that moment. I was thirteen and walking down the street with a friend in the summer when a car full of male passengers wound down the windows and screamed sexual comments such as “get your tits out”. No one had taught me how to respond to that situation other than to ignore it. I was fourteen and in a shopping centre when an older man asked me to meet him in the toilets for sex. When I pulled a face of disgust he said “you are ugly anyway slut”. At the legal drinking age of 18 when at a nightclub, I have learnt to not wear skirts or dresses. Men think it is okay to slide their hands up them and try to touch me. I have been told it is my fault for wearing exposing clothing. At 18, I wore a dress to work. My boss blatantly stared at my breasts, looked towards another worker, raised his eyebrows suggestively and exclaimed “nice”. This same boss found it appropriate to ask me every day how many times I had sex with my boyfriend the night before. "

I have to cope with being made to feel like the lesser in my own activity and encourages the parents (normally mothers) to speak to him when it’s obvious he has no idea how to do the homework whatsoever. I’ve had enough of it. I’m going to speak to my manager about this when he returns or someone. "

"Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, has launched a fierce attack on the gender stereotypes that hold back women at work at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Sandberg, who is publishing a book called Lean In on women in the workplace in March, singled out T-shirts sold in the US, with the boys’ version emblazoned with the words “Smart Like Daddy”, while the girls’ version says “Pretty like Mommy”. “I would love to say that was 1951, but it was last year,” she said. “As a woman becomes more successful, she is less liked, and as a man becomes more successful, he is more liked, and that starts with those T-shirts.” She blasted managers who unconsciously reflect stereotypes when they judge women’s performance, saying: “She’s great at her job but she’s just not as well liked by her peers,” or: “She’s a bit aggressive.” This happened to me yesterday. I took charge of a situation where someone was a bit clueless with the computer, calmly said what needed to be done, told them what to put and they typed in what I said. The person involved was happy with my intervention, no problems. To my amazement another party (who said nothing at the time) later called me a “bully”. I hate bullies and don’t have a bullying bone in my body. But women are still expected to be seen and not heard or to pussyfoot around with a soft voice and vague suggestions so it’s a shock to people, especially the older generation. Had I been male they wouldn’t have noticed I wasn’t playing the secretarial role. "

"The Topsy and Tim children stories CD has an episode on firefighters. At one point, they discuss whether women can do it. The answer given is, in substance “yes, but they must be as physically fit as the men”. Credit where it’s due: this makes the point that firefighting is a potential career for women. But there is an insidiously (albeit probably unintentionally) sexist message: that men are the point of reference. A woman applying to be a firefighter will have to prove something more than a man would, namely that she is as good as a man. Furthermore, a male firefighter is completely normal; a female firefighter not somuch. So a woman applying to be a firefighter would be trying to go out of the comfort zone of social norms. Not everyone is a born rebel, so this can deter women. A much better way of presenting this would have been to say that there are physical fitness requirements, which all applicants, regardless of gender (or indeed anything else), have to meet. The difference may sound subtle, but it matters. None of this affects me directly: I am unlikely to ever become a firefighter (or indeed a woman). But my 4 year old daughter has been listening to that story… "
"*So* fed up of working in a global organisation office culture where arrogance and bullying are perceived as ‘leadership’ qualities and the organisation pays lip service to diversity and equality then does nothing else to truly promote those concepts. Have tried to speak to managers and suggest improvements in workplace survey responses but challenging the status quo is vulnerable behaviour if you want to ‘get on’. One male manager physically recoiled when I mentioned sexism as a general concept. Coming to the conclusion that, in some workplaces, it’s not safe to highlight workplace issues or raise complaints unless you do it as a group or have active union representation. There is a BBC programme in the UK tonight called ‘No More Boys and Girls’ – the trailer suggests it will demonstrate how sexist attitudes are already pervasive in the classroom. Is macho office culture just the classroom ‘writ large’? "

He responded “woman, but you know what I meant.” I told him that we were both women and it was disrespectful for him to call us “girls” as he would feel inferior if we were to call him a “boy.” My friend and I then told him that there is still no amendment that states men and women are equal because it did not pass.

"“A prominent venture capitalist admitted to sexually harassing women in the tech industry, saying he leveraged his â€œposition of power in exchange for sexual gainâ€? in the latest discrimination and misconduct scandal to rock Silicon Valley. Justin Caldbeck announced on Friday that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from Binary Capital, the firm he co-founded, following the claims of six women who accused the 40-year-old of making unwanted advances, often in the context of potential business deals. Startup workers see sexual harassment on ‘breathtaking’ scale in Silicon Valley Read more â€œThe power dynamic that exists in venture capital is despicably unfair,â€? he said in his statement. â€œThe gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behavior played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment.â€? The lengthy apology from Caldbeck, who led investments in Grubhub and TaskRabbit, comes at a time of increasing backlash surrounding misogyny and toxic workplaces in tech. A major sexual harassment scandal at Uber contributed to the resignation this week of embattled CEO Travis Kalanick. The Caldbeck allegations have shone a harsh light on sexism in the male-dominated venture capital sector, where powerful executives can make or break startups and where women who face mistreatment lack formal recourses to raise concerns or file complaints. Tech news site the Information reported on Thursday that six women had accused Caldbeck of â€œunwanted and inappropriate advancesâ€?, with several saying the misconduct occurred when they sought funding or guidance while trying to start businesses. Two of the women decided to avoid business deals with him as a result of his behavior, the report said.” Fifteen years ago I suggested that IT had a sexism problem and was sneered at and talked over.

I recently deployed to an overseas location (my third deployment in five years) where a Department of Defense school (DoD) exists. Wanting to volunteer with the Girl Scouts, I had to report to the elementary school to fill out a background application. When I requested the form, a male in the office asked me if I was “tired of sitting at home all day.” I gave him a blank look, and he followed up with the suggestion to get a job and make a living instead of just volunteering. I was so shocked, I mumbled something about having a real job already and left. His assumption that a woman seeking volunteer service because they were “bored” is quite antiquated, and continues to grate on me. Not to mention, this male works with young ladies who do are exposed to this affirmation that women do not work. I wish I could say this was a single incident, but later, when turning in my form, the secretary (who happened to be a female) asked if I had signed up with the Red Cross yet – because this “volunteer service would look good on your resume.” I wish I had told her that my nursing license and Master’s degree probably held more weight for potential employers… "

"When I was about 11 my sister 10) and I went camping with our Aunts and family for whatever reason my parents did not come. We had an older cousin who was probably about 16. In the early hours of the morning I woke up to find him in our little tent. I think he had been drinking. He was lying next to me with trousers pulled down and sporting an erection. I was terrified, he grabbed my hand and told me to touch him. He put my hand on him. I just remember thinking that I had to get my sister the fuck out of there. I kicked him as hard as I could and ran away as fast as we could. We were terrified that he would follow us and when he didn’t we were scared of being in trouble for kicking him. There we were two little girls outside in the dark too scared to do anything but be scared and wait for the sun to come up. It did not occur to us to go to one of my aunt’s and tell them what happened to us. We never told anyone until we were in our twenties and we were swopping stories about ‘ fiddly cousin’s most girls have one or an equivalent! A few years after it happened my mom had a talk to me about a lecherous old uncle who would drive her to school and ‘fiddle’ with her and she never told but if anything like that ever happened to me I should tell her…. I opened my mouth and then found I couldn’t, I was worried about what the consequences within our family would be and nothing really happened… so… I only told her in my thirties. She gave me a safe space,I knew she would believe me but I still couldn’t! We managed to avoid that cousin apart from some incidents in the swimming pool where he would cop a feel even being brazen enough to touch a friend we had over! You learn to be wary and careful . This was in South Africa. I have just read your book and feel inspired and sick. Sick about where this is all headed and worried about my 3 boys and how it is imperative that they will not be like those boys who think it’s ok too say and do what they want to girls! I once overhead some pre adolescent boys in action. They were at a skate park and one boy went off to speak to girl he obviously quite liked… well the other boys couldn’t have it and started shouting to this girl that they could ‘smell’ her from here! These 12 year olds were telling a little girl they could smell her pussy! She was completely humiliated but tried to play it cool and they carried on and on. What kind of world do we live in when that is a funny joke? Because of course they were just joking! I wish I had read your book then because I would have said something to them. I feel like I am just waiting for an opportunity to call someone up on a sexist joke/remark or observation. Actually you start thinking back and the incidents are everywhere. That teacher at school who would fiddle with your bra strap while ‘helping’ you, the security man at my part time job in my teens who made me feel so uncomfortable for the things he said. The teenage boy who stuck his fingers in me when I we were at a big sleepover. The numerous men who would slow down and shout at while walking to school. Being flashed at more than twice.

A “good old boy” colleague who schmoozed his way to full Professor many years ago despite low research productivity insists on speaking to me in a condescending manner: sometimes (especially after I’ve challenged “good old boy” privilege-taking) he talks to me as if I were an ingenue who needs explanations of the way in which a department in which I have worked for over ten years is run; at other times he issues direct orders, as if he were a supervisor (which he is not) and I were his subordinate (which I am not); when he is asked to negotiate with me as an equal over an issue of shared concern, he insists on making the decision and delivering it to me in writing. Sadly, this behavioral pattern is common at my institution (once, when I chaired a committee at the university-wide level, a colleague of equal rank tried to treat me like a secretary, and doubled down when I called him out on his conduct): and my university’s leadership wonders why there are so few female faculty, let alone full Professors!

"I studied in a male dominated field (computer science). In my program, there was an average of 25% women. When i had my last exam after 3 years of hard work, i was so proud and excited, i joined the group because i thought we we’re going to celebrate. Wrong, THEY were going to celebrate, by getting lap dances at the strp club and myself and the other female of the group were not invited. So the group of guys i had done assignments and team work with for 3 years, all this time i thought were my buddies. I was wrong, they didnt give a shit about me or other females. That day i understood something about what the workplace was going to be like. Ten years later, i still work in a male dominated organization and do encounter sexism on a regular basis in the workplace. "
"I project managed a highly successful ,high profile , project at a late stage in my career, I am very experienced, for a man who reneged on all his promises to lead the project, I was left ‘holding the baby’, pulling all the stops out with my own skills and contacts and ultimately risking my own reputation to deliver it.At the showcase project event I heard him take the all the credit among the powerful, he offered no word of congratulations to me and undermined all efforts by other people to give me due credit. All the key project people were given a present at the showcase event and when I asked about mine he told me he had ‘eaten it. ‘ He went on to win plaudits for ‘HIS’ project and rapidly marginalised and excluded me when the project infrastructure I had built when it was was due to be repeated. he then made an office change whereby my only option was to work from home, excluding me from building on my success and claiming support from my own networks. The other key woman who built the project’s success was made to ‘wash up ‘on the night of the showcase event ,HE it was imperative as he claimed he was short-staffed for the project dinner. He held a meeting for people in the UK who had done similar projects and entertained them all separately afterwards without inviting me. He isolated me fromAmy possible routes to success by giving out misinformation to those on the Management Committee related to the project.. I wrote to the Chair for ‘advice’ who did not reply, the ‘Boys Club ‘Closed ranks. The upside is that a powerful man of integrity who worked on the project supported me by offering me a really good opportunity and I took it and loved it. I still look at the old project’s success and feel my name should be on it. I had to walk away and in the walking left good friends and good experiences. "

"My boyfriend sending me a meme of a bottle of chloroform with the caption ‘the only love potion that works’. I then naturally kicked off about the damage that these ‘jokes’ do, that they condone the rape & victimization of women and trivialise what is a hideous crimr. I’m so disappointed in him. Who else has he circulated it to? He can’t understand why I don’t find it funny, but I wonder….has he ever felt hungry sexually threatening eyes on him when he’s walked into a bar alone, has he been called ‘a fucking homo’ when he’s declined a woman’s advances, has he been felt up on public transport? Has he been spoken over at work, and made to feel his opinion doesn’t count? Is he told to go and make tea for everyone when there is a meeting? I will tell you this (I do try and be a one woman crusade) once I was in a crowded bar, waiting to be served. A group of men were behind me and kept touching my bum and when I turned round they all laughed. It kept happening so I grabbed the hand when it happened again, spun round and slapped this guy in the face. At this point, the bouncer came over and threw them all out. Now, I hope that might make those guys think twice about doing that again…but sadly, I doubt it. We have to speak up for ourselves when these things happen, believe me there are plenty of situations I’ve been in when I’m so shocked at what has just happened, ive been struck dumb. Keep fighting the fight, ladies. I have a son of 7, who already is telling me that girls are rubbish at sport etc etc. I always challenge him on these things and in the not too distant future I will be sitting him down and having to explain the dangers of internet porn.

"My workplace is a mobile van and so I often have to lift stair railings, wind wheel stabilisers and generally lift things to set up along with other members of my team. Every singly shift I have worked in my two years there, at least one (often more) male member of the public has stepped in and taken things out of my hands to lift for me. When I have politely declined their offer for help (as I am more than capable of carrying these items and well, it’s my job), the majority have become indignant and claimed “I was only trying to help” or “I was just being a gentleman”. It is extremely disempowering for people to assume that I am unable to do my job based on my gender. "
"Today I was on a course. It has been brilliant. Great course leaders & participants whose company I really enjoy. We are mixed in ages, nationality & sex, a very diverse group. Towards the end of the two hour session the male course leader talked about a forthcoming volunteering opportunity where we could learn more & put our new skills into practice. Great I thought, I’ll definitely put my hand up for this. But he ended by saying it was only for men & he had no qualms about advertising it to a mixed group as if it was normal. I was really annoyed & wrote a complaint on the course assessment paperwork that I intend to follow up. Only one other person showed irritation. I was amazed. He couldn’t say this opportunity is only for white people, people would be rightly outraged but why did he think it acceptable to say this is only for men ? I don’t get it. Not having a penis makes me less able than my counterparts ? What rubbish. The volunteering is for a religious group, if that is their stance then the course leader should have said he will not pass the opportunity on rather than collude with them & feel it was still okay to share it with us.

Once it even went so far as to have to tell the man that I was married, because my (fake) relationship evidently didn’t matter until there was a ring on my finger. Obviously the only reason I could decline was because I was in a serious relationship…it wouldn’t have anything to do with the fact he was a random man I had never met who was at least 30 years my senior and approaching me in my place of work in a relentless manner. God forbid I decline of my own volition. "

This was not only in front of the girl’s mother but also in full view of a birthday party being held for another five-year-old girl. I looked at him, very shocked, and shook my head.

"As a hairstylist, you have to work nights and weekends in order to accommodate your working customers. I had a male client who was 25-30 years older than me insist on being my last client of the night. This would also mean that more often than not, I was the only person in the salon working so I would be alone with my client. He propositioned me several times and offered me $1000 if I would have sex with him. He was married and his children were my clients, too. He also knew I was a single mom and did not have a lot of money. When I finally had the courage to tell him I was uncomfortable with the things he said to me and I thought he should find someone new to cut his hair, he sent me a long text berating me, telling me how crazy I was, and that I didn’t know what I was talking about. I never actually accused him of doing anything and only said our last conversation made me uncomfortable. His children decided to get their hair cut by someone else in my salon and bad mouthed me so much I had to leave and go work at a different salon. Since I am an independent hairstylist I have no boss or management to protect me from clients like this. I no longer accept male clients because of the sexual harassment I have experienced by so many of them. "
"Cross posted from Reddit thread on accidentally viewing your boss’s penis, apparently it’s the new form of flashing “I had a supervisor at one of my old jobs told me to find a file on his computer in a particular folder. It was full of dick pics and photos of him masturbating. He stood behind my chair and watched as I opened each file in the folder, having to see twenty or so disgusting pictures until I finally located the file he wanted. I was only 18 and really liked the job, and ignorantly thought that if I said anything I would probably be the one who got fired. This supervisor was in his late 20’s, married, a father of four, and a youth group leader at his large, well known church. He had worked for the company for six years to my four months. It seemed like a sure bet that if I “caused trouble” I’d be the only one punished, so I just ignored the incident. He was only testing the waters with the dick pics. Over the next several months he started touching me anytime we were in the same room: picking invisible lint or hairs off my blouses, patting me on the butt, sticking his hand down his pants to “rearrange” himself, talking about what a large dick he had and how he thought I’d enjoy it if I touched it. If we passed each other in the hall he’d intentionally rub his body against me, and if we had to be in the darkroom together he’d pin me up against the table or shelves with his arms on either side of me to grind his erect penis on my ass. I became terrified to go to work and abruptly quit one day, without notice or explanation. Several months later I went back to return some things to my old boss and the awful ugly abusive guy wasn’t there. When I asked where he was the owner told me he’d been fired. Apparently he’d gone out of town to a church youth group conference and the owner had to go collect the business mail from the post office himself, which he never did as it was one of the abusive guy’s tasks. He found brown paper wrapped child pornography magazines addressed to the abuser at his company’s business address and fired him immediately. I broke down and confessed about the months of harassment I’d endured, and admitted that that was why I had quit with no notice. The owner was so horrified he almost wept and he apologized over and over again. He asked why I hadn’t trusted him enough to come to him with this, and I told him I just didn’t think a new employee would be believed over an older, more respected employee who was well known as Mr. Youth Group Leader. ” Call it out immediately . Flashing often escalates. I know they want a reaction but you still have to call it out, as calmly as you can. I got sent inappropriate material by an ex policeman and he really wanted a reaction, I honestly didn’t know what to do and was really intimidated, so I just ignored it and had no further contact with him, now I’m wiser to the world and would expose him, but we live and learn. Zero tolerance, they know exactly what they are doing, if it’s your boss you have to call it out as calmly as possible. "

"When I was 13, I was on the way home from school on the school bus sitting in the window seat when one of the 16 year old boys came and sat next to me, stroking my hair and whispering ‘penis’ and ‘you’re pretty’ at me. I was trapped in the seat as he was sitting in the aisle side, and he only stopped after repeated insistence from one of the senior girls that he leave me alone. I know it’s only little, but I was really upset and at the time couldn’t understand why it made me feel so ashamed and dirty. It was dealt with by the school. Also, I work at a bakery and one of the old customers was making odd comments, but I just kept telling myself I was reading it wrong and that I was just paranoid. He kept winking at me and when I turned around from the bread slicer he was making obscene gestures with his tongue. I was incredulous that he was doing this in broad daylight. It annoys me because I can’t remember what he looked like so every time an old man comes up to the counter I’m wary. Before this I always really liked my customers especially the regulars seeing as they’re usually so nice, but I do remember that the creepy old man is a regular, so I don’t know which customer is creepy and which isn’t. What, because I am a (19 yrs old) young female I deserve no respect, even in the workplace? "

"A few years ago I got my first job as a waitress in a cafe that my dad’s friend and his wife owned. The workers were really nice and fun to be around, at least for the first month. And I loved it there. But later, when I was part of the “qlique”, I started doubting them. That was when the harrasment started. I had seen them do it to each other in the fist month, never did they include me. It seemed like an inside joke and because some of them had been or were at the time in a relationship with eachother it did not seem as much. I was a virgin, never had I been intimate with someone. And then the “jokes” started. slapping my ass in front of the costumers, pinching my boobs, sex noises behinde the WC door, standing behind me with hands on my hips while I was pouring drinks, humping me from behinde as a surprise and the endless sex jokes and suggestions. I was scared to tell the owners that I was not comfortable with it because I was ashemed that my dad would find out. I was scared of slut shaming, tho I had done nothing wrong. I had asked the others to stop it, but got called chicken and told to loosen up. And as it was my first ever job, I didn’t want nor could I lose it. But I had this inside feeling, that if I did ask for it to stop and reported it, I would be sacked. "
"I went for drinks after work recently and ended up staying late with a colleague who I often have a last drink with. There’s nothing in it, he has a partner and child. He offered to take me home to make sure I got in safely and we decided to grab one more beer before his taxi home. I must have passed out because I woke up half naked and he was fully naked in my bed. He said I had kissed him back but I didn’t remember anything. I asked why the light was off and he said he asked me if I wanted it off and apparently I just mumbled that I didn’t care. I still don’t know what happened that night. He says we didn’t have sex but there was a condom in the floor before he left and it was gone when I eventually went to bed. He took it with him. I know I wasn’t conscious enough to consent to anything that night. I have a boyfriend. It’s possible that I thought I was with my boyfriend and kissed back. I definitely wouldn’t have fooled about with him. I don’t even fancy him. I can’t even report it because I don’t even know what happened myself. "

"Reading some of the comments by other women about awful treatment in the workplace my initial thought was how lucky I am: 18 years in engineering and I’ve never been groped, asked to make the tea, told to wear a pretty dress, mistaken for a secretary. Oh, but there was the small matter of the 8 of those 18 years I spent (and three years my more recently appointed female colleague spent) being paid Â£5k a year less than two men doing the exact same job as us. Repeatedly we were told there was no gender issue, it was all “historic” (we had different backgrounds in terms of qualifications and experience). It took a full year of dispute, despite having trade union reps AND our actual boss (male, decent but with no salary-setting powers, that comes from higher up) supporting us, and threats of a tribunal, before we got justice. Yet still I think I’ve had it so easy compared to many women. How wrong is that? "
"I wanted to say how much more confident I feel after reading these posts, even though (or maybe because of the fact that) some of them are harrowing. There are so many people who see sexism, overt or subtle, and do nothing- or worse, blame the victim. After a while I feel like it’s a hopeless battle, and to conserve my energy for daily tasks, I start letting things go and veer towards resignation to the idea that “this is just what happens”. I’m in my mid twenties now and I don’t actually receive as much sexual harassment compared to when I was in high school. It’s not entirely clear why that is. However, as I am starting my own business and doing a doctorate degree, I am feeling the full force of the intellectual underestimation that women tolerate. In these male-dominated and intellectually competitive fields, I am always fighting the presumption that I am not incompetent or a dilettante. Being an Asian woman who is small in stature, that underestimation is doubled. When I speak up in meetings I tend to get two reactions – over-the-top agreement from men who are trying to fight their own sexism, or hostility from people who feel threatened or confused that someone like me is trying to hold the floor. The men around me speak up with ease – no one interrupts them if they pause to gather their thoughts, and are generally allowed to hold forth on a topic while the women around them nod in agreement. The fact that women have bought up the sense of their inferiority is the aspect of sexism that depresses me above all else. They allow men to talk at them, dictate the conversation, go on and on about something they already know, or have no interest in. They encourage these men to do so because they don’t want to be seen as difficult and unlikable. Sadly, I used to be one of those women, and unlearning that habit is proving to be a daily battle. Please speak up in conversation, and insist on finishing your point when you are interrupted. The assumption that we are to take the role of a learner and listener in any conversation (especially with a man with one or two accomplishments under his belt) is widespread. It damages our self-esteem and makes us feel that we are only fit for supporting roles to ease the development of the male genius. Being perceived as ‘annoying’ or ‘talking too much’ as a woman is only relative to the ideal which has been imposed on us – that ideal is that of an agreeable listener. We need to be more assertive in discussion to undermine that ideal and we need to make it seem normal when we express our opinions freely. This is particularly crucial with Asian women. The racial element here is important – in my experience growing up as an immigrant in predominantly white schools and universities, I have met white women who dominate class discussion. Asian women however, tend to remain silent and listen. "

"I work in a field that is traditionally female dominated. This doesn’t mean that women working in the field don’t experience sexism from male colleagues, supervisors, or the populations we serve. I am a librarian. The public library I work in employees just more than 50 people. Of those, only 7 are men. Recently a male employee who was hired less than a year ago and with less than 2 years of professional librarian experience was promoted and appointed a Department Head. The promotion was done quietly, subverting the civil service system in place for hiring and promotions. No vacancy was announced for librarians to apply. Before the promotion was announced – around the time the director reports deciding on the move, this male employee and the library director had recently attended a library conference together, roomed together and hung out, drinking beers and watching baseball. Every female employee who might have been interested in the position has more experience than this male employee. This was so blatantly a sexist decision and those outraged by this are left with no recourse, no voice. Grievances levied by union reps made no mention of sexism, because there is no real way to PROVE this. I, and my female colleagues are left feeling devalued. What makes it feel even worse is that there are some women in the library who haven’t even considered the sexist overtones of this situation. "

After receiving it, he seemed to avoid me so I confronted him later in the day and said that I hoped it wasn’t weird or creepy – I just wanted to say thanks. He then proceeded to say that the card was really sweet and that I’m “so fucking beautiful” that he’s going to stay away from me for fear that he’ll fall in love with me. I am currently at my desk and utterly dumbfounded. How is that an acceptable response? And why is my alleged “beauty” a justification to stop talking to colleague? "

"It isn’t easy being in the army, but I think it’s even harder studying to be in the army- especially when you’re 5,4? and barely 18 like me. I knew that the field I am entering is male dominated so I assumed there would inevitably be some problems… But I had no idea. I told myself nothing would push me away, but sometimes I wish I could give up. The other week a sergeant told me that “girls like me should just stay in nursing schools.” I tried to overlook the disrespect to nurses and tell myself I was being the ‘killjoy’ and the ‘crazy feminazi’ like I feel everybody tells me I am, but it felt wrong. The sergeant followed up that somewhat vague insult by blatantly stating that ‘I would get raped and be left to die on deployment because my team would hope that it would shut me up, because I am a girl and I am only seen as a sexual object in this field.’ That wasn’t even the part that upset me the most. I was livid. I am livid. I immediately brought the issue up to my chief, but to my surprise he asked me ‘if I really wanted to make such a big deal out of it’ and told me that ‘I should just let it go’ and ‘not cry wolf’. You see, the sergeant was female- so there’s no way she could be a sexist and I was clearly overreacting- right? My officers seemed to think so. They (after telling me about all the problems this could cause for her) told me that they would look into my incident report if I really really wanted them to, and finally I dropped the issue. I was and am so upset. This kind of thing happens all the time here. Females experience harassment for being female and then are pressured to remain silent and ‘calm down’ as a response. We’re told we’re being emotional, but I don’t think anyone likes being underestimated and undermined. I felt so pressured to “keep the peace” and let the issue go in order to remain respected. I feel like there’s always a pressure on me to lie about what hurts me in order to not be seen as ‘crazy’ or, well, female. Men are taken seriously here- but we always have to calculate our actions. I cut my hair off. I told everyone it was just time for a change, but really I cut it off so that I could meet male dress standards. If I meet the female dress and deportment standards I feel like I’m not meeting any standard at all. I’m treated like I met the ‘bronze’ standard. It’s as if the best a girl like me can do pales in comparison to my male classmates. If you want to be taken seriously as a girl out here, the first thing you need to do is not be a girl…. Then find a way to deal with the judgment you’ll receive for not being ‘like a girl’. I don’t know what telling this story is supposed to achieve, but I guess I just wanted someone to hear my words. I feel like giving up. "

"I recently broke up with my long term partner. Having moved to my current city to be with him, I had a shocking moment of realisation that, apart from some (amazing) colleagues, I was very much alone in this city. I’d left behind my family and friendship circle and I realised that I missed them and I wanted them back. I also considered the fact that I’d been staying at my current school out of a fear of the unknown and if I stayed I was never going to teach A Level, which had always been a dream of mine. I made plans to leave. I was very open about this with my department so when the head discussed the possibility of my staying at the school another year with my head of department (not with me…) she too was open and explained my desire to be back in a place I loved and closer to family and friends following this break up, along with my desire to stretch myself professionally. The head responded: “We’ll just have to find her a boyfriend in (Current City) then.”. It may seem minor, especially given that I did move to be with my previous partner, but the implication that a man, any man, would be enough to make me re-evaluate what began as a personal decision but in turn became a professional one made me extremely angry. He since has made remarks about “going home for Mum’s cooking”, implying my desire to be near family is childish some how? Note: The same head, when discussing appropriate work wear in staff briefing, made reference to “the girls *ahhem* ladies” wearing blouses and skirts or dresses… his deputy had to jump in and say of course work trousers were permitted… "

Had comments such as ‘These are sports injuries, you wouldn’t understand being female’ and ‘You don’t have to worry about getting into surgery because you’ll just be off having babies’ and (my favourite so far) ‘Why are you trying to be a doctor instead of a nurse?’ What was particularly awful is that they found it hilarious, and clearly expected me to laugh along with them. I stuck it out, but one particularly bad day after a particularly snide comment, I de-scrubbed and walked straight out of the theatre without looking back. I heard ‘see, the girls just can’t handle it’ as I left. These are not just doctors, but my tutors, my advisors, people I am supposed to learn from and emulate in my future practice. My learning experience was significantly poorer than the male students and therefore my knowledge of important conditions and injuries is affected. In the world of medicine, where the majority of students are now female, how can this bullying, sexist behaviour still happen, to the detriment of teaching future generations? "
"Yesterday was International Women’s Day, and after college I had to work a late evening shift in my local store. I served a man who was a lot older, bigger and taller than me. This didn’t intimidate me but after he took my hand and told me he wanted a massage it did. All I did was laugh it off, I should’ve stuck up for myself. But sadly, when I told my colleagues (all women) none of them saw this as harassment – instead told me I should treasure it because ‘you don’t get that when you’re old.’ This isn’t the first time I’ve received unwanted attention. Along with wolf-whistles and honks of cars, one man shouted from his convertible ‘I want to lick your p**sy’. At the time I was 16. I felt so vulnerable, and not to sound rude and prejudice I was surprised that this had come from a single, 30-something man in what looked like to me to be an expensive car- not the usual huddle of young builders that everyone warns you about and that holler at school girls across the street. Then came my first job. As a waitress I worked long shifts with just the chef for company. He was 37, and I knew his father-in-law so we had something in common to talk about if we were stuck for conversation. But he never seemed to be, after a while he referred to me as his ‘work wife’ and talked about our wedding night and where we’d go on our honeymoon. He would insult my boyfriend, trying to himself appear ‘superior’ instead just looking like a pervert. I finally left the job after I couldn’t stand it anymore, he told me the women who worked on the bar had been b*tching about me and it was all because apparently they were jealous because (his words) ‘you have a sexy body and great t*ts’. I was horrified, I didn’t say anything and I think he realised he’d over stepped the mark. "
My male colleague has organised a football tournament at work to raise money for charity which he has sent invites to other men in the company. I asked whether he was going to ask women to play and his response was “no because they could get hurt”. I responded by saying that it wouldn’t hurt to ask as I’m sure that there would be some women who’d be interested in playing. I almost felt guilty asking this and pointing it out…it made me uncomfortable to think that women would be excluded from sport events but targeted for bake sales for charity. It shouldn’t happen. 
"Working as a language assistant at university, I was introduced to a class by a female teacher as a “younger and prettier version” of herself. What difference does my age make? What difference do my looks make? I felt very disappointed that these adjectives had to be chosen in front of a class of male students. "
Why is it expected that if a woman has kids she can’t work? Even women who work and have kids are expected to work around their children but the men are not. And why are all women supposed to want children or to change their name after getting married. If i ever have kids i will be working full time! At school a girl was sexually assaulted and some of the other girls said that she shouldn’t have been wearing a short skirt. I have been sexually assaulted many times and so have a lot of my friends. My school actually gave the girls an assembly in which they told us that wearing a short skirt means we don’t respect ourselves which is not true. People also see women who like sex as sluts but not men. Women are still shamed for having periods! 
"My daughter is currently doing a College placement at a care home. Today she had to give an elderly man his breakfast. While she was doing it he put his hand on her back and travelled it down and then squeezed her bum. At what point do creepy men stop being creeps (never!) and why did the Care Home let an 18-year-old into a room with a notorious groper? She assured me that I didn’t need to go and read the riot act but it just made me so cross! Unfortunately, told her that it probably wouldn’t be the last time. Sigh. "
"I remember at the first work christmas party, I was approached by a Senior Manager who asked why my partner wasn’t there. When I told him I was single, he told me I shouldn’t wait ‘too long’ as I won’t be young for long. I was then approached by a male colleague who told me that I looked ‘F&*(able’. Later on in the night my Manager told me that I looked nice and gave me a once over in front of other managers at the company. One of the managers then went on to recall a story of a young woman who worked on reception who was very attractive and distracted all the engineers, as though this was something I was also doing. "
"Boss called me into a meeting (no HR present) and explained that he had recently had to speak to someone about their inappropriate attire – too much cleavage. He then went on to explain that that experience had prompted him to preemptively talk to me about my prominent nipples. Apparently he thought that they were sending the wrong message. He proceeded to explain that I should wear the same padded bras as his well endowed wife. I thought long and hard about what to do as, though he was a moron, he was generally a somewhat clueless nice guy. I knew if I reported him he would be fired which was not the end result I wanted so I met with him again, explained that he broke policy and potentially worse with his conduct .He told me I didn’t know what I was talking about. Dumbass got himself fired a month later for being useless. "
"This is a brilliant idea. Over my career, I’ve experienced numerous examples of blatant, subtle and covert sexist techniques in the workplace. One of the issues is that people think sexism at work is another term for sexual harassment. A few examples: My current boss, who made a big deal of suddenly proclaiming that he ‘doesn’t hold’ with this gender-neutral language nonsense. (I had never raised this subject at anytime with him.) The guy last week who ‘apologised’ for calling me and a work colleague girls at a meeting, then poked my colleague in the arm and said ‘and that’s assault, isn’t it?’ before walking away laughing. An increasing number of instances where women at work are agreeing with male colleagues’ expressed chauvinist attitudes. Several times where a senior manager has made a show of having an event to talk about promoting women in the workplace (or some similar title), many women turn up as do a couple of guys and, somehow, these guys end up grabbing the attention and doing all the talking, which becomes about how men are discriminated against too. (This is true but the meetings are supposedto be about empowering women.). Also, at similar meetings, situations where the senior manager asks if anyone has experienced sexism at thos workplace? There is silence, followed by some half-hearted denials. (The workplace is too risky a place to publicly make statements of this nature. Surely the senior managers know this??) Many instances where a male supervisor has ‘taken a junior young man under their wing’ to ‘show them the ropes’, where there is no equivalent mentoring support system for the junior female staff. Many instances where men have assumed I know nothing about a subject (I am highly qualified and experienced in my field) and yet assume that an inexperienced junior male worker has more knowledge and experience than they do have. The time where a female work colleague confided that the only way to get ahead in the department was to leave. ‘Old-fashioned’ favouring of junior, more attractive female staff to the detriment of older, more experienced workers. (Unthinking assumptions that the younger female is more able, on the basis of her appearance.) Overt and covert sexism dynamics at meetings – men deliberately and blatantly ignoring then ‘parroting’ my ideas at a meeting where I’m the only female (when I object I’ve been told I’m imagining things or similar); the ‘eyelock’ technique, where comments are always directed at the male/s at the meeting, as though the women present were invisible; men talking over and interrupting me, then being reprimanded publicly for ‘ignoring’ their attempts to do this (being told I should have given way); ‘jokes’ and other remarks about feminists, ‘political correctness’ or similar, with the clear yet indirectly-expressed message that diversity and equality issues are a waste of time. There is a lot more – will post more if I remember. "
I’m am not 24 and up until a couple of years ago (in my current role) when the man retired every morning when I came into work he would say that he was better for seeing me and make me do a twirl (which I would do) and tell me what a nice body I had. It made me so uncomfortable and I had spoken to people about it who just said that it was just because of his age because in his day it wouldn’t have been a problem but to this day I don’t know what that means I had to put up with it 
"Sexually assaulted at age 15 by a stranger. Reported it to police. They asked me what I was wearing. They then told me that I look “too young and vulnerable” and need to try to walk in “a less feminine way”. Still trying to figure that one out. If I told anyone about the attack the first thing they would ask me was “what were you wearing?”. Would love to know what clothing would have “justified” the attack. Sexually assaulted at age 17 by a drunk boy at a party. Told one of my (female) teachers the next week at school. Was told “That’s just what boys do when they’re drunk”. Went for an interview and was accused of lying about my qualifications. Luckily, I had brought all of my certificates to prove that I hadn’t! Needless to say, I didn’t get the job. Was working on a difficult project at work. Was told to “flirt and use my feminine charms” to appease the situation (and the difficult men involved). Frequently hear women saying “I’m not a feminist” but then can’t define what a feminist is or why they are not one. Friend got stalked by a guy at work. It was getting a bit creepy so she reported it. She was told not to tell anyone as they didn’t want the man to feel embarrassed. Since when should we put the stalker’s feelings first? Started in a job as a service manager (a fairly senior role). When I went to a meeting I was greeted with “So you’re the new manager. We’ve been told to look out for someone, young, blonde and responsible for the pens.” Great, just great. Went out to a club and got groped by a man. Politely asked him to stop. He didn’t so I asked him again. He hit me across the face. These are the fairly ‘big’ things that I remember acutely, but unfortunately it’s the culmination of the many little things that wear us down and can be difficult to challenge. All in all, anyone who things sexism is dead is very sadly mistaken. We all need to help each other out more – men and women together. "
"I work in an enterprise for adults with learning disabilities. Today the group were all male, and were bickering. The instructor, my boss, intervened by calling them “ladies”. Wtf? Happy International Women’s Day. You’re supposed to be a role model you dick. "
"I am 17, I work part time in a kitchen and the chef continuously sexualises and objectifies me. I consider myself an openminded, bright determined individual yet he sees straight passed this and only focuses on my body. It’s constant remarks about my appearance, how he would ‘do me’, sexual innuendos, invading my personal space. He even has pictures of me saved on his phone and tells me he ‘likes to look at them?’ and then picks out particular ones and tells me that ‘he really likes this one’. It’s hard to convey through writing how objectified this man makes me feel, he is twice my age and is constantly looking me up and down and giving me ‘looks’. I value myself a lot more on my body and face and it’s such a shame that some men in this day and age refuse to see past that. "
"Male colleagues asking how each was going to celebrate International Women’s Day. What a ridiculous notion! It’s not like there’s an International Men’s Day. In fact there is, its on 19 November, and I’d be pleased to celebrate it with all of you. "
"I am an American born Mexican woman. A few months ago I moved to Mexico (having never actually lived here, only visited family) for work. I work at a metal sales company and they often have company gatherings in the break room to celebrate birthdays, holidays, etc. All these gatherings revolve around free food for all employees. At these gatherings the men take their place at the tables and all the female employees are the ones who serve the food and pass it out to everyone. Now these women hold the same position as the men and some are even their supervisors, however Mexico is dominated by the patriarchal mentality and women often enforce this by playing into “traditional” roles of women in the kitchen. I sat down and noticed that only the women were helping in the food distribution process while the men lazily sat around waiting to be served. I was mind blown, and thinking, well if we all served ourselves we would all be eating way faster and enjoyably. I definitely brought this up to my male employer. "

"I was at work and returning a memory stick to a male colleague. The stick happened to be bright pink. His colleague turned to me and said “Have you swapped that for one of yours?”. I replied that it was not my stick. The first colleague then said it was his and he had been sent a random colour. The second colleague then said ‘It’s a bit girly isn’t it?” I then told him that I wasn’t keen on pink, because as a girl it had been foisted on me so often just because I was a girl when in fact, in the early 20th century, baby boys wore pink. He replied ‘What do you mean, when you were a girl? You’re still a girl aren’t you?”. I replied, no ‘I’m now a woman”. The whole view that if it’s pink it must be girly, or that you are not a proper woman if you don;t like pink is irksome enough without then infantilising me to a ‘girl’ instead of a woman. "
"My sister is a senior manager at a medium sized office. She will likely be made director later this year, becoming the second female director in the entire office. Just before Christmas she forwarded me the email she received from the receptionist – it was addressed to every single female in the office, and not a single male. It read ‘Hi Ladies, the Christmas decorations are sitting by the kitchen for those of you who would like to decorate the office’. Because obviously women’s jobs are less demanding and important than a man’s and can be readily put on hold in order to put tinsel around the workplace, and no man would ever be interested in decorating or be expected to.

"I’ve read on this site about another woman whose boss phoned her three months after she had left the company wanting “her input” ie.free consultancy work since she knows the job. This has also happened to other women I know well but not to any men. I’d honestly like to know (if any blokes are reading this, bless you if you are) whether it has happened to them because I suspect it’s a sexist thing. You leave the company but the boss still thinks you are his little helper who should work for free, I believe this is a legacy of the “women should work for free” attitude of so many older middle class management types (something explicitly said to my mum when she worked) So basically you have to change your phone as your old boss won’t leave you alone with his demands for help even though he stopped paying you ages ago. In one friends case her ex boss gave her number out to the other staff so they could contact her so they could get staff training several months after she left. They kept calling every few hours, demanding detailed explanations as he’d explicitly told them to call her before disappearing on permanent holiday – they were clueless and going mad because they didn’t know what they were doing. Of course had she not helped (they were all female) she’d have gone down as a nasty selfish lady but really why are women obliged to work in a herd? She was very good and actually did help them for a day or two, as it wasn’t their fault, which made her feel pretty compromised. He’d got his free staff training. But they didn’t stop calling. She had to change her number which was a real hassle. Good job she wasn’t self employed. Like I say I’d genuinely like to know if this is just something bosses do, but I’ve not heard it happening to males. I honestly don’t think most bosses wouldn’t dare ask a male ex employee to do free staff training several months after they’d left. Women are not your free help, support group, or your assistant. Women are not “natural teachers” either. Most people like to be supportive but women are expected to be – for free. I also had a close friend (age 30) have to spend months taking a client to the small claims court after he explicitly stated that he wouldn’t pay the invoice because she was female (he didn’t think a woman would chase the invoice as they were “less confident than men so you can muck them about” and “used to helping out for free.” ) His words. This was a complete surprise, she wasn’t a teenaged intern, she was an professional older woman with several years of blue chip consultancy work under her belt. But to him she was just a silly little girl to be mucked about and sneered at. Cost her several days of real work. Plenty of younger men get that this is not ok but the middle management older man problem is still a problem. I’m calling this stuff out on their behalf – they are insanely busy in their jobs and won’t even have time to get here and write it up. But they were both pretty stressed about it. "
"When I started working at my current job, there were approximately as many women as men in the team. While attending conferences and networking with people in the industry, I realized that our manager, a man, had a “reputation” for hiring many women. It was the general understanding that he did so because they are more pleasant to look at, and that he liked to work with pretty women around. At first I felt rather humiliated by these comments, as I had been flattered that he had chosen to hire me. But hiring people based on looks really did not sound like him. This man was married and had always had an appropriate behavior towards me and the other female staff as far as I knew. It made me angry that people could think that looks would be the only reason why a manager would hire many women in his team. Then we got a new boss. The male/female balance in the team changed rapidly. Whenever a female staff member was replaced, it was always by a man, until only two women remained in the team: me (his assistant) and the assistant of another guy. All other workers, project leaders, are now male. For some time, one female project manager remained in the team. The boss decided to appoint some external consultant, a man, to work with her on the project. She was the only project leader who had to do that, and whenever the three of them went on business trips to promote their project, the boss would introduce the guy around, and would sometimes ignore her. Of course it’s hard to prove that it’s because the boss does not trust women. But the fact remains that he seems to surround himself with men and he seems to prefer interacting with them. And yet, the boss with the slightly insulting reputation was the former one. Because he hired a fair amount of women, he was accused of hiring for looks, as if that’s all women could bring to a team. But no one raises an eyebrow when a manager only hires men. PS I apologize if there are mistakes, English is not my mother tongue. "
"Over the summer, I worked for a small organisation who ran a summer school. The sexism in the office was atrocious! The office staff, notably all female because according to the boss, admin is women’s work, were referred to by a senior member of staff as offices bitches in front of all the students. May I just add that the office staff are what held the summer school together but they were not valued in the slightest! On another occasion, when there was conflict between the two female office managers, the boss told a female member of staff that this must have happened because it was a full moon that week. It was certainly not said as a joke and the fact that he genuinely believed it was down to this, and not just a clash of personalities, is absolutely ridiculous and just outright sexist! I will not be working at the organisation again next year. "

"I was 19 and worked in a the shop of a small service station of my home town in Switzerland. I was family owned and most of the time didn’t have to complain about my work conditions, except the usual “are you not scared” because I was working alone at night. No, this definitely was not the problem. There were some awkward moments like when that 40 years old man wrote me a “love” letter but this was not the worst part of the story. Once one of the employees from the garage got his anniversary (I think it might have been 20 years in the company) it was in Summer, they threw a party at my boss’ place in the garden and I was invited which is “nice” considering I only worked at week-ends. People went there with there husbands/wives/partners, I was single so I went on my own, I was wearing jeans and a white top, showing a little bit of cleavage and with little straps (it was a very hot afternoon). It was one of the worst afternoon of my life. The men, including one of the owners of the garage, about 60 years old, spent the afternoon harassing me, taking photos of my cleavage and making very inappropriate comments about me (in front of their wives). At some point people starting playing with water guns and of course they aimed at me all the times and there my boss (the 60 years old guy) makes a comment “she’s wet” with a very obvious sexual meaning. I left and spent the whole evening crying. At the time I already knew I could complain, do something about it but I didn’t have the courage I think I have now I though that if I complained, being in a small village and everyone knowing the family that owned the service station and the garage, everyone would take their side I would be the crazy hysterical girl who looked for it because I was wearing some cleavage. Maybe they would even just say I was lying. One of the things that stroke me the most is there were almost as many women as men that day but no one took my defense, no one said one word to help me, not a single wife told her husband to shut the fuck up and leave me alone!

I repeatedly asked our consultant to reintroduce her previous medication but was always ignored, my female manager backed me up but was also ignored.

In the same office it was frequently me accused of putting the heating up -with calls of “it must be the *girls*” every time (little did they ever notice that I’m a bigger built woman and am very rarely cold – if anything I’m throwing windows open!) I spent a challenging few years of trying be heard, (in fact at one point my manager put his hand in my face and told me I wasn’t making a decent point, counteracted when I got my male colleague to repeat my ideas word for word(at which point they were enthusiastically received with an “Exactly! That’s what we need!”). I was also actively excluded from meetings as I was a junior. I wasn’t a junior. I was a woman.

At which point we both laughed and she said ‘No thanks, I wouldn’t want to rely on anyone that way’ and I agreed with her. His reply to that was directed to me was (as I am in a relationship) ‘Says the one living with her boyfriend’, I laughed at him and said that I choose to live with him and I do not rely on him, in fact he relies on me’.

"I started a new job and a male manager from another team somehow got my email address (I had never spoken to him in person, or even told him my name). He began sending suggestive, overly familiar emails, despite me not replying. It made me feel so incredibly uncomfortable. For months, I didn’t want to leave my desk or move my head in case we made eye contact as he sat opposite me across the room. I wanted to say something to my manager but as the messages weren’t overtly sexual or abusive, I wasn’t sure if I’d have a leg to stand on, and assumed my (male) manager may think I am making a fuss over nothing. I now understand it is not so much about the content, but about how it made you feel. "

"I’m a freelance producer. I’ve had an excellent 8 year relationship with one company who have been my major employer for those 8 years. Last fall I worked on a project for them where I was paired with a new male creative director where was subject to the most vicious, open and blatant abuse by this man who denigrated and degraded and humiliated me in every interaction I had with him, either in public or private. His Executive Managers did nothing to stop his inexcusable behaviour, such is the common culture within the industry to acquiesce to the most indefensible behaviour. One actively enabled him, by reinforcing his belief system that he was a “pretty big deal” and everyone else were “stupid, miserable c***ts”. The other passively enabled him by doing nothing. He didn’t just act this way towards me, but towards our client, also a woman, who had hired him for this project. Even acting this way towards our female client, in front of his manager, the manager did nothing to stop him, just sought to place the blame on her being “tricky and difficult”. The other manager told me that I didn’t have to worry about the situation, that he and I were cool “you know me, I know you, we both know what this is, you and I are fine”. Well I haven’t been hired by that company since. My major employer for 8 years that I didn’t have to worry about… Not only that but I haven’t worked at all since. The freelance world is pretty small. I’m now starting month 5 of unemployment. "
"Despite me graduating nearly at the top of my class in 2005, my mother suggested I could work as a secretary. She repeated the suggestion several years later when I’d graduated with honors in Psychology. I ignored her and continued my education. I went on to get a Ph.D. My brother (very successful himself) was once interested in a woman who worked as a lawyer at a prestigious law firm. My mother wasn’t too happy about that – she assumed the woman would be uncaring and not make a good wife and mother. She prefers women to stay at home once kids are in the picture. "
"I was really excited when back in the 90’s, as a newly qualified graphic designer, I landed a job at a small design studio. I should have known better as the previous employee had left after a few days, but lacking in confidence & in the midst of a recession, I was grateful for a job which was relevant to my training at art college. After 4 1/2 yeras, I quit, having been expected to work as the administrator and receptionist as well, which took up most of the working day, as well as making drinks & fetching supplies. This role was apparently ideally suited to me, being a woman, according to my boss, a self-confessed misogynist. I worked in a studio full of blokes, most of whom had little respect for women. By the time I left, my confidence in my talents was shattered and I haven’t worked in the industry since. I’m now in my late forties and feel that I have wasted my abilities. "
"Received an email from a male colleague, telling me he’d migrated to my office and would be sitting at my desk from now on. He “thought it courteous to give me a shout, and should I have a problem to let him know” I did have a problem I (only woman in department) now didn’t have a desk or anywhere to sit in the office, he now had two desks? when I pointed this out and asked him to return to his actual desk his response was “well motherhood hasn’t mellowed you”. At this point I thought talking about the issue was futile so I proceeded to sit at his actual desk and put his things into the bin. Yes a little passive aggressive but funnily enough he soon returned to this desk in a huff expressing I was an uptight bitch. "
"Several things have happened at work in the past week. The first thing was when my male colleagues were discussing the WWE and wrestling. I joined in and proceeded to demonstrate that my knowledge of the topic was greater than any of theirs. One of them asked me if I was a man or a woman, as he couldn’t tell anymore after that. These are the same people who laugh in my face when I insist I am capable of lifting things at work. The second thing that happened is a male colleague openly objectifying women passing on the street. He blatantly gawks at them as they walk by, very conspicuously craning his neck to do so, after which he says “Niiiiice!” loudly and unashamedly. It’s so demeaning. Another male colleague suggested that this behaviour might get him beaten by a man accompanying one of these women, for looking at “their women”. Thirdly, the worst thing to happen was yet another male colleague discussing his 20 month old son. His son has become very aggressive lately and kicks violently when being changed and frequently lashes out at strangers for no reason. I understand this; children need to behave like this from time to time to test their boundaries and so that parents can show them right from wrong and establish these boundaries when they lash out. My colleague doesn’t establish boundaries or reprimand his son. He has told us all that he encourages his son’s aggressive behaviour and is delighted by it, as he thinks it means his son will be dominant when he’s older. Toxic masculinity is instilled at a frighteningly young age.

"At work yesterday (male dominated, construction. Sexism everywhere) “Dragon’s breath” someman on the same training course as me said “what’s that?” I ask (big mistake) “where you cum in a birds mouth and then punch her in the nose so it bleeds, blood and cum; dragon’s breath”. When I exclaimed “you’re vile, vile” the trainer (male obv) looked at me to be quiet. "
"With a fresh degree you sometimes cannot find a suitable job for your qualification so you need to take what life gives, I went to work as a luxury car-valeter. I had to work among men of course. As a “naturally underestimated woman”I had to fight for my place. After 4 months of work a manager called me “Honey”. When I said I would have been preferred to be called by my name, another manager came to his help and called me “darling”. Later, he began visiting me more and more until one evening after work he invited me for a chat which led to a short sexual intercourse. I was ashamed so much I did not want to face the consequences which I already knew could be serious such as getting fired in case I do not continue this relation with the manager. Two days later, I found the same manager in the company of a 20-year-old girl (I was 39 at that time) who worked in an Internship there and just started it. It was clear to me that he was doing the same thing : flirting with her. She was a receptionist with nice and clean workplace as opposed to myself who worked as a valeter wearing always dirty clothes. I was relieved because I thought that the girl would keep him busy and away from me. It actually happened for some time, however when the girl went on holiday for a week he started harassing me as he called me a “spare-pussy in service” of him. Being married for a long time I was not very happy for his being otherwise indiscrete before my direct colleagues who made jokes on me and my husband time to time. As this manager highlighted to me that it would have been better, if I had taken up a “Friend with benefit” relationship with him, having no choice, I decided to quit my job. I thought I had left the whole thing behind when he started following me in the street and stalking me although, as I heard, he had had a 9 months long reliable relationship with the mentioned Internship-girl. Well, just for the record, I could understand her view of catching a “suit with a lot of money and a luxurious car…, but she was too young to understand that these men will “never buy the cow, if they can buy fresh milk” By the way, it is my strong belief that some companies consider Internship jobs as opportunities to get “the fresh milk”… This was a clear case of sexism which I still suffer from as the company I had left behind is trying to ruin my reputation ever since. I cannot name them as reference as I am afraid whey will tell lies about me so that they can sabotage my future career possibly everywhere else. I am considering leaving the town with my family to get rid of them for good. The company is covering up, he still has his juicy job, nothing affected his career. Meanwhile, they are spreading rumours about me that I am nothing but a troubled and deranged someone “who thought she was sexually harassed”. And, of course, I am unemployed ever since. I would like women to learn the lesson of my story. "
"I went to the local police to denounce someone for harassment. The policeman – a man- after asking questions of how it all had started, said this was nothing… women thought too much of it and it was basically much a do about nothing… When I told him it had all started after the man, a student of mine,had invited me to a coffee (something quite usual among adult students) and after pointing out that the conversation had been centred on MY boyfriend, the policeman said that women had to understand once and for all that men understood things differently and that we, women, sent them the wrong message by accepting a coffee. What is more, he said we had to understand men were like wild animals- the poor things- and couldn’t control their instincts. It was all so outrageous I wanted to shout. But then I would have been charged with shouting at a policeman, which, in itself, is a crime. To make matters worse, this policeman tried to make me not denounce this man formally, not only once, but repeatedly along the hour and a half the whole -and painful- progress took. He repeated again and again that, in his experience, this was not going to proceed as a crime. Today the person I reported has been charged with harassment and there will be a trial. All I can now think of is how grateful I was to everybody who supported me to go on with the process… despite this policeman’s “advice” and how victims of serious sexual assault or domestic violence must feel when they have to go through the ordeal of confronting such a policeman in such delicate situations. As a child I was raised by parents who understand parenting is something indistinctively adressed to both parts within marriage, I was taught to play with toys independently of what sex they are oriented at and I never felt I was raised as a girl but as a person… as an educated woman in her 30s, society continuously surprises and shocks me with how women’s matters are discarded as much a do about nothing.

"This is my first visit to this page, the link was sent to me by someone who contacted me about workplace bullying, and I am appalled at the stories being told here.

I will certainly follow this group on Twitter â€“ and tell everyone I know about it. "

One day he came in while I stood whith my back turned , liftig a heavy tray filled with glasses. He snuck up behind me and tried to touch my breasts. On purpose i dropped the whole tray, all the glasses broke. He nearly lost his job, and I was never bothered by him again. "

"My job was very demanding. After refusing to romantically date someone on my team, I lost my position, 90% of my opportunities, respect and equal standing in the group. I was also bullied by several people. If I had given up my body for protection against harassment and loosing my position, things would have been different. My boss thinks he is 100% innocent and that it was me who had all the problems. He doesn’t realize that I don’t want to sleep with people to keep my position or for protection. The stress was very triggering and the bullying at work lasted for a year and a half. I now have health problems and had to leave my job because I was too sick to come back to work. My company is not paying for my health insurance and I am now unemployed. All of this happened because I didn’t want to sleep with someone or be their girlfriend. "
"So today I was harassed by a cab driver from the other side of the street. Never even understood what he was saying- just whistles and a creepy whisper. Nothing new about that, right? But then, came to the office and told my female friend about it- how you leave your house motivated and in peace on a Monday morning and suddenly these things invariably ruin your mood. The other -male- friend witnessing the conversation chimes in: ” Just the passions Dr. MD awakes”. *Sigh*. No my dear, that is not passion. ItÂ´s harassment. IT IS NOT A COMPLIMENT. "
"Today my friend told me a story about when she was on a bus with a few people on it. She was sitting in her seat. There’s this guy that gets on the bus, and sits away from her, but he starts to stare at her, which she notices. She didn’t do anything. Then, this prick gets up from his seat, sits next to her, and puts his arm around her! She didn’t do anything (and she shouldn’t have to BECAUSE HE SHOULDN’T BE DOING THAT), and eventually he got up and left. Yuck. How is it that men, and not women, are socialized to think this kind of harassment is ok???? Like, street harassment, workplace harassment, sexual harassment at events, its a man who does these things most of the time, and a woman being the target most of the time. Meanwhile you hardly ever hear of a woman harassing someone like this, or a man being the victim of something like this. I know it’s a product of basic sexism in our society but it still amazes me, the difference. "
"So a male colleague who I don’t normally work with, insisted on carrying all of the not-even-heavy equipment today even though I am quite capable of carrying it. I am not used to this kind of behaviour and although it sounds minor, it was very uncomfortable and seemed that he thought I was too weak and pathetic to do my job. If this wasn’t bad enough, I found out this same colleague had requested another male to work with him for a particular task instead of myself, even though this was an area I am particularly qualified in and have worked in for years, which makes me think he has a problem with women or is trying to freeze me out intentionally. I haven’t really had to deal with sexist people before and am not sure how to approach it, but I need to speak to him about the issue soon before it gets worse. Perhaps I should ask my line manager if I can work with someone else. "

"I’m a freelance producer. I’ve had an excellent 8 year relationship with one company who have been my major employer for those 8 years. Last fall I worked on a project for them where I was paired with a new male creative director where was subject to the most vicious, open and blatant abuse by this man who denigrated and degraded and humiliated me in every interaction I had with him, either in public or private. His Executive Managers did nothing to stop his inexcusable behaviour, such is the common culture within the industry to acquiesce to the most indefensible behaviour. One actively enabled him, by reinforcing his belief system that he was a “pretty big deal” and everyone else were “stupid, miserable c***ts”. The other passively enabled him by doing nothing. He didn’t just act this way towards me, but towards our client, also a woman, who had hired him for this project. Even acting this way towards our female client, in front of his manager, the manager did nothing to stop him, just sought to place the blame on her being “tricky and difficult”. The other manager told me that I didn’t have to worry about the situation, that he and I were cool “you know me, I know you, we both know what this is, you and I are fine”. Well I haven’t been hired by that company since. My major employer for 8 years that I didn’t have to worry about… Not only that but I haven’t worked at all since. The freelance world is pretty small. I’m now starting month 5 of unemployment. "

"A few years back, I worked as a recruiter of freelance consultants for engineering projects. When I was hired, my female boss took me to her office and told me explicitly that they never hired women because they are too much trouble, although of course we couldn’t ever say that in public or make it clear in any way to any female candidates. A bit later, a senior female recruiter with a big reputation was hired to work with us. She boasted that she had hired only two female consultants in her whole career, and even those two she regretted. “Women always give problems. They only care about their children, and don’t get the job done”, she said. She would know, she had a child herself. I didn’t confront them because it felt very awkward coming from women, and they both brushed off laughingly my surprise. They looked very smug for some reason. Never heard any such remark from my male coworkers. Another time, I came with the ideal candidate for a project. Only problem was, he came from an Eastern European country. My colleague in sales didn’t want to introduce him to our customer. When confronted, he gave me a weird look of understanding, like something had clicked in his head, and proceeded to explain me carefully that he didn’t mind himself where the guy was from, but the customer would, so it was pointless to give him a chance in the first place. Not sexism, but racism this time. I got the impression that all these practices were systemic but somehown hushed up, so they could never be openly acknowledged, even less confronted. "

I was at the bar in a pub, waiting to get my drinks when a random guy, drunk as anything, walks up to me and says “you have a massive ass you babe” I just looked at him and said “and your point is?”. He looked confused and stared at me so I asked him again why he felt the need to comment on the size of my ass, his reply was “for fucks sake it’s a compliment” to which I replied it as a statement of fact, that my bum is big, and he had no business commenting on my body in any way shape or form. The guy walked off muttering about “fucking dykes, fucking feminism” and my friends asked me why I can’t just take a compliment. I don’t feel like being overly sexualised when I’ve gone for a pint (I was also told I would look more ladylike with a half pint instead) with friends to relax after work is a compliment. I used to love receiving “compliments” and catcalls like this because I felt sexy and appreciated, It was only when I realised I don’t need any male to tell me I’m worthy of their approval, that my sense of self worth is more important than their ugly belittling remarks.

"I am a 24-year old woman working full-time at a steel producing company in South Korea. It has been a year and a half now, and the experiences I had here made me a feminist. On my first day at the office, August 18th 2015, I was told by a deputy general manager that, “You will face many disadvantages because you are female. You should be aware of that. It’s better than not knowing at all, right?”. Weeks later I was told by the same man that I will not be able to go to business trips because he does not like to work with women. He also said that he did not understand why I applied and got into this company, when this is a steel company and therefore male. Last October, I (luckily?) went on my first business trip (with a different boss) to Vietnam and the Philippines and caught the fellow men engaging in sex tourism (possibly a sexual massage, or prostitution) and heard them lie about it, that they were having a foot massage. But later one man confessed that they were engaging in a ‘female not allowed, male-only activity’. Ever since I feel the urge to puke whenever I hear the term ‘Vietnam’ or ‘Sex tourism’. This is actual PTSD. There are billions of similar examples that happened to me in my company. Currently I am writing a novel based on my experiences, hoping to get it published next year. Now I write down every single, trivial episodes of my daily life at the office, finding resources for my book. South Korea is a very misogynist country, with the majority of men who don’t even try to accept the fact that they are misogynists. "
"I’m a high school teacher and am surrounded by hormone driven teenagers, but they are absolutely nothing compared to the male members of staff. While they keep it professional around the students (I’ve been keeping an eye out for that, sharply), I now almost start believing that they had some sort of secret agreement to “blow off excess steam” with me. I started feeling odd after school about 3 months ago, so I paid more attention to what was going on all day long, and then I started counting the tiny everyday sexist comments and made note of who they came from. I got a religious education teacher, an IT teacher, an economy teacher, an English teacher, a French teacher, a PE teacher, a Psychology teacher, the comments just kept coming. I got wolf whistled, people commenting on the length of my skirt or dress, people commenting on how my buttoned-up blouse made them think of catholic boarding school phantasies, people telling me to bend over, how they feel on form today and would like me to get into their car back seat, how I should enjoy all the liberties I have now that I’m not married, how they planned to tell their significant other that they’d be working late so they could come to my flat instead, how sexy they thought I was, how they of course didn’t mean anything by it, how they like it when I eat bananas, how they’d gladly provide me with blown-out eggs (I wanted to do some easter decoration with the younger kids) provided I did the blowing myself, how they lose track of their thoughts when I walk by, how they think I shoudn’t teach, because which kid could possibly concentrate with me in the room, how they think I should only teach while facing the students’ backs, how they like walking behind me, how they like watching me walk towards them, how they casually touch my arm or shoulder or back, how they think I am in bed, how they think about getting things going with me, how they mean it as a compliment, because would I rather be sexy or not?, how much they like me in clothing suitable for the warmer months and so on and so forth. I have stopped eating bananas, and wearing heels, wearing dresses or skirts, wearing buttoned-up blouses and doing my hair in four different hairstyles. I seriously bought a baggier, shapeless pair of jeans and a jumper and blazer a size too big. In the mornings I think about what I can wear and who will comment on what I’m wearing and whose comments I can stomach. When I walk around school and the faculty lounge I avoid places where they are, and keep a low profile. I would SO MUCH like to report them to SOMEBODY, but that would make work life unbearable. I once told the most persistent one to please stop it because it makes me uncomfortable. He told me it was all in my head because he was married, why would I even say such a thing? Then he was mad at me for like 2 weeks, and then back to the beginning. I now stopped talking to them and just look at them and walk away when they say these things. I used to have funny and quick-witted retorts,but I berated myself for engaging in their banter, telling myself that of course they’d say these things when they can expect a funny reply, so now I just look and walk away. And that sucks. I change the way I dress and walk and talk and behave so as not to attract unwanted attention. "

But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. Nelson was stunned because she viewed the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. "

"I’m an officer in the military. One morning, I told a junior sailor to shave before he left work that day, because a clean-shaven face is a part of our uniform regulations. Fast-forward to the end of the day and this sailor still has not shaved. Therefore, I confront the senior sailor who directly supervises this junior sailor and he justifies the junior’s actions by telling me that the sailor did not have a razor on board and thought it would not be hygienic to shave with someone else’s razor and that I should understand because I would not want to shave my legs with someone else’s razor. Outside of the fact that there are indeed razors available (there’s a whole store with basic necessities like that in easy reach), I thought it was incredibly inappropriate to bring up my legs and how I shave them into the conversation. I give the sailor a formal counseling and he still refuses to admit that what he said was inappropriate. What’s more, none of my colleagues or supervisors (all male) supported me. I now accused of being “sensitive” and my peers make fun of me. While that is bothersome, it also ended up being liberating in a way. There had been some other sexist behaviors that I had ignored because I didn’t want that label — I wanted to be an exception to the “typical” woman in the military, where men view me a a fellow servicemember, not a “female servicemember.” But now that I’ve gained the “sensitive” description, I feel freer to point these things out. I demanded that offensive memes and unprofessional memes be taken off the walls of the offices (not only am I now “Sensitive” but a “Sensitive Killjoy”). When a subordinate told me I looked like a particular actress I’ve never heard of and then shows me a naked photo of the actress and says “that’s her,” I stop him and tell him he’s not being appropriate (now I’m a “Sensitive Killjoy Who Can’t Take a Compliment).

"Calling people ‘mum’ / ‘mums’. This seemed odd and jarring when marketing for Iceland supermarkets started using it about 10 years ago, but very quickly this has become ubiquitous, and not simply by advertisers greedily pursuing a target demographic. As an example, the wife of the former Prime Minister, Sarah Brown, describes herself thusly in her twitter profile: “@SarahBrownUK mum, charity campaigner, writer, enthusiastic chirper, believer in good things”. We also have the notorious ‘mumsnet’. This is a real change in the use of the word in a very short space of time (although I suspect that across the Atlantic, “mom” and “moms” has had this kind of usage for rather longer). And I will admit that I HATE it. Why is this? Well, as I was growing up, ‘mum’ was basically a proper name, like Peter or Jessica. It was the name by which most people (or some variation, e.g. mama, mother, mam etc) addressed their own mothers. It was internal to a personal relationship: child-to-mother. By being co-opted by advertisers, pressure groups, or even individuals who seek to use it as a definition of their occupation, it ceases to be descriptive of a personal relationship between two individuals, but it becomes public property. “Mums” are now a social group of some kind, just like “doctors” or “freemasons”. Perhaps you think this is a good thing. Perhaps you like being a ‘mum’ in this public sense. If so, then I bow to your personal experience. You might say that you would rather see the word pushed into the public sphere so that issues of women and childcare are given the prominence they deserve. Certainly, I can see why people prefer it to “stay-at-home-mum” or “housewife”. Maybe you agree with Sarah Brown that by putting it to the list of her occupations, it is given the public status it deserves, a professional status, like ‘teacher’ or ‘doctor’. I do believe that issues of women and childcare should be given greater prominence in our public sphere and public debate, but I HATE the brandishing of the word ‘mum’. For one thing, I think the expropriation of the word was invasive to those personal relationships, but for another, this new usage doesn’t just mean ‘female parent’ or even ‘mother’. It is extremely loaded with patriarchal and regressive attitudes. ‘Mum’ in the new usage implies woman as primary caregiver. If you are to believe the advertisers, it implies exactly what ‘stay-at-home-mum’ and ‘housewife’ mean. It implies that there is a correct model for childrearing that involves women as fulltime caregivers, a departure from which makes you a bad parent. If you professionalise ‘being a mum’, it implicitly suggests that membership of any other profession makes you part-time at both, and therefore a second-class amateur at both. I think, unconsciously, through the use of a single syllable, we reinforce these sexist ideas that women’s careers should end at childbirth, or that working mothers are bad mothers. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that in the same period since this word suddenly changed its meaning, we have also had the ‘woman as superwoman’ or ‘women as accomplished multitaskers’ trope, which inevitably suggests that women are attempting to juggle too much, that they are exhausted, that they will inevitably fail to keep both motherhood and career going, and ultimately, will have to choose (with motherhood, inevitably, being the only choice “for every woman”). These narratives limit women and women’s choices. They reinforce the tired ‘biology’ arguments for sexism – (that women ‘naturally’ want to stay at home). They encourage the merest lipservice to workplace equality. Please don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that there is anything wrong at all with a woman deciding that when she wants to have children, she wants to be a fulltime caregiver. What I am talking about it the cultural imperative towards that choice, or society choosing that for her through subtle, almost hidden pressures. "

"When I was younger I was a manual labourer, working in a primarily male dominated world There was obvious inequality in pay between contractors & company employees doing the same job & some obvious sexism to (the current boss felt women weren’t physically capable of doing the job). I always felt strongly that this was wrong & should be addressed & was glad to hear after I left that a woman had been taken on to do doing the job I used to do. I really struggled when I initially got this job I was around 20-30kg lighter than most of the other men there being naturally smaller in stature & a lot of people didn’t think I would last. However I persevered & my body eventually adapted. Later on in the year I inquired as to how my replacement was doing, “she has been moved to an easier job as she complained she wasn’t strong enough to do it” was the response, followed with “She isn’t much good in the new one either, keeps using the excuse that she is weaker than us to try & avoid the harder jobs”. I asked when they would be firing her as you wasn’t able to do the job by her own admission, “I think they are too scared to in case she claims sexism” This really annoyed me as lots of people included myself struggled with this job physically, some quit & most who weren’t physically capable were sacked as they were unable to do the job. Not being as strong as your co workers was not a viable excuse as I knew only to well. I had to take my turn on the harder jobs the same as everyone else even if they were a lot more physically capable than me. However in this instance it seems to be ok if you are a woman but not if you are a man. Hopefully woman will be able to apply for these roles in future & be given a fair chance to prove themselves as I was & be sacked if they cannot do it or kept on if they can exactly the same as their male co workers.

Frequently, male marketing managers (yes, more than just one) will email my male colleague directly, without copying me, on a project that I am leading on. This week alone I have three examples from two different marketing managers who have emailed my colleague instead of me, asking for something to be supplied or confirming important details on a project I am running. In one of these instances I had been on copy with one of these marketing managers minutes before discussing the same project, yet when he wanted to email us to confirm on something that needed to be implemented, I was left off copy and it was addressed directly to my male colleague. In the same week, a different marketing manager (same client/company) emailed my colleague to ask for something. I was then copied in by my colleague and I supplied what was needed. The next day the same person again emailed my colleague directly to ask for something else on the same project. Again, I was copied in to confirm. It has occurred to me this week that because I am being copied in to supply what is needed, I am now convinced that these marketing managers have assumed I am my colleague’s assistant, as opposed to considering that I am being copied because I am the one with the necessary knowledge. This is despite the fact that I have worked closely with one of these marketing managers on delivering one of their biggest projects of 2015. I have been in a room with my male colleague and one of these marketing managers has walked in, walked straight past me without even acknowledging me, and headed straight to my colleague, hand outstretched, greeting him with ‘hey buddy’. I have been at the company for two years and at first this behaviour was very annoying but it is now just completely insulting. I work incredibly hard and have delivered some of the biggest projects for this client during this period. It makes me furious to be constantly overlooked by this client who either doesn’t even know me well enough after two years to be able to bring my name to mind when starting a new email chain, or just doesn’t trust me enough to come to me with important details – despite the fact that I have proved myself time and time again and am very capable of doing anything he comes to us for. This week I have told my colleague that I am sick of it and it is not enough for him to be copying me, he needs to explain that he is copying me because I am running the project in question. "
I work in a cafe and was shocked when my boss asked whether the meal was for a boy or a girl and then when I told her proceeded to give me a plate with lions on it rather than the gingerbread one for “girls” its little things like this that annoy me I mean come on its just a plate! 
"My job requires me to engage with people all day, every day. My job requires me to understand a person’s needs, find solutions for them and ultimately, have them choose the service I am proposing. My job requires that I see my potential or existing clients socially and build relationships with them. I’m lucky that I am a social person and enjoy the experiences that each person I meet can share with me. But I’m not so lucky that for every fascinating person I meet in a professional setting there are at least 3 people who have zero respect for me in my capacity as a young and intelligent woman. These are the men who will constantly interrupt me during a business lunch, no matter how important what I’m saying is, to tell me my eyes are beautiful. These are the men who will ask me what my star sign is only to reply “Scorpio! Dangerous and sexy.” These are the men who will mistake my smile and agreement to a business deal as an encouragement that I want them. These are the men who are gentlemen enough to walk me to my hotel whilst we’re at an out-of-town a conference, only to ask if they can come up to my room with me. These are the men who call me “trouble” like I could make them lose all control and make them do things they wouldn’t normally do. I’ve been socialised to be able to get past the part where he tries: I guess if a man feels so strongly about me that he must say something or make a pass, then that’s what a man must do. “Who can blame a guy for trying?” But the part where I see red, where I feel disrespected, where I realise to them I’m just an object is when they say “… it won’t change anything.” How dare they? How dare they suggest that they can take advantage of me, use me, have their way with me in whichever way they please and then wake up in the morning and resume a professional working relationship with me like nothing has happened? Am I that much of an object to them that they think they can pick me up, use me, put me down and I will remain unchanged? No. Just the very act of a man prioritising the way I look over what I have to say affects me. And it tells me everything I need to know about him. He will never respect a woman. He will never love a woman for her truest beauty. He will never be with a woman in totality. He is missing out. He is only living half a life. I wish I knew how to respond. I wish I knew how to make these men see how the way they treat me and every other woman makes us feel. And I wish that all the other people who dismiss my stories with a “take it as a compliment” understood that by saying that they are not making it any better. As I grow my career and build my reputation my one goal will be to stand up to these men, to make them realise. I don’t know how yet. But watch this space. "
"Last night was the work’s Christmas Party. I was sexually assaulted by a fellow employee I’d never met before. When I challenged him he called me a ‘freak’ and a ‘weirdo’. Upon reporting this to other party goers (including my manager) I was met with the response ‘we could ask security to get him thrown out but it’s just your word against his.’ Unbeknownst to me, the attacker was also a manager…funny that. Today I went to the police station to report it and had a police officer called me back asking if i ‘really wanted to go through the entire process of making a complaint, getting the cctv (which captured the incident) and then getting him arrested and possibly going to court’ or if I just wanted to leave it as there was alcohol involved (a pretty big assumption given that I don’t drink). I’m furious that this sort of treatment is deemed as being acceptable by my workplace (a bank operating in 40 countries worldwide) and the police. "
"I’m tired of giving a full and detailed response to a query which 100% answers whatever the problem is and being told “okay I will ask (insert name of male colleague who is not my superior) ” Huh? Because he has a penis he will give you a better answer, even though you already have your answer? "
Today I was working (in Tesco) and I was having a friendly chat with the security guard and a customer when another customer comes up and starts randomly saying how “women should be kept in their place” and “they cause all the trouble in the world”. I didn’t hesitate to tell him where to go and thankfully my manager was supportive (even although there was some swear words involved). I can’t believe men like this still exist! 
"As a soldier I am extremely proud of what I do. Unfortunately in the pub last night the group of men I work with and believed had mutual respect with told me that “seeing a woman in uniform is wrong, but not to worry cause it’s different with Jo”. Obviously a huge row ensued and I felt completely devastated by it. Last week we had mountain training, I am extremely fit and train hard, I lead the group all week. In the same evening I was told that being that fit was just me “trying to prove something”. Why can’t I go up a mountain and lead the group without my gender being the issue?! Furious and sad. I know men leading the group like that would not be told they are trying to prove something, it would just be the speed they go up the mountain. Really inspired by this project to stand up for myself more. Interesting that I don’t feel confident enough to put my full name down. "
"My new manager at work had started hiring new staff for the christmas period. It became clear quite quickly that he was only employing girls as waitresses, and asked for a picture to be sent with every CV. Unless he deemed the girls “attractive” he wouldn’t even read their CVs. When I confronted him saying it was wrong to hire people based on their looks he said “You can’t train the ugly out of someone.” Sadly this is deemed as normal in hospitality to only have good looking female staff. Sexism is still rife in the workplace! "
"I have been through so much sexism in the workplace that the mind reels. However I do have a favorite occasion. I was engineering for a major artist in the recording studio and we had someone from the label visit and even though I was sitting at the console with my hand on the buttons he kept referring questions to the guy in the back of the room, who would then shrug and look at me and I would answer the question. Finally I got mad and introduced the guy in the back who was just there to fix an electrical outlet and had no idea what we were talking about. EVEN THEN the label guy wouldn’t direct questions to me. He KEPT ON looking at that guy and directing his questions to him. It was hilariously ridiculous. I just feel sorry for men like that. "
I complained to my bosses about a co worker because of his sexist comment to women at my workplace. This morning he told me to BE QUIET WOMAN. BE QUIET WOMAN AND GO. He would now slam doors really loud and provoke me at all times. I work in a primary school. He is a teaching assistant. 
"Just found out that the women in my company are holding a Women Only dinner party. If we’re all the same and shit, why hold an event that only half the company can take part? "
Had to explain to a male colleague today why ‘cat calling’ was not a compliment. Can’t believe such a conversation needs to take place in 2016. He re – buffed my explanation later by covertly taking a photo of my back side and then proudly showing it to me. 
"In my last job we worked with a lot of car dealers, and on one occasion I was accompanying a colleague of mine to a meeting. I wore a professional and formal dress and some nice shoes, and thought nothing of it. During the meeting the manager kept looking at me inappropriately, and at one point in the meeting forced a female member of staff to share his seat with him, whilst clearly eyeing her up. She just giggled along with it, it was clearly a common occurrence. On returning to the office I received an email from the manager that started (never a good sign!) with “I hope this isn’t inappropriate but”, and then following up with comments on my appearance. I felt really dirty. As a bit of a beacon of hope, however, my managing director (male) then rang him up and informed him that he couldn’t behave inappropriately towards his staff and that it was unacceptable, I was so grateful it was taken seriously! My workplace were dodgy minded and inappropriate about everything, but in the best way possible (honestly, SO much fun!) – but the industry in which we worked was a bit less forward thinking. On another occasion during a meeting with a car dealer at a rugby club (re: sponsorship) the man we were meeting at spent the entire meeting talking to my male colleague. despite me being the expert on the topic. The only time he looked at me (literally, unfortunately) was when he referred to bras. Clearly that was all I could understand! "

I was talking to a group of female friends the other day and we got on to the subject of harassment we’ve experienced from male strangers. Not one out of our group of 6 didn’t have a story along the lines of ‘a male stranger grabbed my thigh/breast/leg etc’ on public transport or in the workplace. In all instances we agreed that we felt really intimidated and powerless. These experiences make us feel like we’re not 100 percent safe going about our daily lives. 
"My story isn’t as tragic and overwhelming as some of the others on here. I’m lucky to have been raised by a single, working, military woman who taught me to be strong and proud of being a human being. But since we have moved back to Tennessee and are checking out Christian churches I’ve notice a lot of small and subtle things. I work at Hobby Lobby and have had little stereotypical comments made by management, coworkers and customers. All our cashiers are women and only two of four of our staff of fifty are African American. At church just this Subday we were talking about the biblical view on divorce and they kept talking about the Samaratian woman with five husbands. It took 30 minutes and another girl to ask, “what about the men? The are sinning if they commit adultery and remarry right?” Even at my cousin’s wedding they kept talking about “wife submitting to husband”. What about him!? This guy is great but why isn’t it important to verify that it’s wrong if he isn’t commited either! Like I said not too noticeable but still present. "
"Working at a fast food place, I had an older man with his wife and grandson came in. When I tried to take his money at the register he grabbed my wrist and stroked his fingers over my tattoos. He kept his eyes locked on mine and said “Daddy doesn’t like this.” His wife just walked away and sat down. Then he played the pull away game with his money, tugging it just out of reach to try to make me work for it. All of my coworkers just looked away, including the female manager. "
"A friend asked me to review her CV before sending it. She asked me if she should mention her marital statut. None of my guy friends ever ask me that question. Then, I told her to never do that because it will always come back to bite you where it hurts : if you have children, you will be seen as a person that is not dependable, never available, not implicated and that will only ever care for her brood; if you don’t have any children and are above 21, you will be expected to get pregnant and go on a maternity leave within the first year of your hire. There’s no way to win, so avoid it altogether if you can. Save it for the job interview where you’ll say it’s a private matter with as much diplomacy you can muster. "
"As a woman in tech and music, conversation with men is difficult. When I speak and someone responds, I (almost) always pause and allow the other person to think aloud and add to the conversation. I have always done this and it comes naturally to me. However, I often do not receive this curtesy from men. I find that constantly, and I mean constantly, men simply speak over me as a form of acknowledgment. Not only do they speak over me, but they raise their voice. And they continue away going on and on about whatever as if they didn’t passive aggressively shut me up. Im 23, is this my life? Is this life? Why "
"One day I did my hair a little different, put in some earrings and wore a little more make up than usual for work. This was in a effort to feel good about myself as I’d been a bit low. My female supervisor asked me if i had a fancy man. "
In college I worked at a professional office and had to dress up for work. This one guy was much older and would make random inappropriate comments. One day he whistled and said “nice legs!” I don’t know what came over me but I freaked out at him and told him to Shut Up and asked him if he thought I liked his gross comments. He was shocked and became angry and said “someone must really love you for you to talk like that” and I said “YES you’re right.” At least he left me alone after that. Looking back I provably should have been more careful because I angered him and he could have stalked and attacked me. 
"Okay, I’m 24 years old, and I’m gay. I come from Cambodia, where being gay is considered to be the frightful thing most people are aware of. When I was in high school, most of my classmates called me names and worse labelled me as “a-boy-who-likes-dicks.” As I wasn’t really into fights, I kept ignoring their aggressive actions. It was getting worse and worse with each passing day that it resorted to be physical violence. To illustrate, they started to corner me, beat me to the ground and throw jokes on me. I remember tears streaming down my face when I was walking alone to home with bruises and bandages. I lied to my parents that a car hit me, for I knew that they were really, really anti-gay. I hated this society, and I still do. Why does sexism have to be more important than a human’s life? "
"Here are a few gems from my time in the tech industry: “Do you have a sister? Is she Katy Perry?” Harasser: “Hey Sophie!” Me: “That’s not my name.” Harasser: “Oh sorry I was distracted by your dress.” This was said with a male manager watching the whole thing, who did and said nothing. “Hey is there a birthday party in the building today? Because you’re dressed to kill.” Then there was the guy who asked me out to lunch after stopping at my desk at least five times a day to say hi or tell me to smile. Apparently he was just interested in the work I do. There is also the guy who was ogling me so much that a colleague reported his behaviour toward me to our manager. He was left working ten feet away from me until his contract ran out, so that they wouldn’t have to go through the mess of firing him. The impact to me was considered irrelevant. The boss took him out for lunch on his last day to thank him. Nothing has ever been done for me by the HR team, despite me reporting every single one of these incidents. I am now working at home in exile because of the latest incident, which I also reported. Apparently, I am the cancer or the contagion who needs to be removed. It’s been three weeks and no word on what they are going to do about my situation. Welcome to IT, women of the world. You would have better luck on a construction site, by far. "
"So many to choose from. 1) Working as a temporary secretary aged 19, the boss would put his hand on mine on the mouse, touch my neck, ask me what perfume I was wearing (I don’t wear perfume) and once took me to lunch and tried to get me drunk. I didn’t drink anything, and he proceeded to get wasted until I excused myself. I later bumped into him on a train. He was drunk and repeatedly asked me to come home with him, made sexual remarks etc. When he got up to go to the loo the other passengers rallied around, took his seat and wouldn’t let him sit back down when he returned. Some people are wonderful. 2) A man sat down at the booth I was in at a bar while my partner went to the bar. He started chatting and seemed friendly enough. It was a student bar in an adult education college and early in the evening, so I was used to talking to people about their courses etc. When my partner came back and I introduced him the guy told me I was a total bitch for parading my boyfriend in front of me, as if he was trying to hit on me. 3) Endless catcalling, whistles, kissing noises, ‘hey baby’ etc. in the street, from about the age of 13 to my early thirties. Too many to count, and it makes no difference what I’m wearing. Cycling is quite bad — do they think you won’t stop to question them? I generally cycle in a hoodie, helmet, black leggings and trainers. Not desperately alluring, but it’s not about that, is it? 4) A plumber came to price a job and found he’d forgotten his screwdriver. I lent him mine. He asked ‘Why do you have a screwdriver?’ Baffling. 5) Some boys, aged about 11, asked me the time, then told me I had a nice arse. I was 29 years old at the time. They obviously like to start young.

"At my old place of work, they had a page three calendar up in the stores office. Just to be contrary we asked if we could put up a topless male calendar in our office (where only women worked, and no-one else had any reason to go). The manager told us no, it would be inappropriate, because a man might go in there and see the sexy firemen or whatever and feel inadequate. We pointed out the page three, blatantly surgically enhanced calendar in stores, where everyone had to go, and he said “well that’s different, that’s a male-orientated workplace.” You can’t make this stuff up. At the same place there was some creepy guy (and by creepy I mean he once followed my friend home). Constantly used to say things like ‘Oh it’s that lovely gorgeous girl!’ when I walked past. I hated it, and I tried multiple times to ask him to stop, but I didn’t want to be seen as a ‘bitch’ so I tried to be nice about it. Things came to a head when he announced to the whole tea room that he knew I fancied him, because I would blush whenever he paid me a compliment. Everyone just started laughing. I told him I blushed because I found his compliments uncomfortable and awkward, and everyone was all ‘ooh she protests too much’. After that, I gave up on being nice to him, wouldn’t even give him eye contact. Told this same story to a male friend, and his sympathy was with the guy…. "
"I am a teacher of children who are badly behaved and excluded from school. I have a group of 5 boys and 1 girl who are all vulnerable, badly behaved and low ability. They have a variety of problems. The girl is routinely blamed for the bad behaviour of the whole group. Although only 13 years old, she is characterised by my mostly male colleagues as a ‘bitch’, a ‘temptress’, as manipulative and leading the group of boys. These men seem to be projecting their ideas about women generally onto a vulnerable child, and excusing the bad behaviour of the boys. This makes me very angry and worried for other young women who are in difficult situations. "
The company I work for just promoted a man who has been officially recognized guilty of sexual harassment and bullying towards women – those events took place in the same company. Some of his victims still work in it. 
"I am only 31 but I have so many examples of sexism to choose from including harassment and assault but this one was really significant for me. I was paid less than a younger male colleague who started at the same time; despite the fact that I had an equal position, many more qualifications and work experience. This was in Australia (no legislation at that time(and I believe there still isn’t) to fight my case through legal channels), and I was told that it was normal here (I am from the UK) because women tended to leave to have children and weren’t worth the investment. What made me particularly cross; other than the obvious, was the attitude of the women in the company. I worked in a male dominated environment and they felt that I was lucky to get the job in the first place and that I should not make a fuss otherwise it would reflect badly on them. I made an official complaint and was asked to leave; which I refused, then sacked on bogus terms. Two people in that company resigned out of principle over the incident, both of which were male, one of them I eventually married although I didn’t know him prior to his resignation. Suprisingly this did have an effect, both of the men who resigned had key jobs in the company and it drew a lot of unwanted publicity which resulted in new management. This taught me two things. Firstly, there are people who are enlightened enough to take a stand with you and when they do, it speaks volumes. I would always stand up against discrimination in any situation including the workplace because I understand how vital this is to the person discriminated and to my sense of self. Secondly, make a complaint! You may not feel that you are making an impact but you may be surprised. It can give other people the courage to make a stand at the same time. It also made me feel less powerless. Even though I did not win any great legal battle, I felt I had done something and was no-longer a victim. "
I am a doctor working in a+e. I was removing a man’s dressing when he said ‘you’re a ‘kinky bitch aren’t you?’ 
"Several times on the way to uni I experienced a man who looked in his 40s get in my face and make ‘kissy’ noises at me. It was very intimidating and although I thought I might not be taken seriously as he hadn’t touched me, I went to the police. They were so supportive, walking with me on the way to uni so I could point him out, taking him to the police station and later giving him an official caution. They thanked me repeatedly for coming forward and told me he was doing this to loads of women and that they thought if I hadn’t reported it the situation could have escalated. Reporting these things isn’t always easy and it’s common to feel like you’ll be turned away but my experience has been so positive and I now have so much trust in the police in my city. Stay safe everyone x "
It pisses me off that when you just simply look/glance at men they think EVERY woman wants them. Why do they naturally assume that?! Then they makes insensitive comments like I’m taken…while seemingly looking deep into your eyes!!! Now I’ve been called “Bedroom Eyes since I was a little girl toddler. And I never intentionally flutter them at a man that is “so called happily MARRIED”but and I never stated that I find a man attractive unless he take the intuitive. I think most men are flattering themselves at my expense or most likely they insecure and REALLY don’t trust themselves around me. 
"Women at my workplace constantly have to put up with unwanted sexual comments, when they show disapproval it gets worse. One particular young man is pretty agressive with it, and tried to include me in his harassment of our female section leader, in front of her. When I showed disapproval he shut up, and even came back later to apologise to her. I felt good for a moment, then realised how wrong it is that it took another male to make him see he was being offensive. Since then, she doesn’t take any crap off him. "
"Was digging stuff out of bottom of trolley at work when a customer walked by and casually slapped my arse. He said ‘Y’alright?’ to which I replied ‘I was before you hit me on the backside like that.’ He mumbled that ‘ that’s what always used to happen in his workplace, and it was just joking around’ to which, for lack of anything better to say I said ‘Fine…’ and carried on which helping him find his items. Came back in today and made some inappropriate comments at my colleague about his accent and finished off with ‘At least you’re laughing. You’ve got a better sense of humour than your colleague. She hasn’t got one.’ Words cannot express how infuriated I was at that point when I heard this. "
"I’ve worked for the same company for years, and at least twice a week I’ll walk through the warehouse to get a few things in storage. There are many guys there, and some would check me out, some wouldn’t, nobody really talked to me and that was fine with me. I was average size and weight, a size 9. Then I got very thin all of a sudden, I went down to a size 2 over a period of a few months. The guys in that warehouse were suddenly talking to me, and flirting heavily. It was bizarre to me. Then I found out I had ovarian cancer and that was why I had lost all the weight. After fighting for my life in the hospital for the next 6 months, I survived (yay!) and naturally my body went back to its size 9. Two weeks back at work and I overheard in the warehouse as I walked by “hot girl is not hot anymore” and laughing. So to put it bluntly, I was only hot in their eyes when I weighed 102 pounds at 5’5. I should mention, I am 33, and these guys are in their early 20’s. Sad that so many ‘men’ in that generation expect women to be so thin to be attractive. What losers! "
"At a Christmas party I was bent down next to a table talking to a male friend, our head of department walked past and made the comment ‘while you’re down there love’ Nobody at the table laughed so he just carried on walking but looking back I wish I’d gone to HR about it – he has since left the business.

"– Casually told at a wedding – what’s the point in all this university education, we’re going to end up rolling rotis anyway – Molested when 12 and then told ‘Don’t do it even if you like it’ by someone who noticed – Helped a man solve a computer issue, all the people in the room thank the man – Groped on train stations, catcalled at on roads – casual remarks innumerable times by ex-bf – ‘girls, any mention of Gucci, and you get excited’; ‘you’re a girl, that’s why you don’t like football’ "
My boyfriend told me I should refrain of expressing my opinion on a night out with his colleagues because I might demage his career. 
"In the 1980’s I was a trainee solicitor. I was used to the system of meritocratic success in our education system so the workplace came as a shock. I was the first female lawyer my suburban firm had ever employed. I was told not to fraternise with the support staff – all women – so I followed the men to the pub on Friday lunchtimes instead. I soon realised that my presence made them uncomfortable. Most of them were Freemasons so their common ground was closed to me. Conversations started and trailed off with awkward glances in my direction. I was young and not as robust as I am now, so I assumed they didn’t like me and stopped imposing myself on them. I became completely isolated and despite efforts to improve things (including evening classes in social skills) became depressed, got a psychosomatic physical illness and resigned. I would like to think that things would not be so bad now, but as our media harden and encourage lack of respect and ‘know your place’ attitudes, I fear a woman in a similar position today would be treated even worse than I was. My advice would be, if you want to work in a male-dominated workplace, make sure there’s at least one other woman by your side. "
"Conversation is so difficult, as a woman in tech as and music. When I speak and someone responds, I (almost) always pause and allow the other person to think aloud and add to the conversation. I find that constantly, constantly, men simply speak over me in response. Not only do they speak over me, but they raise their voice. And they continue away going on and on about whatever as if they didn’t passive aggressively shut me up. Im 23, is this my life? Is this life? Why "
I’m a vocalist in clubs and pubs. I now only take gigs which my husband can attend with me because I got so sick of the rampant sexism and sexual harassment from men. They must think I’m singing to them or something and think because I’m friendly I must be “up for it”. It makes me sick to my stomach. Some men have no respect for personal space and put their arm round me while I’m singing or try and hold my hand. I’m only 5ft 3 and I can’t protest as I’m singing. In the past I’ve been threatened and harassed for turning men down. I’m self employed so there is no employment law to protect me 
was sent picture of scrotum on work email. Manager told & then said if it happens again the man involved will be disciplined and possibly fired. Good – shows that sometimes bosses WILL support women fighting #sexism in the workplace. 
"Progressive union workplace, but the boss still calls the women girls. "
"The street I work on is well-known for being a wind tunnel. Despite this, I often wear skirts and dresses, because I like how I look in them, and I like how they feel. Even with the wind, I don’t usually have problems with my skirt flipping up. One day I did, as I was crossing the street directly outside of my workplace. A guy crossing in the opposite direction said straight to me “heyyyy baby gettin’ naked in the middle of the street!” While I’m fighting with my skirt. I was so upset I had to duck into the pizza place at the end of the block and I cried for a good ten minutes. And then more when I got home. "
"Husband of highly placed woman in my workplace works in same building as a professor but is “not as high on the totem pole.” She is continuously referred to as the “Sugar Mama” because she earns more per year. I asked if the situation were reversed, would he be the “Sugar Daddy.” “No, he would be a man.” "
"I work in a bookshop and yesterday at work a mother came in with her young daughter. They were looking at sticker books and the young girl, who couldn’t be anymore than six, picked up a book about space and said she wanted that one, to which her mother replied “You cant have that one, space is for boys”. She ended up with a book about ballerinas that her mum picked. Really annoyed me to see a young girl being taught that she can’t like certain things because they aren’t for girls, especially by not only another female but by her own mother! "
"When I worked my first management job, it was in a sports store. I was consistently ignored by men who came in to shop even though I was far more knowledgeable about the products we sold. They couldn’t stand having a female know more about sports than they did. The owner, my boss, felt that I was too nice to the staff. I always treated them with respect and dignity, trained them fully and kept communication open. Apparently he didn’t like that, but the staff did. Any one of them would bend over backwards to make sure that things were done correctly and that our customers were treated like gold. I treated them as essential members of a team and never made them feel that they were below me. The owner didn’t like this approach and decided to hire another “manager” to oversee me and all of my stores. He was a sleezy, older guy who constantly made passes at all my young female staff. He made everyone uncomfortable and caused a huge amount of unrest in our company, however the owner thought he would be the one to bring about change in some way. I took several concerns to the owner of his undesirable behaviour and the fact that he refused to do any work at all. It led to problems between myself and the owner and finally to my resignation because he refused to act on the concerns my staff and I expressed. I refuse to be a part of an organization that encourages women to be treated as nothing but eye candy. We ended up with no respect, no rights and no dignity. When I left, many of my staff followed and soon after the useless, sleezy “manager” was fired for not doing his job, but not for how he treated people. Now, years later, that owner has lost all of his business and was forced to sell. What goes around, comes around! "
"Yesterday, at work: Mentioned that it was cold day(it being November and all). People in my office are literally sat around with hot water bottles and blankets. Male colleague – ‘No wonder you’re cold, look at that dress!’ I don’t wish to describe what I was wearing because I don’t want to perpetuate the myth that unsolicited comment (and by extension, harrassment) is somehow justified on the grounds of what a woman is wearing. But to add a little context – I’m a professional who knows how to dress in the workplace, and the dress in question was bought for my Grandmother’s funeral. Somewhat humiliated, I expressed my irritation to my colleague, who responded with ‘it was only a joke!’ A joke he would have made to a male colleague at my level? As if. "
"In a proffesional workplace about a year ago. A meeting starts, female member of the team is late. Male, in same leval position as the female, asks the rest of the team (male & female); “where is she? oh,i don’t remember her name. The one with big tits” "
"I work in a bar, we wear casual clothes, the girls that work there are very beautiful. The boys I work with are relatively young, aged 19 to 25 mostly, and they are very sexually open, one especially. This is stems from a previous manager who has now left, who was married however very sleazy. On my first shift he grabbed my bum when hugging me in front of my fellow male co-workers to make them laugh. It was humiliating. I have a rather curvy body. I am not stupid, obviously comments were made about my bum and it was done to impress them. That was my first shift….. One particular staff member about 21 years old is obviously rather insecure and tries to over compensate by being ultra sleazy to get laughs out of the boys. His behaviour includes such lovely quirks as asking for a kiss on the cheek on New Years Eve and then tricking kissing you on the lips even though he knows you have a boyfriend. He also makes constant comments like “If you and you’re boyfriend ever break up I wanna be your rebound! ” or “I just wanna grab that nice meaty ass of yours” On top of this he would regularly ask for hugs, as all the boys do, and I would give in to be polite, and he would grab my arse. The other boys started joining in but were far more polite about it all and it didn’t make me anywhere near as uncomfortable. This particular boy however when I would hint I didn’t like it would make a big fuss and go around bitching about me saying nasty things because he was humiliated. I started to feel hated and uncomfortable in my work place. So I tried to be friendly with the boy again and be “mature” and the “bigger person”. The the last straw came when I came into work off shift to check the roster in a pair of denim shorts and whilst I was checking the roster he came up behind me and pretended to do me doggy style from behind whilst holding my hair to get laughs out of the other boys who were watching. Something snapped and when I left work that night I left in tears furious. I wanted to punch something, mostly I wanted to punch that boy. It is absolutely humiliating, especially when you are aspiring to gain a supervisor position to be treated like an idiot. I am also a very small girl, so I partly feel this plays a role because people think I’m “cute” The boy did the same thing again to me the next day. He also made a comment about my arse and said something like “turn around I wanna see that arse in those jeans” Knowing the manager was there I said “Actually, that makes me uncomfortable, I’m putting my foot down, no more but comments” being embarrassed he replied “Well you’re getting them anyway” and to cover up his humiliation he slipped in a quick comment to the manager that her “arse looked good that day too” The comments kept coming from him and a few other male staff who had cottoned on to the trend of “lets all pay attention to —-“s arse” So i would make comments like “Guys stop, I’ve put on kilos lately and I don’t feel like the attention” big mistake because they then decided to make more comments and then I was labelled as sensitive and insecure, believe it or not, I have absolutely no insecurities about my looks, my insecurity however, is not being taken seriously in my work place in a job I have been working since I was 16. To make my point clear I tried to make it very loud and clear to my co-workers that I was a feminist and didn’t like the sleaziness in our workplace to which the response was “you are so conservative” or “why do you have to make it awkward?” I then went to the manager, to complain, everyone took it serious knowing how much shit they will get in if they don’t and hey..maybe they did care I was losing my mind a bit… The boy in the centre of it made a big deal and told everyone that all he said was that I was pretty and may have once or twice said I had a nice arse and I made a huge deal out of it because I was an insecure girl. LIE He was so imature, almost every single one of my co-workers has told me that he has said something. I can’t even be bothered trying to defend my self. Part of me is dying to stick it out in this job, get the confidence, get stronger, become a supervisor and make things right so this never happens again, the other part wants to throw in the towel and go work at a female dominated work place like Mimco or something where I can feel comfortable. I have been made to feel like an idiot, and I believe part of the reason I have lost 5 kilos recently is because of the stress from this, and the desire to lose the curves that get my the attention that makes me oh so uncomfortable. I have also been sexually assaulted in the past and even privately told the boy this hoping he would understand but no, I am left feeling like an idiot trying to work out a way to re gain my confidence "
"I work as a waitress, and it is socially understood (and to some degree accepted) that as a female waitress you will be harassed, or spoken about sexually in the workplace, either by customers or other members of staff at some point in time. About three days ago, a new pastry chef at work referred to me as “a slice of tart” after handing out leftover desserts to staff members. I do not know this man, had barely spoken to him and yet he felt that it was acceptable to demean me in this manner. I was angry but shrugged it off as, of course, I have had plenty of people treat me this way as I am a 23 year old woman. Yesterday, however, I was cleaning up the kitchen when to my complete surprise I was slapped on the bum by the same chef, who for obvious reasons I have not become any closer to. At the time I was the only woman in a room with around four other men and I felt insulted, humiliated and angry, especially as he attempted to justify his actions by saying the head chef had told him to do it whilst others were simply laughing. I was left feeling like if the head chef condones, and even encourages this behaviour, how can I expect for the behaviour of HIS and his inferiors to change? This is a futile “joke” act for a man, but an intimidating and disheartening experience for me, made more so for occurring in my place of work. "
"At my previous workplace, a female collegue and I were talking to our new male boss who had just reversed his brand new company car into a sign post. He said (not in a joking manner) “That was a girly thing for me to do”. I have never reversed my car into any object and neither had my female collegue! That was just the start – neither of us stayed at that company for much longer. "
"I am a director at a fortune 100 company. I am forty-something and have been in technology for most of my career. I have dealt with sexism at all levels, but have usually let it go because I was embarrassed to bring it up to my male leadership. I felt like it would weaken my effectiveness to my team and to my leadership. Recently, a new VP was hired as my counter part to run the engineering side of a product I have been developing with my team for the last six months. In the last month, he has talked down to me, interrupted me in meetings, and yesterday he met with my team to a meeting without my knowledge. When I confronted him about it he asked if I was saying he had to ask for permission to talk to people. I stated that meeting with my team without my knowledge and intentionally leaving me out was unacceptable. He continued to speak to me in a bullish manner and commented on how tightly wound I seemed, even though I was being clear and unemotional. This can’t continue and I have been advised to take it to the top, which is most likely going to ruin my career there. I spent all morning reading articles on sexism. I am normally easy going but I feel like I have no choice but to stand up and that I would have no self-respect if I let it go. I think about my mother, my grandmother and all of the women who have stood up so that women like me would have better opportunities. I think about how I owe it to them and to future generations of girls and women to continue the fight for our equality in the workplace. This tough truth has never hit me so hard as it has todayâ€”the sad reality of sexism in the workplace and tech. I have mixed emotionsâ€”fear and embarrassment that I have to bring it up to my male leadershipâ€”and at the same time the overwhelming responsibility I feel as a leader regardless of my sex. Wish me luck. "
"Once when I was 16 and with my dad at the doctor’s office and in line to check-in, an older man in a wheelchair got in line with his wife. It didn’t take long for the man to solicit my attention, and he then told me I could sit on his lap. My dad was standing directly next to me, and the man’s wife was directly next to him. Nobody said anything about it. When I was 18, I was walking through the parking lot of a grocery store when I passed by two older men. As I passed, one of the men said aloud to me, “Beautiful day! Don’t you just love summer?” I cheerfully affirmed as I went by. Not more than two steps away and I hear the man turn to his friend and say, “You get to see all the pretty young girls out in shorts.” I’ve lost many male friends because the feelings they had for me weren’t mutual; that’s fair enough. However, the few who have been turned down and have stayed, have persisted: -One casually called me his girlfriend and became defensive when I later reiterated that we were just friends (“Don’t think so highly of yourself”). -With another, I made a point to explain flat-out when he made obvious advances that we were just friends, and I eventually had to resort to giving him the cold shoulder because he wouldn’t respect my space. I later reinstated my friendliness with him, and over the course of two years (and all the reiteration that were were friends and he my “brother”) he constantly hovered, and he put his hands on me whenever I’d been drinking (when I’m cognizant, I’m uncomfortable in the moment; after nights I’ve been less than aware, I’ve been angry from stories I’ve been told). His boundaries were so lacking that a distant acquaintance once pulled him aside and asked him permission to speak to me. He later told our mutual friend that he thought he “still had a chance.” His behavior didn’t stop until I mentioned I was seeing someone– as is often the case (as I’ve seen in some of the stories on this site) some men do not (consciously or unconsciously) respect us enough to respect our personal decisions and what we have to say, but they will respect another man.

Talking to a male medical doctor with degrees from all sorts of prestigeous universities about perspectives for highly qualified women (i.e. me) in the workplace. He says: “… and men just find working women much less attractive!” My outraged question “Why?!” never got an answer. 
"I am the only female staff member at my workplace, my defense mechanism is to keep my head down and ignore the rampant sexism, although I probably should speak up. I’ve witnessed sales staff putting extra costs on quotes for “ugly” women to keep them out of the door, commenting on female customers’ figures as they’re walking down the long corridor out of the building, and if my office is to be believed, any woman in our male-dominated industry is either a lesbian or hasn’t got a clue. I started off in my job taking pride in my appearance, now I wear baggy trousers and a baggy jumper at all times as I grew to become scared of what they might say about me when I’m out of the room. I had to become ‘one of the lads’ to make my work day bearable. I find being called a ‘lezzer’ for wearing flat shoes and frumpy clothes is much more preferable to being the office token “dollybird”. I’ve now saved enough money and bolstered enough courage to quit, being unemployed is going to be so much easier than being bullied. There’s only so much you can laugh off. "

"I hate it when people use inappropriate terms of endearment for me in the workplace when they don’t even know me. For instance “darling”, “sweetie” etc. This would NEVER happen to a male.

"Having to deal with the only female manager of the business initiate and drive a conversation about all women being crazy. When I ask to change the topic of conversation in the office because it made me feel uncomfortable I got ‘I’m not scared, I’ll say what I like’. Forced to listen to the conversation move on to how much worse it was for men when women were in their periods. In a working environment. With no HR department. "
"A male friend of my recently challenged a women at work who called him a ‘boy’ when addressing him & rightly so. At the time, I challenged the knee jerk reaction with ‘this seems so bad to you & yet it happens to women all the time when they’re called girls & no one bats an eyelid’. To which another guy replied ‘Oh we’ve started something now’. Now I’m noticing all the time someone refers to one of us as a ‘girl’ & it’s crazy how unnoticed this goes by my male counterparts. I just showed one of the posts on this site (superhero one) to the guy who was called ‘boy’ & he was like ‘true’. I then drew his attention to something someone at work said earlier, an older man who to be honest I’ve had bad vibes from before. He waved goodbye to some colleagues by saying ‘have a good evening girls’. I told my friend about it & said if that had been him, it wouldn’t have been the same, thus drawing attention to my point – we get this all the time. He remained silent. Doesn’t make it right, but it’s good to show someone their privilege. "
"When I was 15/16, the next door neighbour had a New Year party. The brother of the neighbour (middle aged)a little drunk insisted that I slow dance with him. I didn’t want to because, well, I was a teenager and he was a fat, drunk, middle aged man. He was very persistent before grabbing me; instinctively I kneed him in the appropriate place. He approached my mother protesting that I had damaged him. Convinced that my mother would tell me off (she always did), she instead responded with “Well what did you expect? She did say she didn’t want to dance with you, you should have listened to her”. At such an influential age, when many mothers are unfortunately guilty of passing on submissive and apologetic behaviour,I’m eternally grateful that my mother responded in that way in my presence. Sadly, my mother died when I was 19 but the “she did say no” sentiment has empowered me everyday since. When I hear sexist comments from men, I openly challenge them without embarrassment. Where I notice a lack of female representation in the workplace, I loudly question why. It genuinely angers me when other women don’t. "
In the next door training room a male colleague was using a quiz to make sure everyone understood what they needed to know. The mood was light hearted but then I heard him very clearly describe a group of women in the room as ‘You cheating wenches’. This is not a joke … it is how men in my workplace (a public sector service) behave on a routine basis. 
not so long ago i was walking to my workplace (i had to as there where no early busses on a sunday) and three men in a van started whistling. i ignored them and walked on only for them to call after me that if i didn’t come to them they would come to me. they said they would rape and then kill me. 
"A guy from work said that he could tell me anything about his bachelor party because I think and behave like a man. He only said that because of a conversation we had in the same week about getting married, when I said I didn’t want to. He called me selfish and said it was every woman’s dream, and probably in a few years I’d feel alone and regret about my personal decision about marriage. The same guy told me that I was much prettier than my friends and didn’t understand why I wasn’t flattered, because this is everything a woman wants to hear anytime (even if it’s in your workplace) of her existence. A few months later when he discovered I was a feminist, he asked me why didn’t I show my boobs on the streets, like all feminists do? "
"As stated I worked at nightclub in Derby with a reputation. I wore trouser and polo shirt as uniform. One evening I was approached by a black car, mistaken simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong hour as a prostitute. Another evening I realised I was being followed home I was within two streets of my own when I realised I could not let this individual find out where I lived. I let the individual catch up with me. He was lost and couldn’t find a hotel I was told. I promptly told him to turn back round and return to the city. He tried to touch me on more than once and each time I told him, as loud as possible in the highly populated terrace streets not too. I repeated for him to turn round regardless of being asked if he could stay the night. I recall being followed another evening to this address because I remember a fearful voicemail to my housemate to please, please come meet me. I quit my job. It didn’t make me feel any safer, I was stalked in broad daylight instead. Once by a man opening a coffee shop. This time it was he who caught u with me fairly quickly. I was stupid and afraid to upset him so I carried on a discourse, involving replying that I was nervous because its not everyday a man follows you home only to be met with that for someone as pretty me it ought to be. (Please note that I use his words) Again this got within a street or two of my address when I was to uncomfortable to allow him to know where I lived. A discourse ensued and eventually he left me on the false promise that I would visit him in his workplace. (I had tried and failed at the old false phone number trick) I changed my route to university. "
"Headline from an article written by a female journalist: “Girls, I learnt to deal with the gropers, so must you”. The article appeared in The Times today (Sunday 14th Oct). She says “relations between men and women at work have become sexually awkward and embarrassing in a new way; men are frightened of doing the wrong thing”. Erm….is that not a good thing? Shouldn’t everyone be frightened of doing the wrong thing? According to this journalist, now that women are speaking out and seeking redress for being groped in the workplace, men are now a bit embarrassed and frightened. Surely the only men who should be frightened are the ones who think sexually harrassing female colleagues is acceptable. I hope they are very frightened indeed! "

"Thank you for this site. I worked at a world-wide shipping company (the one with brown trucks) and had to put up with sexist bullshit from day one, and the attitude was, “If you are working in a male dominated space you have to deal with it.” I did, because wrongly I thought to complain would make me out to be the ‘Whiny Bitch.’ I was rubbed up against by my supervisor, in the process of looking at my load on the trucks, and had to hear sexist jokes and conversation, because I had chosen to work in a male dominated job. Well, those are the jobs where the money is to be made. I was physically strong, and that upset some of the men, so my workload was increased almost as punishment. (“So you think you can do this? Here – have more work.”) My current job is in security, and there’s a lot of subtle sexism, even though the workforce is 50/50 male and female. There was a mess on the floor, and one of my supervisors actually tried to hand me the vacuum cleaner, as if I was the one to do the cleaning. Hey, you’ve already got it, you vacuum the mess up, but no – it’s because that’s ‘women’s work.’ The “Smile!” order – that thing. I got one while I was at a position at my workplace that I couldn’t leave. I asked the man if he told men to smile, and he said he told ‘everyone’ to smile. Liar. If you want to see a smile so bad, go and smile in the mirror. "

"I read in the Guardian today (10 October 2012) that older women face less sexual harrassment and assault than younger women at the workplace. Unfortunately this is not the case with myself. At the age of 58 (last year) I was molested at the University where I work as an academic by a man whom I had known for over 17 years. He was someone I admired and we had a very good working relationship. I had gone to his office to get his advice regarding a course and as we were about to leave to get a coffee he told me to turn around and look out the window. This I did, expecting him to point out something of interest outside but instead he grabbed my breasts and proceeded to molest me for quite some time. I tried my best to struggle free, even trying to bend his fingers back but nothing seemed to work. When he eventually let me go he then proceeded to launch into a verbal tirade which I don’t want to repeat. It took me two months before I could tell my husband (I’ve been married for over 30 years) because I felt so deeply ashamed. I eventually told my departmental head and he then contacted Human Resources. Then a whole new nightmare started up with the academic even threatening to bring out disciplinary procedures against me for accusing him of indecent assault. However, to cut a long story short I was believed by the Deputy Provost who banned him from my part of the campus. I have since discovered that he indecently assaulted a PhD student of his who then left the university as a direct result. The sting in the tail is that this academic’s wife is now a research fellow in my department so I spend my Mondays (the day that she is in) creeping around, avoiding her. I feel very depressed that this man was not given the sack but as he is a Professor he is obviously of more worth than me, a humble Senior Lecturer. As a result of the assault I have stopped my research because I have developed writer’s block. I just don’t seem to have the energy, drive or concentration required to sit down and write. I can’t wait to retire and feel near to tears a lot of the time. "
"I work in the design industry, and my first 2 design jobs where in heavily male dominated workplaces.. one place had 4/15 women, the other 4/50. Having worked previously in catering thru uni, I was completely shocked by the treatment of the women in the ‘real’ workplace. Copies of The Sun, everyday, left open at page three at the ‘communal’ lunch table, and a tirade of ‘do you tits look like that’ etc when we sat down to eat / continual comments about periods and our inability to handle stress in the workplace. One women was sacked because she couldnt work overtime, having to pick up her son instead. All 3 of the women who i worked with there suffered depression, I left after a year. The second job was worse – I was the youngest there – at 28. Constant comments about tits / sex / the place of women in this world. I know this is off topic, but the racial hatred and closed minded attitude towards anything was sickening – it seemed to me, that racist and sexist comments where never too far from each other, and i had to leave my desk on many occasions, due to shock and disgust. It was never said outright, but it was suggested on many occasions, that I would never have a permanent job at that company due to my gender. The other women where supportive, but submissive – any support was whispered in the toilets and passed with an attitude of ‘its just how it is here’. I was made to feel childish, stuck up, uptight and frigid, many nights i would come home in tears or rages, gob-smacked at the attitude of the workforce there – I left after 8 months – I was told there was no job for me anymore. I felt, throughout all this, that it was always me and my inability to ‘handle a joke’. I felt like I had been softened by Uni, open-minded upbringing and a ideology that men and women where equal.. Its a very real and sad truth i face in my career – it will always be male dominated. I will never be able to balance my job and having a family without sacrifice. and I will be constantly held down due to my gender, even victimised because of it. "
"I was told a rape joke at work a couple of weeks ago by a male colleague. When I told him that rape jokes weren’t funny, his response was to say to another colleague “Did you hear what N said? She says rape jokes aren’t funny.” I felt on one hand that I shouldn’t have had to justify that comment, but conflictingly I felt that I really wanted to, to see if they might change their opinions. However I didn’t feel that I could do so and be taken seriously, so said nothing. Today the second man told another rape joke to myself and another female colleague, introducing it with the sentence “N won’t find this one funny.” This time I struck up a conversation with him about the possible problems with normalising rape through humour, and the effect that could have on people who heard. For him, it was clearly an issue of the boundaries of comedy, and he quoted a lot of different famous comedians on the role of shocking and offensive jokes. The theoretical and abstract debate was interesting, but he never engaged with my suggestion that he could have been making that joke to someone who would find it not so much offensive, as really disturbing, belittling and ridiculing an experience they might have had of sexual assault. I found it difficult to say that directly, and I think our (my) reluctance to talk about rape openly makes it easier for even intelligent people like him to distance themselves from the effect they have, seeing rape jokes abstractly, but not seeing their direct and practical effects. Even recognising this, I think I would struggle to discuss rape with him more frankly, seeing as our discussion was in a public workplace, even though that was a space he felt comfortable to joke about rape in.

"I worked for a well-known British clothing and food company in North America for three years in the 1980s. All of the senior management were British expats. I was employed in a management position directly out of university. This was my first ‘proper job’. During my time at the company I was bombarded with sexual comments. Two of the most memorable comments made to me over the years include; “Your head lights are on,” this meant that the outline of my nipples could be seen through my shirt. “lots of guys here would like to fuck you”. I was shocked by these comments. I was 24 years old. Although I had worked at part-time jobs since I was 16, I had never experienced sexual harassment. I was totally unprepared for such unprofessional behaviour in the workplace. I went to talk with my parents who were equally shocked. They suggested I speak with HR. I took their advice and spoke with the very kind HR Manager, whose reaction was, “I know, it’s disgusting you could do much better in a different company”. I’m sure she thought she was being supportive. I decided to talk with my Manager. His words to me were shockingly, “Oh darling just get drunk and get laid”. I left the company soon after without having work to go to but I just couldn’t face the innuendo. I documented my experiences and sent a letter to the company’s head office in London. I never got a reply. "
"Now 60, I have been irked all my adult life by the persistent use of the term “girl” to describe adult females. If the diminutive “girl” is not deployed, then people usually resort to the equally judgemental “lady”, an embellished form which suggests that is is somehow shameful to be a mere woman. Why are people so scared of the word “woman”. I don’t notice people avoiding use of the word “man”. It reveals much about the status of women in society, snd the ways in which they are stigmatised and taken less seriously than men. Linked with this is the exclusion of women through the use of the term “you guys” prevalent in the workplace and throughout the media. The term “guys” is a false generic, despite claims to the contrary. “You guys” excludes women in the same way that “the man in the street” or “History of Man” writes out the part played by women in our world, in our history. Is it so very difficult to substitute the more accurate “person” or “human” for “man”? Is it so hard to use the inclusive term “you” or “you all” in place of “you guys”? When will women be treated as fully human? "
"A man in my office informed me that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote as our vote are essntially worthless. He also then went on to inform me that women being ‘allowed’ to enter the workplace had devalued jobs for me. My complaint about this (and several other events) took over 3 months to process, and I wasnt even informed of the outcome at the end of it. It turns out that attending a diversity course was punishment enough, even though we had all completed one 3 months previously. I have to work 3 feet from this man and every day listen to the poison that he spews. I have been denyed a request to relocate. "
"I am 30 years old and I work at an engineering firm staffed with mostly men. After my first week at the office, I showed up to work on Monday and my boss asked me, “Did you get into any trouble over the weekend?” I was taken aback and told him, “No, I’m married and boring and don’t do anything like that,” to which he responded, “I don’t believe that for a second.” It may have been an off-hand remark on his part, but it infuriated me nonetheless. What exactly does he mean by “get into trouble”? I am a grown woman, my personal life is my business, and trying to get me to give some kind of “naughty” confession is, frankly, perverted and disgusting. I gave him the cold shoulder for a week or so, giving minimal answers, avoiding eye contact, etc. I even considered going back to the Staffing Agency that placed me there and finding something else. He definitely got the sense that I wasn’t happy with him, and eventually backed off on asking about my personal life. I just keep my answers to personal questions of any sort from the male staff (all but one or two of whom are very respectful) to a minimum, and they don’t pry. I should have just told him that I found the wording of his question a little inappropriate rather than let my behavior display my displeasure, but once the moment passed I didn’t know how to bring it up without sounding like I was “making a big deal out of nothing.” I think that as women we’re often taught to be agreeable and non-confrontational, particularly in the workplace, so one strategy I employ is to simply not smile or chuckle at a comment that I find offensive. Often I think we laugh along as a reflex, because we don’t know what else to do or the surprise leads us to simply laugh or smile as a result of the stress of the moment. A small act like not going along and laughing at an offensive joke, for example, can be a way to show that you aren’t conceding to being disrespected without having to necessarily give a speech about equality. However, for more serious offenses or for repeat behavior, further action is, of course, necessary. "
"Recently a guy who works a couple of floors above who I’d seen only once or twice before came back from a characteristically long boozy lunch and grabbed hold of me from behind while I was sitting at my desk. His boss had commented previously when I was assembling a kneeling chair (for a back problem) that he didn’t think sex toys were allowed in the workplace. It happened in the middle of a three month probationary period and at a particularly stressful time for me as we were buying our first home. Since being confronted with his behaviour by my manager he has resorted to bullying tactics, which I now have to deal with too. I’ve been looking for another job but easier said than done at the moment – before this job came along I was out of work for 7 months. I have to stay becuase I now have a mortgage but every day I daydream about my last day here! I am a PA/Exec Asst to two companies, and the only woman in a building where there are 9 men. "

Im too scared to tell them to stop and too scared i’ll be treated badly at the workplace if I tell them to stop. I hate fucking men, with a passion.

"I worked at a starbucks that followed the “just say yes” policy to the detriment of it’s baristas. My female manager warned me to never get to friendly with one guy- he followed one girl home in his car after she refused a ride and she transferred to another store. Apparently he was always trying to hug the employees, trying to add them on facebook, asking repeatedly for phone numbers and where they lived. She laughed like it was funny- I was horrified. There were lots of creepy regulars, ones who asked if you had a boyfriend, asked if you thought they were attractive, would give unwanted and inappropriate compliments. One night I was working with a male manager who was quite nice but a little spineless. One of the more aggressive regulars was talking about my uniform and reached forward and touched my breast. I told him that if he touched me again I would call the police, and he freaked out, telling me to do it, telling my manager to get the security tapes. I didn’t back down and got in his face, telling him I would and that I would not be touched that way and that I would call the police on him, and that the security tapes would back me up on what happened. My manager said to go in the back room while he dealt with the customer, who was getting more and more agressive, and partially out of anger and aggression I burst into tears, making me not want to go back out. The other guy on shift came back and tried to calm me down, saying he wouldn’t let the customer touch me again. The manager (male) calmed the customer down by saying I was just tired and over-reacting and gave him free drink coupons to encourage him to come back. I guess I scared the guy off because he never came in on the evening shift while I worked there again. The male manager did try to comfort me, but he didn’t take me seriously- it was harmless flirtation! I should have been complimented! I was too angry and exhausted to fight back, so I went home early. I needed the job, so I came back for my next shift a few days later and here’s where things get really messed up- nearly the entire staff turned against me (with a few exceptions) and said that I was lying and over-reacting- our customers were just friendly! He didn’t mean any harm. They hadn’t been there or seen it, and I am sure they heard the side of the story where I was being difficult. I wanted to report it to the district manager. I guess they didn’t like that I was causing trouble or making the store look bad or something. I quit, but I still get angry to the point of shaking. I couldn’t even go in to pick up my tips because I knew I would lose it. I’ve told the story to people who have said I should sue starbucks, but it’s been so long since it happened I wouldn’t have much of anything to go on. I regret not doing it right when it happened, even if only to prevent this from happening again (and trust me, it is.) A policy of just saying yes to everything the customer wants is not ok. Not when it intervenes in your ability to defend yourself and your body. Starbucks brainwashes their workers to cater to the customers every whim. It’s a fucked up policy that often results in sexual harassment, and though my story isn’t “everyday” as such, it’s not unique to that workplace and is far more commonplace than it should be. "
"The Telegraph newspaper’s casual sexism – their constant “women can’t have it all” meme, quote mining from Christine Laguarde , implying that men can and should. They’ve played this card before with a deliberate misquote from Emma Thompson who once said that parents couldn’t have it all – which the Telegraph changed to “women” . Plus a crap “survey” that asserts relationships last when the wife does all the housework. Not in my experience they don’t. Drip drip drip to get us out of the workplace… "

"My husband, who is normally quite feminist in his views, made an off the cuff comment after we were out for dinner that he didn’t understand why the young waitresses were rude when a middle aged man hits on them. I pointed out that they were waitresses and it isn’t their job to stroke male egos. If the advances are unwelcome then why should they worry about being rude? He pushed it a bit more which prompted me to point out that the men were being rude first by making sexual advances to women at their workplace, women who in many cases are unable to get away from the men, either because they’re serving them or because they are trapped behind a bar. My husband got quiet, the kind of quiet where I know he just doesn’t want to talk about something anymore. It hit me then that even the most enlightened seeming men have stereotypes they aren’t even aware of that women somehow owe respect to men, even as those men are disrespecting them. "
"I got a new job in a ski cabin in the mountains and on the first day, when the whole team sat down to eat lunch (everyone had sausage with sauerkraut) I said something like ‘yay, food!’ when I saw what we were eating and a colleague said “so you’re into big sausages, huh!’ in a sleazy way. I rolled my eyes and said ‘sexual harassment at a workplace!’. He apologized and said he really didn’t want it to sound like THAT. And yet I feel super uncomfortable around this colleague now and I cut the sausage into tiny pieces because I didn’t want it to look ‘sexual’ while eating, even though I never eat sausages like that. And I also feel like I shouldn’t be wearing that cute skirt I recently bought to work, to avoid any comments from him. If he says anything again I know I would lecture him on how he shouldn’t be treating women like that, but I also don’t want another colleague (who is cute) to hear this, because that would make me look like I don’t like a little flirting or can’t take a joke. I wonder if men understand that a stupid sexist comment is more than just a stupid comment, it intimidates quite a lot. "
"Why is it assumed the title Ms is only used by divorced women? It was introduced to replace Miss and Mrs in order that a woman’s marital status was not shown by her title, in the same way that Mr is used by ALL men. Instead, like many other things which were supposed to help level the playing field, it has just made the situation worse. Also when phoning the council some years ago (when married) to ask that records be amended to show me as the householder for Council Tax purposes as I owned the house, when paperwork was sent in my then husband’s name, (they had been told this) I was asked by the woman on the other end of the phone if it really mattered! Also I am now working in an office where men disappear on a friday afternoon to play golf. This happened in a previous workplace, also men invited to football matches on the company etc, etc. "
Just read the comments on Telegraph under any piece discussing women in the workplace – vicious . 
"I work as a successful consultant surgeon but have had to put up with sexism throughout my career. Here are some examples: 1. when I got pregnant one of my bosses remarked to a colleague “are her tits even bigger now?” 2. when asking a senior colleague advice in the intensive care unit about a patient was told to “stop pointing those things at me” (ie. my breasts) whilst talking to him. I was needless to say standing normally in normal modest clothing whilst speaking. 3. Once I finally got to be a consultant one of my colleagues suggested I should give up and be a housewife instead. 4. Am repeatedly told that I am too young to consider entering senior NHS management despite the fact I am older than most of my male peers who take on such roles. 5. Was told by one boss when I was pregnant with my first child that being a parent and a consultant surgeon would be too much for me and that I would never cope. Not advice ever given to my male colleagues. Luckily advice I ignored. 6. The admission documents and regulations to the Royal College of Surgeons have only just been changed to alter the terminology from “Mr”, “he” etc to reflect that females may be surgeons. 7. Have had to force a change in recruitment to clinical director roles in my hospital from a voting system to one of open interview and competative appointment so that these roles are not a popularity contest voted for by a predominantly male workforce. Needless to say after forcing such a change the job I applied for went to my less well-qualified male colleague. 8. Had to endure being housed with sex pests in hospital accommodation during medical school – one co-habiter used to enter my room and start massaging my shoulders whilst making suggestive comments. Another used to shower with the bathroom door open whilst soaping a prominent erection. Despite all of this enjoy my job and mostly its great. The glass ceiling may be a reality in my field but I keep trying to smash it whilst retaining my sense of humour. It is great to be able to anonymously write about some of the instances of sexism I have encountered to show that it is not all hunky dory in the workplace. Raising these concerns through offical channels at work would have been career suicide and it is great that this website allows an acknowledgement that these problems are still faced by many women in the workplace.

"I am an Environmental Engineer working in a global engineering firm. I have 5 years experience in the workforce and part of my job involves coordinating an onsite team of surveyors, drillers and plant operators onsite to assess underlying ground conditions. In these situations I am the lead engineer, I wear high vis, boots and a hard hat exactly the same as the male staff. However, my team leader and then boss has made multiple ‘jokes’ in front of other colleagues about how the Site I’m working on is close to a shopping mall, or did I get time to go shopping while I was ‘out of the office’. When I raised a separate incident about potential sexual harassment that I had witnessed between a director and one of my female colleagues. I was told by the same boss that he had noticed that behaviour before from the director and he was thinking of telling the female staff in our team that they should make sure they are not alone with him. Instead of raising this as an issue, he compared the incident to another sexual assault situation that had occurred at his last work which he believe was worse, and that since that didn’t get reported, this probably wasn’t that bad. I confronted my boss on the situation and made it clear that women shouldn’t have to change their perfectly normal and professional behaviour to protect themselves from sexism within the workplace.

"a boy walking towards me stopped me to ask the time, which I gave him and when I walked off in the opposite direction he started walking quickly after me, I started running so he ran to catch up and grabbed hold of my arm, so I screamed at him to get off, and he said “don’t you want to come and do it”. I did report it to the police and they thanked me but it seemed minor, scared the hell out of me though. I was crying by the time I got home. I couldn’t tell if the boy had learning difficulties or if he just didn’t know it was bad to run after girls when its dark and they are on their own. He didn’t seem to realise how terrifying he was. Man pushed himself up against me on the bus I thought it was more crowded than it was and didn’t notice until I saw the look on a woman’s face further up. I think he might have been smelling my hair. This man definitely had learning difficulties which doesn’t excuse it but I did feel sorry for him because maybe that’s the closest he gets to a woman in his normal life. sad really. Kerb crawled walking home at 4am, primarily because I was wearing a fur coat and shorts as far as I could tell. He drove off when he saw the look of dawning realisation and horror on my face Arse grabbed in a nightclub. I asked the bouncers to throw him out which they did and then I walked past him puking his guts up several hours later. Maybe he was too drunk to realise what he had done Have been told by one colleague that Women aren’t any good with computers (I work as a web developer). When I raised my eyebrow at his comment he explained that “Obviously he didn’t mean me”. So in his mind it’s only other women who can’t transcend their tiny enfeebled brains to formulate basic logic instructions. He didn’t even apologise. I am too well mannered to give someone a screaming row in the middle of the workplace so I kept it to myself. This is the second time in my career I have come across this assumption. Thankfully the last time was over 10 years ago. walking home from the gym a man said something sexually provocative, I don’t remember, some kind of come on. I’ve learnt the safest thing to do in this situation is pretend you haven’t heard so I walked on. This angered him so he cycled after me, overtook and pulled his bike up in front of me. I stopped, frightened by this point and he said “I wouldn’t want to fuck you anyway” and then he cycled off. I was too scared to walk home even though it was only ten minutes away because I realised I was vulnerable and if he came after me again I would be in a quieter street so I had to cross over the road and wait at the bus stop infront of where his friends were all stood whilst he glared at me. I felt really humiliated and angry that he had stopped me from doing what I had wanted which was walk home and enjoy the sunny evening but also too scared to brave it and figured I would be safer on the bus around lots of people Have had the following shouted at me whilst cycling on my own by men leaning out of car windows: I want to lick your cunt, I want to see your pink pussy. What makes me angry about this is there is no way to reply, or retaliate. Ocassionally I have fleeting fantasies about smashing their wing mirrors with my bike locks but its hard to tell if they would become violent and obviously being the weaker party I can’t defend myself if the situation escalated Whilst complaining online at being ogled in my running gear when I’m trying to exercise a friend told me that it was our fault we are objectified because if women were more sexually agressive then men wouldn’t have to be. I am still puzzling through this one. Can’t everyone just be less sexually aggressive? Why does it have to be a competition? "
"Four years ago, I was working as a “valeter” for a BMW Dealer in a small town in county Wexford. I had been working for them for four months when a manager started to call me “honey”. As I found it rather inappropriate in a work place, I asked him to call me by my name. Soon, a very arrogant, stuck-up person (another manager) showed up, and started to explain that here, in this country ladies are called like “Hon”, “Sweetheart” or whatever men want to call them, so he started to call me “Darling”. From that day on, this manager visited me regularly at work until he managed to got me to understand that it would have been much better for me to become his “Friend with benefits”, if I had wanted to keep my -otherwise- underpaid and hard physical job. I relied on this income as I was married and had a family, however, he (or the company who was backing him in his filthy blackmailing, and was covering his acts in every possible way) was never interested in my being married. They never accepted this as an excuse for not being a “Friend with benefits” of anyone. I just wanted to work, earn money and spend it on my family. I did not want any trouble. They were extremely happy with my work, so I calmed down a bit when a 20-year-old girl arrived to the company (I was 39) to participate in a 9-month Internship as a receptionist, and this manager had found another amusement for himself in the person of that girl. (Literally, they spent the whole day together, the company supplied them with enough time, car and fuel to travel to the next town where the girl lived so that they could have sex instead of being at work. I was happy with that because I thought, at least, I would be left alone.) The only thing I was not happy with was that when this girl went on holiday this manager came and started the harassment over again as he needed someone for sex. As I could observe it, he was literally “bathing” in the fame that he was a “fashionable womanizer” who could bother anyone unpunished as he was completely a beneficiary of nepotism at the company I worked for. Being famous for having more than one “Friend with benefits” simultaneously was his real enjoyment, rather than having sex with them. So, he often came and pretended in front of my colleagues that I was one of his “Friends with benefits”. I was warned for the second time that it was better not to fall out with that manager, so to save my job AND ONLY TO SAVE MY JOB!!! I slept with him for the second time. When his girlfriend returned from holiday, she was not even jealous of me when she heard the story of how his boyfriend had compensated himself when she was gone – which showed me the fact that how high expectations she might have had regarding being the girlfriend of an accomplished 40-year-old businessman. Probably, a job or a marriage had been promised to her. To make this story short, I could not take the harassment and humiliation anymore as he and the whole company objectified me as his spare sex-toy, so I quit my job. The most interesting part of it is that my reputation has been ruined, I could not get a job ever since I left them. No one will give me job here because nobody wants to piss them off by employing me. I am the one who lives with “stigma”, my life is broken, and I needed 4 years to recover and tell this story. I think this is some “form ” of rape when someone is blackmailed with their job. And the person, that committed it on me, had spent two years stalking me afterwards. I did not do anything wrong except I did not report his threatening messages like ” (I quote)…believe me you don`t want to fuck with me, or you will be sorry!…” to police at all. Thank you for reading my story, and …LADIES, LEARN YOUR LESSON OF IT!!! "

I have read all the commentary on women in the workplace after they have children and eventually it didn’t/doesn’t bother me because I want a family and children and if it has to be one or the other then I can live with sacrificing work. I have a young baby now and weirdly I have just been offered the job I want on my own terms with a huge salary increase. This isn’t how it is meant to be I keep saying to myself. This is just luck that will run out soonâ€¦as soon as I have a 2nd baby. It’s sad that all through my 20s I knew I was getting closer to the point where my career would start to go in reverse and also that underlying everything and in the face of success at the same time as motherhood I still know that at some point having babies will affect job prospects majorly. Maybe I’m a lucky one, maybe not. It’s not a very positive story or feeling for young women, but maybe this is proof it isn’t all bad news. I have had many conversations where I accept the status quo and that at some point soon I’ll want to have children and it will all go down the toilet (work stuff, all I worked for) but I won’t do that again. I’m going to be positive when speaking to other women! "

"I’m a freshman in high school and I’m used to being cat called on a weekly basis. Whether it’s going to the grocery store with my mom or walking down my road to simply get in some exercise and enjoy nature, these things will happen more often than not. It doesn’t even have to be a whistle or vulgar and rude language thrown at me, it can easily just be stares up and down and a creepy smile given. Men will follow me around the grocery store as if I don’t notice, but I always do, and I’ve become more aware over time. One time, a man even followed my mom and I out into the parking lot, and I kept track of him the whole time, because I was paranoid he might do something. He lost track of where we were, but when he found us, he got in his van and he drove around the parking lot in order to get to the exit that was closest to us. Luckily, nothing happened, he didn’t do anything, but he stared the entire time, and I think if I hadn’t noticed him at all, something would have happened. I’ve stopped going on walks simply because of cars slowly pulling up next to me and men yelling inappropriate things at me out their window, etc.. Over the summer, I remember, I got my hair and eyebrows done at a salon and just down the street from that salon was the place where my mom worked, so she suggested and I figured I would walk down to her workplace instead of her having to pick me up. Well, on my walk, there was a man sitting in a chair in his garage, a drink in his hand. As I walked by this man, he whistled at me. I proceeded to walk faster to get out of this mans sight simply because of the discomfort I was feeling at this point, and this man got up out of his chair and he watched me until I got to my destination. I always panic when things like this happen and the fact that I was alone and didn’t know exactly where I was going made it a lot worse. The Friday after Thanksgiving I was at the mall, as most people are on Black Friday, waiting in line at a store. Three (redacted by moderator) guys were near checkout, shopping, and the whole time I spent in that line they were giving me creepy smiles and looks up and down, and they were talking back and forth and laughing amongst each other, no doubt they were talking about me in a sexual manner. They were all making complete eye contact with me, to let me know that they were talking about me, and one of them even winked at me, which made it all the more clear that they were being inappropriate. There are many, many, many other stories I could tell, but this is long as is. Keeping in mind the fact that I am only 14 years of age, I still experience men of almost all age groups acting like this towards me, and it’s so uncalled for, disturbing and unfair to me. I absolutely despise it. "
"I sent an email to Man 1 with a question about something I was organising with Man 2. I cc’d Man 2 and explained we were organising the event together. Man 1 replied, answering the question and giving some information about the context that was totally not needed, as it was the reason I was emailing him. Despite the fact that I had emailed Man 1, the reply was set out in this format: “Man 2, ” “Woman, ” I wouldn’t be upset by providing the information but the fact that he specifically addressed it to me, while giving the useless information to my male colleague has really upset me. Coincidentally, I knew the information as I’ve been in the organisation for almost 3 years. Male 2 has been in a few months and may not have found it out yet. "
From the ages of 16-18 I worked in a cafe in my home town. The guy who came with our deliveries used to make me feel quite uncomfortable and used to flirt with the young staff (all around my age). He was in his 50’s and used to say ‘if I was only 30 years younger’ 
"So, I’m married to a farmer- which makes me a ‘farmers wife.’ I have a degree in agriculture and successfully ran my own farm for 6 years but no matter. I can handle all of the sexism sent my way- alot! but i have just had a daughter- and from day 1 of her being born, this perfect little baby all i hear is ‘you’ll need to have another one then, a boy to take over the farm’ or ‘oh poor you my sister had daughters too’ I AM A GIRL so how is this acceptable to say to a girl? and its not just from men but other women too. Essentially my daughter is not good enough… "

"Iâ€™ve worked in hospitality for about ten years, various bars and restaurants in various locations all around the world, classy places, dirty places, restaurants, dive bars, cocktail lounges, theme bars, cruise boats the works. I used to love the job, the hours were great for my lifestyle, the money was alright, tips always help and as I had masses of hospitality experience I could always be pretty certain of walking into a short term job wherever I went which is very important to me in my nomadic lifestyle. But then â€“ and I honestly cant remember when I first noticed it but as soon as I did it began to grate on my nerves, the fact that almost every man who walked into my bar would call me â€˜Luvâ€™. Simple enough perhaps, a small innocuous word but as soon as I noticed that one there were others, â€˜pint please babeâ€™, â€˜cheers darlinâ€™, â€˜keep the change Sweetheartâ€™, â€˜smile Loveâ€™. It made my skin crawl, who the hell were these people to be calling me these words? These patronising little pet names that I wouldnâ€™t want my friends calling me let alone these complete strangers who think they can be so disrespectful to me just because Iâ€™m female, just because I work behind a bar. 80% of the male customers who would speak to me like this and I would stiffen when I saw guys coming up to the bar. Iâ€™d tense, waiting for one of those disparaging names to be thrown at me during the transaction. I hated it. Absolutely hated it with every fibre of my being but woe betide me if I tried to speak out about it, if I said in my politest most customer friendly tone â€?could you please not call me that?â€? I was met with puzzled, bewildered, hurt faces, â€œcall you what luv?â€? â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with darling? I was just being friendly.â€? The guy who called me â€˜beautifulâ€™ got told exactly where he could shove his pint and then spent an hour sat at my bar explaining how it wasnâ€™t his fault that I was beautiful and he was just expressing his appreciation of it. That it â€œwasnâ€™t sexist because it was trueâ€?. He told anyone whoâ€™d listen that I should have been flattered and grateful and here I was shouting at him for no reason. Others just got angry, slipped straight from â€˜sweetheartâ€™ to â€˜bitchâ€™ in a second, some complained to my manager, some laughed and told me to lighten up. So I stopped speaking up I grit my teeth and then I would rant to my friends instead. Then here was the surprise, my friends didnâ€™t agree with me, they â€œdidnâ€™t think it was a problemâ€? told me I was â€œover reactingâ€? that I â€œshouldnâ€™t take it so seriously, they didnâ€™t mean anything by itâ€? . Some agreed with me (always barstaff, always women) and when they did they always felt as strongly as I did but most thought I was being humourless and hostile and the men thought it wasnâ€™t a problem at all in fact most of them happily told me that they do it themselves when they go into a bar, they â€œalways call the barmaid luv, or babe, they donâ€™t mind, its just youâ€?. And some told me it was just the same as customers calling the male staff â€˜mateâ€™ which it is not, not at all the same, mate implies equality and friendship and comradery whereas babe and darling and sweetheart are belittling and imply no such thing. So I stopped ranting to my friends and eventually I knew I had to get out of the industry before I seriously lost my shit with a customer and got myself fired. It was my main reason for quitting bar work, a job I used to love and which suited my lifestyle perfectly it had been sullied and turned in to a tortuous experience by men who think its ok to talk down to anyone female. I know that Iâ€™m ranting here and I know that in the grand scheme of things itâ€™s not a tragedy but I also know that this is why this site is here for people to turn up these stories so that the world can see the inherent sexism in our every day lives. Ok this experience didnâ€™t ruin my life but it pissed me the hell off and made my work life miserable for years. Especially the fact that I had no outlet in which complain or anyone to tell me that I wasnâ€™t going crazy that it wasnâ€™t just me, that I was right and itâ€™s not ok for people to insult me in my workplace just because Iâ€™m female. And Iâ€™m really glad that this site is here so that I can finally get this out there, in a forum that wont tell me that Iâ€™m overreacting and I can finally have my anger heard, maybe even listened to.

"Whilst working on fruit packing company during my time at university I was frequently subjected to unacceptable workplace antics. It finally came to a head when a fellow make employer walked up to me and started rubbing himself up against me. I threatened to take it to management and was told in no uncertain terms that he would laugh it off because “he don’t listen to that sort oÂ´girl stuff” and if I didn’t like it I could find employment elsewhere. I found out later, to my cost, that the manager of the facility did in fact see no issue with sexual harassment in the workplace and laughed openly at my complaint. To this day I am angry with myself for simply walking and not returning, and not taking the issue further. "
"Hand over at my workplace from my female manager: “You said they were sending a technician, but they just sent a woman. You just expect a man don’t you?

"In English, you only have 1 pronoun to address people: ‘you’. In France, we have 2. You can use ‘tu’ when you’re familiar with the person (I use it with my friends, family and my colleagues). When you don’t know the person, conventions (and politeness) require that you use ‘vous’. Again, conventions require that you keep on using ‘vous’ unless you are invited by the other person to use ‘tu’. For my work, I often have to meet other persons and I work with them for several weeks. Very often, women will use ‘vous’ till the end whereas men will use ‘tu’ very quickly without even asking my permission. The fact that I look very young does not help but should not be an invitation to familiarity. Similarly, we are 3 girls and 3 guys in the open space. When we have our partners coming over, they will invariably shake hands with the guys but kiss the girls on the cheeks. Oh, I should mention that we have this stupid thing in France: we kiss everyone. The cheek kissing rule in the workplace is a bit complicated and changes from one office to the other but generally when you are a woman you are expected to kiss on the cheeks your colleagues (male and female) when you arrive in the morning. Cheek kissing is allowed here because you see your colleagues on an every day basis which implies some levels of familiarity. That is what we do in my office because we are all between 25 and 27 yo, and we get on well, so… When you are a man, you usually kiss your female colleagues and shake hands with the other men. Sometimes, partners or clients we work with occasionally come to the office. Because I don’t see them everyday, I’d rather shake hands with them. But they take for granted that they can kiss you on the cheeks because you’re a girl. I don’t know if I was very clear in my explanation, this is so culturally French… "
"I’m so pissed off. A new guy started at work last week. Made it clear he was keen, but polite and friendly with it. We met for breakfast at the weejend but both had places to go. By Monday I’d had three emails: when are we meeting up, are you free tonight etc. He’s not really my type and I’m really busy at work, so I said let’s make it at the weekend for a colleague’s leaving do. Again, photos, emails, texts, not threatening but insistent when we’re both virtual strangers. I missed his messages today so texted that we’d meet tonight for drinks as per arranged. Doesn’t turn up and colleagues are looking at me as the organiser of the event . I phone him: grumpy, snappy: I’m tired I’m not coming out. I am askance because it’s a leaving do. Can I meet him for breakfast instead, he asks. I’m away for the weekend, so decline, but say “come out for a drink instead.” He rings off in a strop. I’m angry, really angry: I’m humiliated in front of colleagues; he will cut me dead at work and create an atmosphere which I don’t need, as I’m vulnerable at work already. What really angers me if the sexes had been reversed? If I’d pestered a new guy at work, sending emails etc….. my manager would be pulling me aside and chastising me for harassment. "
"Although this is a small example of gender inequality in the workplace, it continues to frustrate me and for me exemplifies the normalisation of sexism… Where I work (at a supermarket), every now and then somebody needs to walk along the checkouts and collect the baskets and put them by the door for customers to take when they enter. On a team which is made up of a huge majority of women, why is it that it’s only ever the one boy on the checkouts who is asked to do this? Even though I, as with the other 4 or 5 women are just as capable and strong enough to lift a few baskets, that the one boy working there is asked to do it? If it happened a few times I would have no issue with this, but it’s been a weekly occurrence for over a year and I’m bored of them looking at me and automatically assuming that because I’m female, I must be too ‘weak’ and ‘delicate’ to carry a few baskets. I understand that physically women are born with a different muscle to fat ratio than men, but when its between a collection of physically fit, fairly strong girls, and one slightly overweight boy, why is it that every single time he’s the one asked? I’m probably making a huge thing out of a very small occurrence, but it’s the fact that nobody ever mentions this, and that it appears normal to assume that boys are more suited to any form of manual labour than girls – regardless of their age or state.

"Still, women are being told to cover up breasts and legs at work – we can have equality but only if we pretend not to be female…. “They’re probably not going to promote you and … take you up to meet a client if you’re wearing a mini-skirt or if your boobs are on show,” she said. “If the companies are going to send out people to meet their clients, they need to be completely professional.” More at the Sydney Morning Herald: NO LIP gloss, dangly earrings or opaque stockings.These are just some of the dress requirements Sydney’s young women professionals are being asked to adhere to by their prestigious companies, worried about the poor presentation of Generation Y employees and the impact on client relationships.Companies including Westpac, Clayton Utz and King & Wood Mallesons have all recruited style consultants to provide sessions on dress standards for young staffers. But the move has angered some younger workers and workplace experts. The bright red stockings Sydney accountant Rachel Bode wore to work on Friday would fail such a style test, despite her participation in a fashion seminar atwork. “They said to wear a suit every day, including a skirt, stockings and a belt,” Ms Bode, 25, said. “We did a make-up course as well. I didn’t like that. I think it’s personal choice whether you wear make-up.” Ms Bode said men were also invited to the session, but were only advised to wear a tie and to make sure their shoes were always clean. Style consultant Alex Frampton said she was regularly hired by major firms to present style advice that they were too afraid to give to employees. “They’re probably not going to promote you and … take you up to meet a client if you’re wearing a mini-skirt or if your boobs are on show,” she said. “If the companies are going to send out people to meet their clients, they need to be completely professional.” During her corporate sessions, however, Ms Frampton has received a backlash from younger women. “The legal girls were particularly focused on their rights and what they should wear,” shesaid. The Sun-Herald understands that, after a presentation by Ms Frampton at the law firm Clayton Utz, the firm was forced to apologise after several complaints were made by female employees relating to advice about the preference of skirts over pants. A spokeswoman from Clayton Utz last week said: “My understanding is that Alex [Frampton] came in as an independent presenter many years ago, and the views she expressed were her own, not the firm’s. Our female employees are certainly free towear trousers as part of their corporateattire.” A personal stylist, Chris Rewell, who runs her own company, created a prescriptive style document that has been presented at many firms. The 11â€“page document, obtained by The Sun-Herald, lists do’s and don’ts for women’s presentation in the workplace. Ms Rewell said Generation Y were leading a “casualisation” of dress codes in the workplace. “We are a visual species and the way we present ourselves needs to be appropriate,” she said. One of the firms that used the Rewell presentation, investment bank Barclays, said the two-hour session, run in December 2010, was designed only for women in its women’s network. “It wasn’t a Barclays initiative for the presentation, the women’s initiative network thought they should put on the program for the women,” a spokesman said. A professor of employment relations at the University of Sydney, Marian Baird, said companies were outsourcing such presentations as “risk minimisation strategies”. When a third party comes into the office, the company can then distance itself from “sensitive issues” or the risk of facing legal action, she said. “It’s a very difficult area to police and you have to be very careful,” Professor Bairdsaid. Professor Baird said she had also heard of young women in corporate workplaces being told they were not wearing enough make-up or their heels were not high enough. “I think it’s abhorrent,” she said.

"I am sick to death of being “told off” at work for behaviour, which, if exhibited in a man, would be lauded. I am, apparently, too assertive, whereas if I was a guy I’d be a “go getter”. I am also too direct whereas if I was a guy I’d be “dynamic”. I do not simper, I do not keep quiet, I do work hard and expect to be rewarded, I am a great leader. Oh! And I’m not bad looking. Which for some reason matters. So one of my very young male colleagues told me in the pub (he was drunk) that I was a “sexual predator” despite the fact I haven’t had a non platonic relationship with any one at my workplace and have been in a happy wonderful loving relationship with my male partner since before I started working there.

"Last night, hundreds of extremely violent, abusive, threatening posts were flooded on to this website. The level of vitriol made me feel extremely sad. This is a site which exists to allow women the opportunity to tell their stories, to record instances when they feel they are being unfairly treated because of sexism and to stand together in making a record of how bad the problem is so that we can tackle it together. Unfortunately the trolls seemed to feel unbelievably threatened by this simple idea. They suggested that women should be seen and not heard, that we exist to pleasure men, that we are sex objects, inferior and more. They were also very angry about their perception that we want to subjugate them, that we want to take control, and that we aren’t prepared to listen to their own stories of injustice. If this website succeeds, it will be because we have recognised one serious problem that exists and needs to be tackled in our society: sexism against women. This doesn’t suggest in any way that other equally serious problems are not out there too and I hope we will tackle those as well – sexism against men being one of them. But this website happens to be about sexism against women. Any men who feel that they’d like to share their stories are more than welcome to set up a sister site to collect them. But you wouldn’t log on to a website about racial prejudice and complain that it isn’t tackling the problem of homophobia, would you? I am focussing on this one, specific problem, because I feel it is such a huge mountain we need to overcome. I do not in any way disparage other problems by doing so. The message of this website is very clearly that women should not have to face harassment or inequality of treatment because of their sex, whether in the workplace, on the street or socially. It doesn’t suggest that women should take over the world. It doesn’t want to squash or subjugate men. We are fighting for equality. And sadly the hundreds of men who posted offensive, aggressive and threatening mysogynistic comments here last night proved how very important and ongoing that fight still is. So please raise your voices and share your story. "
"Did you know that during the past few years 19% of women have been made redundant but less than 1% of men? And that of those who have lost their jobs due to the recession, 80% are female? Statistics as extreme and glaring as these cannot be explained away by ‘women’s issues’ and ‘female choice to raise a family’ etc waffle waffle as male commentators so often try to do. They are proof that women are least valued in the workplace and first to be kicked out of the door. "
"My ex-fiancÃ© choked me on the last day I allowed the relationship to be. He told me I am too physically delicate and also told me I was too big to model ever again. He proceeded to try to ‘make’ me want to be 117-120 pounds at 5’10 with heart murmurs by saying “I felt closer to you when I could feel your ribs.” He would grade how I looked constantly, even with him being at least 100 lbs conservatively overweight and not showering all the time, and belittled my viewpoints on really everything. He told me corrective sex would make me not be asexual, I had this corrective sex for 1.5 years, I am still asexual. Happy he is out of my life. I am stronger now though. I do not date guys that want to have sex since I am asexual. I finally got to that point in realizing that no, my being this way since birth was not due to any kind of medication, I don’t smoke and drink, and am a clean vegan besides the occasional use of cow’s milk creamer when I am presented with coffee somewhere that does not carry almond milk and the like. I have become such a clean person to narrow down the grounds of possibility of why I am asexual. For example, if I took antidepressants or hard drugs – I would probably blame my asexuality on the side-effects of those drugs. I have never been raped. I have grown up happily and live well now, if not a bit underpayed. I don’t resist my normal self any longer. I don’t have sex because it’s normal and I am beautiful. I am by myself, asexual, and f*cking happy for the first time in my twenties. I will be thirty in 3 months. Find your truth and get away from the craziness faster than I did. "
"Was called a â€˜girlâ€™ by a male colleague while at a place of work. I am a woman over the age of 30. I passed puberty a long time ago. A female colleague was also called a â€˜girlâ€™ by this male colleague. We were referred to as â€˜girlsâ€™ even though we are both full grown women. At work, I do not call male colleagues â€˜boysâ€™ because that would be unprofessional because they have all passed the age of puberty. Calling out â€œHello boys!â€? would be a dodgy and disrespectful thing to do at work. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t do it. I just say â€œHelloâ€? or â€œGood Morningâ€? and address work colleagues by their first names. When I said to a female colleague that I was a woman and not a â€˜girlâ€™, she told me not to be bothered by it. She said: â€œYou think about things too much. You take things too seriously: he was just being friendly.â€? She laughed and smiled at the man and ignored my point of view. How is it that all of the males get called â€˜gentlemenâ€™ at that workplace? How come the females get called â€˜girlsâ€™ by this one male colleague? This sort of thing also happened when I was being â€œtreatedâ€? for â€œmental illnessâ€?. Female therapists would call all of the female and â€˜learning disabledâ€™ patients ‘girls’ and would call all of the male patients ‘gentlemen’. Males are allowed to grow up it seems, while females are doomed to be called â€˜girlsâ€™ (i.e. children) for the rest of their lives. This is especially true of learning disabled and mentally ill women. We are not allowed to be women, just â€œsweet, niceâ€? â€˜girlsâ€™. This infantilisation of grown women has to STOP NOW. I really feel for some women in leadership positions who get called a â€˜girlâ€™ by people and not a ‘woman’. These women worked so hard to get where they are and deserve the respect to be treated like adults. I donâ€™t dislike girls. I dislike the way that females are treated. I dislike the way that the word â€˜girlâ€™ is used as a derogatory slur by some males as in: â€œHe kicks the football like a girl.â€? The word â€˜girlâ€™ for me has a lot of trauma attached to it. The word â€˜girlâ€™ was used as a come on by males (one a close friend, one a fieldtrip leader and the other a landlord) as they tried to touch my body without my permission. Please never say the words â€œYou are such a pretty girl.â€? to me ever because it reminds me of those men and how they tried to take advantage of me. The word â€˜girlâ€™ is a box that females are forced into from the time they are born until they die. The â€˜girlâ€™ box is a prison for many because so many stereotypes are attached to that one word. If a male is called a â€˜girlâ€™, he is presumed to be incompetent. If the male cries â€˜like a girlâ€™ he is deemed to be incapable of making rational decisions. So thus, males are forced to conform to the â€˜manâ€™ box and to stay away from anything deemed â€˜feminineâ€™. The â€˜girlâ€™ box constrains females to certain activities and does not view them as individuals with their own aptitudes and preferences. If a male says: â€œBring on the girls!â€? then ‘dancing girls’ (adult female dancers) will parade in front of him for his entertainment. I remember a female teacher who said: â€œAll you girls stop giggling!â€? I was completely silent at this time, but she paid no attention to me. She just lumped me in with all of the other â€˜girlsâ€™ and called us a collectively â€˜gigglingâ€™. All the â€˜girlsâ€™ were called â€˜chattyâ€™ or â€˜gigglyâ€™ whether they moved their lips or not. Itâ€™s rotten to be stereotyped just on the basis of your genitalia. This is why, when I am working, I would prefer if people used more gender-neutral language so that I could concentrate. I do a unisex job and would like to be treated on the basis of how competent I am, not treated a certain way because of how someone perceives my gender. I wear no make-up to work because my work is dirty and outdoors. I wear practical clothes and trousers. I can lift the equipment, so gender should not be an issue when Iâ€™m working. I always call people by their first name and try and use as much gender-neutral language as possible. I never assume that someone is a â€œheâ€? or â€œsheâ€? just based on that personâ€™s appearance. I have been caught out a couple of times before. There are trans and gender-queer people out there who would prefer if gender neutral pronouns or their own chosen gender specific pronouns were used to describe them, rather than the first word that just happened to pop into someone elsesâ€™ head on first sight. We were never taught about gender-neutral language in the workplace in PSHE. We were never taught about gender identity or gender-neutral pronouns. We were never taught about workplace anti-discrimination laws. We were never taught about gender-queer, intersex or trans people. You guessed it: in PSHE all of the presumed female students in the class were called â€˜girlsâ€™ and all of the presumed male students in the class were called â€˜gentlemenâ€™ by the female teacher. Sighâ€¦ "
"Last week I asked two of the students of the language class I teach if the class was good for them or if they had any suggestions what we should cover in class.

"I was recently on the interview panel to recruit for a new member of staff I would be managing in my office. One of the interviewees, a man in his 50’s, said something about men as a neutral term referring to ‘human’ but then pointedly looked at me and said ‘oh and women too of course’. Apparently after he said this, while I was writing a note on my interview paper, he looked at my male colleague and winked. Needless to say, we didn’t hire him. "
"I work in retail, as a check-out chick in a supermarket. Last Thursday night I returned to my register to serve an man in his 40’s. Without speaking, he looked me up and down, then spat on me. I face all sorts of situations on a daily basis, theft, verbal abuse, aggressive behaviour, yet this incident sent me into complete shock. I was lucky that I only received his ‘gift’ on my arm, so I wiped it away, and silently served him, just wanting him to hurry up and leave. Still, almost a week later, I am struggling to grasp why this happened to me; I had not had a chance to offend him verbally, so I am left thinking that my appearance must have offended him or angered him for some reason. I am regularly called a f@&king C@%T and that doesn’t really register with me any more, but this assault on me has shaken me to my core. "
"I’m a manager in a male dominated work environment. One of my colleagues sometimes refers to having a “blonde moment” when he forgets things or similar.

But the more I thought about it the more enraged I got about it, after leaving it awhile I thought I can’t really make a big deal out of it because I didn’t say anything at the time. "
"Just a general grumble about working in a nightclub – why do men (or boys) feel that they can say things like ‘oh go on darling, make it a bit stronger’ or ‘i’ll make it worth your while to pop a bit more in’ or ‘you’re fit, give me your number’ or even simply wink at me in a ridiculous attempt to ‘flirt’ with me…? Why can’t women be left alone to do their work without being considered as objects who are only interested in having sex with the first man that pays them any interest? Another issue I have come across in this work environment is upon saying ‘no’, we are greeted with ‘alright f**k you, are you on your period or something?’. WHY CAN MEN BE SO DUMB SOMETIMES?! "
"When I worked in a pub restaurant I was told by one manager that if I was going to restock the fridges I had to let him lift the bottles, because it wasn’t safe for me. No male employees were told that it was not safe for them to be lifting heavy items. Most of the boys also wore safety boots to work, while the girls wore ballet flats or basic shoes, and only boys knew how to change a beer barrel. When I asked if I could be trained how to change one, I was ignored. After a year of asking, I learned how and soon afterward decided that it would be wise for me to wear safety boots when working in the cellar. I then spent a very frustrating day in town going around various shoe shops. When I asked if they stocked their safety boots in women’s sizes as well as men’s, I was frowned at and told ‘no.’ As if it were unusual for a girl to need to protect her feet in the workplace. When I eventually found a pair that fit and wore them to work, the deputy manager asked, “Why are you wearing those?” It seems that safety wasn’t a priority concern for the female employees at that bar after all. It was probably just easier to keep us out of the way so that the boys could do the hard work and heavy lifting instead. "
"I just finished a freelance job I do each year. I manage a group of people, all of whom I’ve known for a long time, including one guy who has made it clear he quite likes me. It is not reciprocal, which he knows since he tried it on to no avail many years ago. (FYI this guy is about 15 years older than me, I am 39 and didn’t expect to be feeling like this.) he did mention earlier in the week that he likes girls with big boobs (I fit this description!) When saying thanks/goodbye this guy backs me into a corner and puts his hand on my hip. I must have looked shocked, he pulled away and then it was hug moment. We eyed each other and I really hoped I would not have to hug him. It felt rude to refuse so I hugged and expected the usual lean forward with minimal body contact, just kinda shoulders and pat on the back. But no, full on body contact all the way down, just for a split second. I still feel really uncomfortable about it, especially when I remember exactly the same thing happened last year. Still considering texting him, but stupidly worried that I’m making a fuss and that he would be mortified. Made a note to self to never hug him again but I know the moment of refusal will be awkward. A colleague did note he had somewhat sleazy behaviour towards a much younger woman, and so I should say something for her sake as well. Feeling uncomfortable and creeped out. "
"Speaking about diapers with a coworker, who recently had a newborn, I suggested him to look after cloth/washable ones. “I don’t have time ” he replied “But you could do it for me, after all it will be very helpfull in your future”. ” I doubt it. We (my partner and I) don’t want kids”. ” I could help with it” he winked. "
"I was temping in a London Council two years ago. Another woman (redacted by moderator), in her twenties, had been sent to work in the same office on a six month basis from another department. She had worked for that council for several years and knew many of the staff. One of the men who worked on the same floor as us would make his regular daily visit to our office, four of us in total working in there including two men. Pest would make a b line for her and start making loud crude sexual comments to her, our manager a male friend of the Pest laughed along. I, who did not laugh, was and am absolutely shocked that this type of behavior was still going on in the workplace. I thought that those sorts of dinosaurs were confined to the 1980’s and before, back in the years when I was a young woman. I spoke to her about this when the others were out of the room. I said that I though Pest was going too far with his comments and that he was undermining her professionalism as a fellow worker by doing what he was doing every day. And that if she wanted to make a complaint I would be a witness. She did not want to, I think she wanted to stay in that department and thought that if she complained she would be sent back to her previous role as our manager was a good friend of Pest. The manager should have stepped in and told Pest to stop what he was doing, it was very unprofessional. That is what we are up against when men with the wrong attitude towards women are in positions of power. "
"In PSHE lessons, we were taught â€œstress management techniquesâ€? such as â€œbreathing deeply and relaxingâ€?. I am deeply suspicious of anyone who tells me to relax in this way because I have been betrayed by males who told me to do this. These males frequently harassed other women and thought that playing football â€œlike a girlâ€? was the worst thing a man could do! In PSHE there was all of this talk about how to calm down to fit in with the horrors of real life created by the system. There was no talk of trying to change the system or making it less stressful to benefit everybody! The terrifying thing is, that most people who told me to breathe deeply and relax basically told me that â€œWomen canâ€™t read mapsâ€? and â€œMen donâ€™t listenâ€?! I think that the main reason why some men â€œDonâ€™t listenâ€? is that they live in a society that doesnâ€™t value listening! In PSHE, we were told that if we had high enough â€œself esteemâ€? and â€œtried hard enough at schoolâ€? we could â€œbe anything we want to beâ€?. There was no practical talk on â€œHow to be a woman scientist, raise a family and look after disabled relativesâ€?. This lesson wouldâ€™ve helped me so much. We had no such lesson. Nada, zero, zippo, zilch! We were taught about reproduction, but bizarrely, nothing about the penalties women face in the workforce for having children. We were just told to â€œbreathe deeplyâ€? and accept all of the nonsense society threw our way. Raped? â€œbreathe deeplyâ€? Forced to have an abortion? â€œbreathe deeplyâ€? Stress out due to an inflexible education system that pathologises individual differences? â€œBreathe deeplyâ€¦â€? Sorry to be blunt, but I think that the last thing that depressed women need are teachers and social workers telling them to â€œbreathe deeplyâ€? when they face sexism and an inflexible system. What would really not make these women depressed is a more flexible and humane system. Talking to a therapist for hours about men who discriminated against you or abused you wonâ€™t fix the problem! These men will abuse and discriminate against others regardless of how deeply you breathe or how your therapist â€œmakes you feelâ€?. This is a plea. If youâ€™re going to encourage girls and women to do science, accommodate their needs if they want to have families or look after disabled relatives or are disabled themselves. Donâ€™t just expect by saying: â€œHey GIRLS, Science is COOL!â€? That this will make all of the sexism, ableism and racism magically vanish. It wonâ€™t. Only systemic changes will help with these problems. Then there are implicit biases which breathing deeply canâ€™t fix! Also, if youâ€™re teaching girls and women about science, do it in a balanced way please. Donâ€™t just include all of the positive stuff, but include ways in which science has been conducted unethically and harmed people. There were a lot of experiments and drug done on pregnant women that have gone wrong. Girls should know about these before yelling; â€œChemistry is Great!â€? Chemistry can poison and kill people. Science isnâ€™t all good. Scientific ideas can be inhumane to different groups of people, women included. Animals may be killed and tortured to develop new drugs. Science has objectified women and Psychiatry used to claim that women had â€œhysteriaâ€? for protesting against abuse. Science is a powerful tool. It has been used in warfare and to hurt women, men and children. Scientific rationalisation has also been used to oppress certain groups of people including women. There used to be an idea that women were mentally inferior to men because their brains were smaller. Now it’s “Women are not good at Science or Logical thinking because their brains are different to Men”. I am a woman who is depressed now who used to be really keen on science. I wish I had been taught how to see through illusions, think critically and do humane scientific research. Women and girls need to be taught about fabrication of results and scientific fraud. The futures of their families will depend on them knowing about and putting a stop to corruption in science. Corruption, systemic inflexibility and sexism cannot be solved by â€œbreathing deeplyâ€?. Also, what good do “body image lessons” in PSHE do, when many men judge women on women’s presentation relative to a “feminine” norm portrayed in porn videos, magazines and TV/Film regardless of how women see themselves? Making a woman feel good about her appearance will not stop her from being unfairly dismissed from work when pregnant or hostile sexism in the workplace. These things will only stop when the men (and women) being sexist towards women stop being sexist themselves! "
"I have worked in the butchers in the city I live in for several months now. When I was little we had a lady butcher in the village I grew up in and I can’t remember being aware of any sexism from the customers or other members of staff, although I was just a kid and I wasn’t in there all that often so I suppose I just didn’t pick up on it. Either way, I naively thought it wouldn’t be an issue, especially with being in the city now, I expected people to be a bit more forward thinking. The customers here regularly completely ignore me, ask for ‘a proper butcher’ and ask other members of staff questions I’m perfectly capable of answering while I’m in the middle of serving them. 9 times out of 10 the men I work with don’t seem to pick up on it, or if they do they just think it’s funny. One of them calls me ‘ditzy’ for harassing them with the same silly questions when the customer refuses to believe that I know what I’m talking about. A lot of the male customers seem to think it’s acceptable to comment on my appearance as well and will loudly announce things like, ‘it’s great that you’ve finally got some talent in here!’ to the other members of staff, again while I’m trying to serve them. I’m treated completely differently to the way the men are, which gets very wearing after a while. There is also one member of staff who continues to make inappropriate, sexual remarks to me whenever I have to work with him and has tried to put his hands on me on more than one occasion, despite knowing that I have no interest in him whatsoever. I tell him to stay away from me or else I just completely blank him until he starts behaving more properly. I do not feel comfortable speaking to my boss about it as it’s a small family business and the men have all worked there for years so I feel like even if they did believe me it would be more hassle than it’s worth, I know that might sound controversial but I’ve been in far far worse situations and for the time being I think I’m best just to keep my distance from him.

"When I’m at work, I’ve got headphones in and I have a male co-worker who is always asking me questions about work, interrupting me all throughout the day as if I’m supposed to be available to him. On top of that, he doesn’t listen. The other day, he started mocking me for having my headphones in as if he were annoyed that I’m not available to him at all times. This is the kind of crap men never do to other men. "
"I never paid enough attention, but women really are second to men in western society. I grew up with 2 older brothers, placid mother and emotionally aggressive father. As I grew up, I repeatedly saw my father emotionally abuse my mother to the point where she thought it would be better to leave rather then deal with his misdirected shit. I can’t say I wasn’t excited about this prospect, as I saw this periodically growing up. Regardless, she ended up staying and they are still together this day, except sleeping in different rooms. As I left high school, I too experienced emotional abuse. My older brothers were worshipped, no matter how stupid there decisions. whereas I was being ridiculed to the point I almost cut them all out of my life. I could go on, but my point is. I thought he was right because he was a man. During my teenage years when puberty was raging thorough all my class mates, I saw girls get dumped, humiliated and has spread stories about them. The boys would laugh at whoever was being embarrassed that day, and even the girls would join in. Hell even I did. That was until that same exact thing happened to me. I was dumped, humiliated and even had some grossly untrue stories spread about me. Yeah I didn’t think that was funny anymore. I didn’t consciously realise it at the time, but no one cares about what I had to say, they only cared about what the guy was saying and everyone, boys and girls flocked to his mouth to hear what he had to say, about how bat shit crazy I was, details of my vulva and you can imagine how this went. Both men and women validated what he was saying whilst there was only a close friend who could console me in the most humiliating time of my life. People actually value men’s opinions higher, they are somehow more true. While a women must be crazy or lying. Women love dragging each other down. Girls, just think about it, how many times have you heard a story about a girl you have never met, to laugh at them and put shit on them? I know I have. Even in general, girls, in the workplace, have you ever had to put your male colleague on the phone to a client because they don’t take you seriously enough? Only now in my mid twenties I am seeing a pattern. But hey, maybe it’s just me and how I grew up. Maybe I did some stupid things and I deserved to be humiliated. Or maybe, sexism is one of the biggest blind issues in our society. "
"Aspiring middle-european medical student here, I am only at the 4th year of uni (it takes 6 years in my country), and I have been considering pathology or forensic medicine as my future profession, since these catched my attention the most, and I passed the exams with an excellent qualification (not to brag, but just like my most exams, I am really passionate about my medical career, and I think I have the brains to do it right). What were people’s reactions, when they asked me about which specialty will I choose in the future? “You’re too pretty to become a pathologist” -a surgeon ” How are you going to have kids? Maybe you’d be happier as a family doctor. It’s not all about the money”- a nurse from the cardiology ward “I don’t want my granddaughter to work with corpses and crime stuff, that’s just so horrible. You won’t be able to bear with all that emotionally. Why don’t you become a pediatrician? It’s so much nicer to work with kids.”- my gradmother (I really dislike kids, by the way, sorry gran.) “That skirt on you just makes me as stiff as this dead bloke here”- pathology technician trying to flirt (over a stiff body, of course) “Forensics?? That’s totally an all-male field, do’t expect much success there.”- a fellow male classmate “How will you tell your kids, when they ask what do you do for a living? Like ‘well, mommy cuts up dead people for money’!!?”- female classmate (Again I’m really not into having kids, but if I change my mind any time, I hope my kids will be smart enough to understand that a pathologist does a very complex diagnostic work with modern technology, and yeah, sometimes we cut up corpses. These are what come into my mind now, but I get similar reactions most of the time. I am really looking forward the day when I break out of this s***hole town, and become a succesful doctor, and they get stuck in their miserable little lives. "

"I once went to a party after work, it was the first job I worked in after school and I had only just turned 20. It was one of those end of the year parties, which meant a lot of alcohol and a long night. Towards the end of the evening I was sitting with to work colleagues talking. I was complaining about a project that I had to get done a how stressed I was. My college, who was ten years older then me at the time, put his arm around my shoulder in what seamed a sympathetic manner. But suddenly he stared groping me. I didn’t know how to react at all. It had never occurred to me that this could or would happen. Not that I had never had similar experiences before. I had gotten used to the everyday sexism like everyone else. But this was my college, who I knew, respected and on certain level liked. I took his of me and stud up so his arm would no longer be on my shoulder. He told me to:” let him” (fondle me). He told me:” not to be a prude, to enjoy it”, told me:” that I could always tell him to stop if went to far”. I said that had already told him to stop. At this point he got mad. He said that since I was shy and overweight no one would ever want me and that I now had the opportunity to sex with him and that I should take it. All the while the other work colleague sat there and said nothing. I went home at that point, feeling ashamed and worthless. He apologized the next day. Which seemed to mean for him that everything was ok after he had done that. So he could understand that I tried to stay away from him as much as possible after that innocent, which lead to numerous angry outbursts on his part. "

"I went for an interview for a cleaning job. The man interviewing me seemed ok and he took me to the cleaning cupboard. He wanted me to sit down on a chair where I would have been trapped saying that he wanted to look at my shoes. I felt uncomfortable and said that I could show him from where I was and I lifted up my foot. He insisted on me sitting in the chair and I didn’t want to make a fuss so I did. I thought maybe he wanted to look at the bottom of my shoe to make sure it wasn’t going to leave marks on the floor. He asked if he could take my shoe off. I thought it was a bit odd but he said that he needed to make sure my feet were healthy as it was his responsibility to ensure his staff were ok to work. I said ok but inside I felt like I wanted to run out the door. He took off my shoe and started running his finger up and down my foot. He found several fake reasons to need to start the conversation again and therefore start running his hand over my foot again. It tickled and felt sensitive and I was wincing. he then said can I just tickle your foot, I love tickling feet and he started tickling the bottom of my foot. I tried to pull my foot back several times but he wouldn’t let go until I said in a firm tone *let go of my foot please!* he did and I put my shoes back on and went towards the door. I didn’t know what to do, I had never been in that situation before so I carried on with the interview but wanted to leave. he showed me round offices alone and I was scared. I later called the cleaning company to complain and was told that it was a franchise and there was nothing they could do. "
"Hi, I have always been what people would say an ‘unusual’ girl, I have a twin brother and when I was a child I was never interested in playing with dolls etc; I was more interested in being out with friends or my twin and going on adventures and playing with cars/trucks etc etc. While growing up and I became a teenager; a lot of people would joke and insult me saying that I must be a lesbian because I wasn’t ‘girly’. With one bloke saying that ‘when rach eventually comes out as a lesbian, I will have ‘told you so’ tattooed on my forehead’. Funny enough, I am not a lesbian and have been with my male partner for 9 years now at the age of 25 years old and am very happy with him. However, this problem continued; I then left school and became very interested in technology. I attended my local college studying a national diploma for ICT; as you could imagine this is a male dominated industry so I had several comments from fellow students etc. This wasn’t to bad, as the head of the course was an older female and very much encouraged me which resulted in me being at the head of the class, gaining 16 distinctions and 2 merits for my work and applying and being accepted into the university of my choice to study digital forensics. Then I started my digital forensics course, overall this wasn’t a bad experience; had a few comments over the years such it would be easy for me to get a job because I am a girl in a male dominated industry. Apart from this; all was good and I passed my degree and then started my masters course. I finished my masters course and now was the proud owner of a diploma, degree and masters in ICT/digital forensics. I applied for hundreds of digital forensics job and my second interview I was offered the job on the spot. In the meantime; a family friend was staying at my parents house. One evening I left the living room for 2 seconds and he turned on his X-box; I asked if it was ok for me to finish my programme and then he could play his console. He said no, so I unplugged the x-box. At this point; he threw the remote at the wall (just missing my head) and then ran across the living room and launched an attack on me. I was pinned against the wall by my neck, so badly I could barely breathe. He then let go and I dropped to the floor where he started to kick me in the face and ribs. I was then dragged along the floor by my hair (while clumps of hair were being ripped out) and then when he let go I looked up and asked him not to do this; he then punched me several times in the face. Luckily; my dad was upstairs and heard me scream who came down to see what was happening and then grabbed him off me and they started fighting. I dialled 999 on my phone, ready to ring the police but stood and thought about all the questions and then locked my phone and didn’t ring. The family friend ran out of the house after this. After this; I seen my injuries. I had clumps of hair missing, couldn’t brush my hair because of the pain, bruising down my neck that could only be described as love bites; busted lip, bruising on my face and body and couldn’t move because of the pain in my ribs. This was a massive knock to my confidence; especially as this family friend was like family so who could I trust. Anyways, in the meantime; I brushed myself off and got on with things. I had a new job to start and I wasn’t going to let him wreck that; which took all my strength as in reality I felt like hibernating in my bedroom and forgetting the world. I started my new job but one thing was very obvious I was the first female investigator within that company being a male dominated industry but there was 1 female manager which provided encouragement. However, everyone was very nice; management good etc. On one occasion; a bloke came down to my office for training. The topic of women was bought up into the office. Now keeping in mind I am the only female in a all male office. He was saying things like ‘I would bang the shit out of that’ with the other males joining in with the ‘banter’, then said at the end of the day ‘women are objects and are for one thing’. At this point, I felt so uncomfortable and didn’t know what to say or do. I did what I thought was best and packed my stuff up and left work early. When I arrived home after much consideration on my journey, I got straight on the phone and rung the only female manager and made a formal complaint. She was brilliant and apologized profusely. I was provided the next day off work fully paid and they came down to the office to provide him with disciplinary action and his original training was terminated. He went back to his office and I came back to work to continue my training in a new role as an investigator and he was made to say sorry and warned that is on his record anything else and it would be instant dismissal. It’s now been 2 years since these problems, it still causes some issues such as when a male raises his voice my hands start shaking and I get flashbacks to my attack; but have been seeing a counselor about this and am in a very different position now and would phone the police if that happened again. But on the positives I been promoted and am now doing work for police forces throughout the country for a wide range of crimes committed each and everyday; I complete talks on internet safety at primary and high schools, after my attack I have even taken up Brazialian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai boxing which I love and keeps me fit. The company I work for has since employed more female investigators and I have even been written onto the university website for my success. And I done all this by just being me and not submitting to what society believe a woman should be, still no make up/dresses and love my technology and MMA fighting skills along with using my skills to help others.

"I saw a question on an online forum, “Girls, what’s a creepy thing guys do that we’re unaware of?” I replied that I found it creepy when men shake the hand of every man present as a greeting/farewell gesture but kiss all the women on the cheek. Even if their relationships with the men and women are exactly equivalent. I find it creepy that they think it’s ok to invade my personal space and kiss me without my consent just because I’m a woman. Then someone came along and started mansplaining about this custom being around for hundreds of years so I should just accept it and “stop taking it personally.” Okay. Racism, murder and theft have also been around for hundreds of years so should we just accept those too? I responded to say just because women have politely tolerated something unpleasant for all that time doesn’t make it OK and I *did* find it creepy that men who hardly know me think it’s fine to force this level of intimacy on me. Even those who do know me, come to think of it. The other day my father-in-law was saying goodbye and he patted my husband on the back and kissed me on the cheek. Why show me more intimacy than his own son? I hated it, I hate being kissed by anyone other than my husband and daughter and it makes me feel icky but I’m expected to put up with it because I’m a woman. The other person on the forum said I couldn’t expect everyone to magically guess what physical contact I was or wasn’t OK with. I said that was exactly my point. They couldn’t do that so they need to ASK FIRST. They gave all my comments negative votes even though I was polite and respectful throughout. I suspect this person enjoys forcing their kisses on women without their consent and doesn’t like being told we don’t enjoy it. "

"Need some advice. I am female and use the women’s toilets. I am only attracted to men. I do not use make-up other than clear chap-stick to protect my lips because I see make up as a form of dishonesty to conceal one’s true intentions (plus men don’t have to wear it to be taken seriously so why should I!). Also make up containing muscovite mica often contains stone sourced from child labour in India. I do not want to support the exploitation of children in mica mines, hence I do not wear blusher or eyeshadow. I also wear trousers and don’t go in for women’s fashions. I use gender neutral names online and never disclose the fact that I am female. When I present as gender neutral online, I rarely run into difficulties. People keep calling me a “lady” in real life even though it makes me feel uncomfortable and makes me feel like I don’t fit the restrictive gender mould that people try and shove me in. Work bosses, teachers, public transport drivers and random people on the street have called me this. It kind of irks me a little when adults tell their children to “Thank the nice lady (me?!)” if I hold the door open. A simple thank you with no “lady” attached will do. I don’t carry around a parasol, cotton gloves or wear a dress so I am really not a “lady” at all! I don’t know, short of binding my chest in a very oppressive way or disguising my hips in a dishonest way, how will I stop people calling me “lady”? I don’t really want to subject my body to this physical stuff or any invasive expensive surgery. I just want to be me in my own body. People keep making comments on my female body, so it is often very hard to be happy in my own skin. It is worse when other women are around in because people say “Hello ladies” to all of us. Ugh. I would just say “hello everyone”, not ladies now because I am aware that some people may have other gender identities. I don’t feel like a “lady”, I feel like a female person who just wants to be called by the greeting “hello”. Being called a “lady” seems to give some men (some, not all, some men are nice and considerate) the right not to listen and talk over me. I never really was comfortable with being called a “lady” or being treated like one. I am happy just to be referred to as a woman, female or my name (though I really wish that I could change my real life name and title to something more gender neutral!). People can see that I look uncomfortable when I am called a “lady” so what should I do? Should I explain to them that I used to watch Robot Wars and play video games as male characters or would that be a complete waste of time? I really don’t want to seem unfriendly or rude, but at the same time, I am really unhappy with being shoved into the “lady” gender stereotype box. I remember ages ago watching a woman on TV with a short haircut who said that while they had female body parts, this person didn’t see their body as belonging to any particular gender. This person was their own identity. I thought that this person was awesome when I was young. I still think that this person is awesome now! "

Photographer says how he had forced his wife to take his name because she was only small (he gestures to indicate her height) and makes other similar comments, but also drops in that he’s ‘really a feminist’ (presumably to protect himself against any accusations that he was being sexist). If he was a feminist he should know better than to make such a fuss about a woman keeping her own name!
